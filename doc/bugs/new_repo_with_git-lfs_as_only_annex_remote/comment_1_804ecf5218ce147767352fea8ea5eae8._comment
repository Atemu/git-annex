It seems to me there are two possible mistakes you could have made, both
of which are much more likely than a bug in git-annex. They are:

1. You forgot to push the git-annex branch to origin, so your clone was not
   able to see it.

2. When you say you "set up the same git-lfs special remote" again,
   you mean you used `git-annex initremote` again. Which sets up a
   *different* remote with a different uuid. The right thing to do would be
   to use `git annex enableremote`. (Or indeed to get git-annex
   auto-enable the git-lfs special remote when it sees you cloned the same
   url that was used to set it up)

If you still think you have a bug, you'll need to show me a list of
commands that I can use to reproduce the bug.
