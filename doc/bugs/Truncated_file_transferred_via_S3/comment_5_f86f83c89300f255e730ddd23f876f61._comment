Good thing I set up obnam a while ago :)

Anyway, yes, a very similar pattern of corruption can be seen here. It might be worth nothing that it starts in a different place in the file. The one I'm looking at now begins at byte 0x1C, whereas it was a little bit further into the file previously.

I created a large file that'd make the issue really clear and synced it over, and of course, everything worked perfectly.

Here is a pair of small files that shows the problem, from around the 0x4BC mark.
