Thanks for point out the channel omission in the message.

I was able to reproduce the issue, but only with `conda create --override-channels -c defaults -n new-test-env-03 python=3.8 ` .  When I instead create the initial environment with `-c conda-forge`, the issue doesn't recur.  I guess it makes sense: packages in conda-forge are pinned to be more compatible with each other, but not necessarily with packages in `defaults`.
