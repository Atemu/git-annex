Hi there, I couldn't get it to build with cabal (likely my fault, ie. inexperience).

Can I please confirm something: Theoretically I dont need to do *any* preparation to start using git-annex assistant, right? As in I dont need to first configure git separately, or set up any folder hierarchies or such?  The idea is that the assistant itself does all that's required? I just wonder if through my naivety I am missing a basic step and making a rookie mistake.

A couple of notes:

Running  **/Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex init** 

Returns **git-annex: Not in a git repository.**

Any further assistance you may offer woudl be great, because I'd love to start investigating the potential for using git-annex in a multi-user environment (managing motion design projects).
