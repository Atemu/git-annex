### Please describe the problem.

When the reflog is empty, time-based `--in` expressions give scary messages that makes it look like something is really broken.

Instead of `Fatal: Log blabla is empty` and `Broken pipe` a reasonable message would be e.g. `warning: Log for 'refs/heads/git-annex' is empty.`

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Emptying reflog for `refs/heads/git-annex`, then using an `--in=here{date}` option to e.g. `git annex fsck`.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

`git-annex version: 5.20140412ubuntu1` on Ubuntu Trusty.

### Please provide any additional information below.
