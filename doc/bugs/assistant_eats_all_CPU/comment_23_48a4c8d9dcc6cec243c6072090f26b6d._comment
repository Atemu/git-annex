<maxy> the clock_gettime(0x2 and clock_gettime(0x3 are consistent with getCurrentTime and getTimeZone of nextTime

So, that strongly points to the Cronner thread, and I doubt this is specific to stable at all.

Please run git-annex vicfg, and paste all the \"schedule\" lines, from a repository that has the problem. That should allow me to reproduce and fix this bug.
