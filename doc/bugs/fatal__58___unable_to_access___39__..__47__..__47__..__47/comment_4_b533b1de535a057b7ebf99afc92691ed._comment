So this is a problem with msysgit 1.8.4. I have been able to reproduce it with that version. 1.8.3 did not have the problem.

Seems to perhaps be due to the cygwin xargs flipping git into cygwin path mode somehow. (How all this works is massively complex and confusing to me.)
All the other calls to git with identical parameters work fine. I can also reproduce the problem using some old git 1.7.x in the cygwin terminal.

BTW, I noticed in your example that you ran \"git commit -a\". You should **never** do that in a [[direct mode]] repository. Read the direct mode documentation to understand why.
