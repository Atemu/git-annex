git-annex 0.16 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * git-annex-shell: Avoid exposing any git repo config except for the
     annex.uuid when doing configlist.
   * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a remote whose UUID was not yet known
     could result in git-annex not recording on the local side where the
     file was moved to. This could not result in data loss, or even a
     significant problem, since the remote *did* record that it had the file.
   * Also, add a general guard to detect attempts to record information
     about repositories with missing UUIDs.
   * bugfix: Running `move --to` with a non-ssh remote failed.
   * bugfix: Running `copy --to` with a non-ssh remote actually did a move.
   * Many test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 65%"""]]
