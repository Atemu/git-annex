In fact, `git annex add` does not process the v6 unlocked file at all
since it only looks for unstaged changes to files and the unlocked file's
type change has been staged already.

In v5 mode there is a separate pass to add unlocked files, which is
necessary since they have to be converted back to locked files before they
can be committed.

It would need a separate pass in v6 too, since the main pass looks only
at unstaged modifications and git can't be queried for staged modifications
at the same time as unstaged.

Hmm, this would though mean that `git annex add` would now be changing
what's staged. It has never done that before; it's only staged new changes.
Not convinced by that argument, but something to keep in mind.

I'm feeling this is ok to change, and the patch is not difficult.
