### Please describe the problem.
When creating a https webdav repository under openbsd it complains that /etc/ssl/certs doesn't exist. This is true considering all certs are stored in /etc/ssl/cert.pem.
After /etc/ssl/certs is created it complains about that the certificate has an unknown CA, for obvious reasons.

A workaround is to symlink /etc/ssl/cert.pem in /etc/ssl/certs

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
