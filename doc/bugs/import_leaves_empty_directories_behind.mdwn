### Please describe the problem.

git annex import leaves empties directories behind.

now maybe that's desired, but in this case, why are the *files* gone and not the directories?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

<pre>
mkdir -p /tmp/foo/bar
touch /tmp/foo/bar/file
git annex import /tmp/foo
[ -d /tmp/foo/bar ] && echo 'fail: directory still there!'
</pre>

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
