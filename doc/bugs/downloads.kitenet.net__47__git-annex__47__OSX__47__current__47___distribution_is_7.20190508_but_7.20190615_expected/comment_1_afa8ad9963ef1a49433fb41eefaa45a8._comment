Yeah, the OSX autobuilder has I think not had a sucessful build since May.

I just copy over the latest autobuild when doing a release.

I tried a manual build and it failed with "hdiutil: create failed -
Resource busy" which is a way that hdiutil seems to just fail from time to
time, with no indication anywhere on the internet of why. In my experience
such failures tend to clear up after maybe 24 hours, presumably when
whatever resource it's trying to use stops being busy.
