Based on the usage output, it seems to be running a recent enough version
of git-annex, which should notice if it's being run as a proxy for ssh.

Some kind of problem with the environment variables used to communicate
with the git-annex proxy seems like the most likely problem.
But, I am not able to reproduce this problem on Windows (XP) here.
The `GIT_SSH` env var is clearly being set, or git wouldn't try to run
git-annex as ssh. The `GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION` env var is set in the same way
as `GIT_SSH`. Maybe git-annex is failing to see it for some reason?

Since you're comfortable with building git-annex from source, maybe you can
try some simple patches to debug this?

Here's the first patch I'd suggest. it will make git-annex print out
what value, if any, it's seeing for `GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION`. Note that you'll
need to install the patched git-annex into the path.
