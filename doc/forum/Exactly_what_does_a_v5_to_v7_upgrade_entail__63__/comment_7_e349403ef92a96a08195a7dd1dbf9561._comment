\"a few files just a bit larger than that are commited to git\" -- if it's just a few, maybe set `annex.largefiles=nothing` explicitly for each of them in .gitattributes?  (Also then set `annex.largefiles=(largerthan=100kb)` in .gitattributes rather than in git config, since that overrides .gitattributes).  But in general it would be better if files already in git were not annexed even if they match `annex.largefiles`.
