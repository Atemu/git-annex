Another use case for a user-defined string field in a key is, for URL or WORM keys, to include additional information unique to the object.   E.g. for an s3:// URI (handled by an external special remote) could embed the ETag in the key.   Or for a dx:// URI to include the DNAnexus file ID .

From [[internals/key_format]], it seems like adding -uXXXXXX- (with XXXXXX a user-specified string) would not break compatibility?
