> Does that sequence match what you were doing? I didn't reproduce the problem when just upgrading the v5 and then getting the unlocked files into it.

I don't *exactly* remember, unfortunately, but that seems likely. It matches my previous comment, which indicates I upgraded to the backport *after* filing the bug report anyways.

> Seems that the upgrade to v7 process, after scanning for and populating unlocked files, needs to update git's index. I thought it did, but perhaps I forgot or that is not working.

Makes sense! :)
