Hi,

### Please describe the problem.
I have a distant repository in backup mode acting as origin and 2 computers at home containing that repository in manual mode. Everything is in indirect mode and watched by git annex assistant.
If I get a file on one local computer from origin, everything act as expected, I have a copy on that file on origin and on the local computer.
But, if I then want to copy the file over to the other local computer by issuing a git annex get on the second computer with a --from option specifying the first local computer, the file is transferred but when the transfer is completed the file is dropped on the first local computer.

If I try and retrieve the file from origin, I don't have that problem and the file is kept on every repository I issued the git annex get command.

A bigger problem is that if, still on the second local computer, I start transferring a file from the first local computer and I interrupt the rsync process, the file is still dropped by the first local computer although it is not yet on the second.
It is still on the origin so no data is lost but I don't think this behavior is really intended.

The version of git-annex I use is as follows:

On the two local computers (from the ArchLinux aur):
git-annex version: 5.20140716-g8c14ba8
build flags: Assistant Webapp Webapp-secure Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus DesktopNotify XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA CryptoHash

remote types: git gcrypt S3 bup directory rsync web webdav tahoe glacier ddar hook external
local repository version: 5
supported repository version: 5
upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2 4

On the server (debian stable, standalone git-annex archive):
git-annex version: 5.20140716-g8c14ba8
build flags: Assistant Webapp Webapp-secure Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus DesktopNotify XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA CryptoHash
key/value backends: SHA256E SHA1E SHA512E SHA224E SHA384E SKEIN256E SKEIN512E SHA256 SHA1 SHA512 SHA224 SHA384 SKEIN256 SKEIN512 WORM URL
remote types: git gcrypt S3 bup directory rsync web webdav tahoe glacier ddar hook external
local repository version: 5
supported repository version: 5
upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2 4

It should be the same version everywhere.

Please ask me if you need more information.
