I meant to say in it wasn't reliable when I was following the instructions for \"Comment 12\". I did find that just doing a  \"git annex copy -t externalusb .\"  then a \"git annex drop .\" from the root of my cloned and \"none trusted\" annexed repos to be more reliable, it just means I temporarily need a load of space to get myself out of my earlier mess.

On testing this bug fix, I found a minor behavioural issue with [[git annex copy -f REMOTE . doesn't work as expected]]
