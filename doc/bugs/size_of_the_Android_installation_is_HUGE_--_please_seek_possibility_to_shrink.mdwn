### Please describe the problem.

ATM git annex assistant app is the largest one installed on my phone.  I simply keep hitting the available storage space limits and keep pruning some apps

According to file
$> file lib/armeabi/lib.git-annex.so
lib/armeabi/lib.git-annex.so: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), not stripped
so largest annex's .so is 133M and is not stripped.  stripping it seems to half its size: 

$> ls -l lib.git-annex.so 
62052 -rw------- 1 yoh yoh 63468304 Nov 25 22:21 lib.git-annex.so
$> file lib.git-annex.so
lib.git-annex.so: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped

so may be it could be the first step to make the .apk and installation itself more lightweight and thus easier to "manage"

thanks in advance
