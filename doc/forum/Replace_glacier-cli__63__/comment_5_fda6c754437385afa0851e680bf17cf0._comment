@abimelech, why don't you work up a branch that makes the glacier special
remote be implemented with amazonka. If you want to start with a
separate utility that git-annex runs, that would be ok, but I think that
the goal should be for git-annex to end up using amazonka itself.

Once that happens, switching the S3
special remote from aws to amazonka would be a natural next step, which I'd
be inclined to work on myself. Seems easier to take this path than an
immediate leap to amazonka for everything.
