If the repository did not get switched from direct mode to adjusted
unlocked branch, and does not use any unlocked files, you can:

* remove the filter.annex.smudge and filter.annex.clean from .git/config
* remove .git/info/attributes (or at least the filter=annex line)
* remove .git/hooks/post-checkout and .git/hooks/post-merge
* remove sqlite databases (all of .git/annex/keysdb* .git/annex/fsck/ .git/annex/export/ .git/annex/cidsdb*)
* change annex.version

To get back from adjusted unlocked branch to direct mode, you'd first want
to check out the master branch, and then do all of the above, then `git
annex direct` to get back into direct mode.
