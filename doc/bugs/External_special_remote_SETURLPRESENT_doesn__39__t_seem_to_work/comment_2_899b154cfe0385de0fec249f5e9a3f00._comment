Well, gcsannex didn't exist until last weekend.  I hope people find it useful.

You're correct about what is happening, and I agree that the public URL shouldn't appear to be another copy of the file.  I was hoping to avoid requiring `enableremote` in a clone, but I see that the S3 remote [does also](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/public_Amazon_S3_remote/).

I'll look at supporting unauthenticated reads through gcsannex directly.  I'll add support for `whereisKey` if you decide to expose it; AFAICS it's only used in the output of `git annex whereis`, which is convenient but doesn't seem to be critical.
