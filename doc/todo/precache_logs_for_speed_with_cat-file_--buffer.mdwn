that ls-files the worktree may be sped up by using cat-file --buffer
to get location logs (and maybe other logs) more efficiently,
and precache them.

Another thing that the same cat-file --buffer approach could be used with
is to cat the annex links. Git.LsFiles.inRepoDetails provides the Sha
of file contents, which can be fed through cat-file --buffer to get keys.
A complication is that, non-symlinks could be large files that are not
annexed but in git; don't want to cat those when looking for annex links.
That would probably need pre-filtering through a cat-file --buffer that
only gets the size of the blob, not its content.

Also, limits that look up keys still do, before the keys are looked up
efficiently. Avoiding that would speed up --in etc, probably another
1.5x-2x speedup when such limits are used. What that optimisation needs
is a way to tell if the current limit needs the key or not.
If it does, then match on it after getting the key, otherwise before
getting the key.
