You can run git-annex p2p --gen-addresses repeatedly. Each address
can be given to one entity you want to grant access to the repository.

That way, if you choose to revoke access later, you can revoke just one.

Not that there's currently a command to revoke, but it just deletes
the address from .git/annex/creds/p2pauth.

If you'd like to contribute, you could maybe improve the documentation
so it's clearer that --gen-addresses can be used repeatedly, 
or add a --remove-address or something like that.
