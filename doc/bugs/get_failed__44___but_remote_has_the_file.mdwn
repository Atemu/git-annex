Not sure what caused this, but I have a file that exists on two remotes, but I can only get it from one of them.  If I try to get it from the other, it fails immediately (without even connecting):

    get Show - S03E08.mp4 failed
    git-annex: get: 1 failed

Same `git annex version` on both `pilot` and `bucket`, and I ran `git annex sync` on both.

    git-annex version: 3.20130114
    local repository version: 3
    default repository version: 3
    supported repository versions: 3
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2

How should I debug this?
