I'm releasing a fix now.

It didn't seem practical to make git-annex automatically clean up any
encrypted data that got stored by mistake. For one thing, this leakage may
have consequences that git-annex users will need to work through on their
own. (sigh) Also, I just didn't see a good way to make it automatically
delete it.

So, the release announcement just has this advice for how to recover:

	If your remotes are affected, you will want to make sure to delete
	any content that git-annex has stored on them that is not encrypted!

	One way to do so is, before upgrading to this version,
	run git-annex move --from the affected remotes. It will move
	only the content that was not encrypted.

I think that will be sufficient for most. It's also possible
that some may need to run `git annex fsck --fast --from` on affected
remotes, if git-annex got confused about encrypted content that was stored
on them not being present, because it wrongly was looking for non-encrypted
content. I think that would only be necessary if a similar fsck was
run earlier using the broken git-annex version.

If you have encountered this problem and need help with recovery, post
a comment.

Very sorry about this mess. [[todo/network_test_suite]] is needed to
be sure such problems are caught.
