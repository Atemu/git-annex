I'm finding it would be useful to have a conda package variant based on the standalone git-annex version (the normal variant has dependencies that sometimes conflict with other packages).  So it would still be useful to fix  this issue (another example of it is [here](https://dev.azure.com/conda-forge/84710dde-1620-425b-80d0-4cf5baca359d/_apis/build/builds/127349/logs/10)).  If `md5sum` is not available, maybe can use `cksum`?
