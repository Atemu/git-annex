### Please describe the problem.

When copying files to s3 using,

    git annex copy --quiet --to mys3 --fast

No information whatsoever is printed during upload when ran without `--quite` it prints a line for each file in the repo creating page after page of output for repos with thousands of file basically no way to tell which files got uploaded. Is it possible to have a verbosity level between quite and verbose that only reports progress on actual copy/move operations.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
