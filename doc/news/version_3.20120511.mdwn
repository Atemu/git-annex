   * Rsync special remotes can be configured with shellescape=no
     to avoid shell quoting that is normally done when using rsync over ssh.
     This is known to be needed for certian rsync hosting providers
     (specificially hidrive.strato.com) that use rsync over ssh but do not
     pass it through the shell.
   * dropunused: Allow specifying ranges to drop.
   * addunused: New command, the opposite of dropunused, it relinks unused
     content into the git repository.
   * Fix use of several config settings: annex.ssh-options,
     annex.rsync-options, annex.bup-split-options. (And adjust types to avoid
     the bugs that broke several config settings.)"""]]
