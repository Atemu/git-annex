### Please describe the problem.
Running fsck on a remote completely drops the file

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
* Create a standard git annex repo
* Set up another remote (I used a standard git annex repo) in it
* Corrupt a file in the remote repo. Changing one byte is sufficient for this
* Run `git-annex fsck`
* git-annex will notice the corruption and completely drop the file from the remote

I expect git-annex to never drop data unless specified as also mentioned [here](https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/fsck__58___when_things_go_wrong)

I would rather look at the corrupted file myself and figure out the best course of action instead of losing it completely.

At this point, I'm no longer running fsck on remotes.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
8.20200309, Mac


### Please provide any additional information below.

~~~
$ ga fsck --from=origin
fsck dir1/dir1_file1 (checksum...) ok
fsck dir1/dir1_file2 (checksum...) ok
fsck file1 (checksum...)
  file1: Bad file content; dropped from origin
failed
fsck file2 (checksum...) ok
(recording state in git...)
git-annex: fsck: 1 failed
~~~

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes it stores most of my data
