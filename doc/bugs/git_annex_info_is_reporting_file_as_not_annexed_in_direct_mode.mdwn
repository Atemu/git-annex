### Please describe the problem.

I was thinking to answer Emanuele's question in forum (http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/test_whether_a_file_is_already_annexed/) but realized that 'info' is not the way :-/ (whereis could be used I guess)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20150826+gitg87972f5-1~ndall+1

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """

$> git annex indirect     
commit  ok
indirect 1.dat ok
indirect  ok
ok

$> git annex info 1.dat
file: 1.dat
size: 4 bytes
key: SHA256E-s4--181210f8f9c779c26da1d9b2075bde0127302ee0e3fca38c9a83f5b1dd8e5d3b.dat

$> git annex direct    
commit  
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean

direct 1.dat ok
direct  ok

$> git annex info 1.dat
git-annex: 1.dat is not a directory or an annexed file or a remote or a uuid

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
