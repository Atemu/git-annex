It seems to start to connect to db48x.net, and hang. It may be failing to parse the response about the password being bad, or something like that, and be sitting around waiting for a response. I'm not sure.

What XMPP server software are you using?

The next step would probably be to get a tcpdump of the XMPP connection, ideally with SSL disabled. (Assuming the hang is not occuring during the SSL setup.)
