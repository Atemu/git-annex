> Implemented CoW for directory special remote, comprehensively.

woohoo -- I will give it a shot! (might as well just interrupt ongoing \"process\") 

it is good that it copies content -- that is the point for use of CoW here - to gain a full copy of the content virtually at no (storage) cost, so if original directory gets it changed - its copy would be all nicely versioned etc in the git-annex land ;)
