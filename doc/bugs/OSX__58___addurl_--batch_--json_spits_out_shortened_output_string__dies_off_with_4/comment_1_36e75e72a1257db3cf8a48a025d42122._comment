OSX signal 4 is SIGILL; git-annex test fails similarly, but so far I've only
had the problem be reported on this same datalads mac; I don't know how
widespread the problem is.

Occurs to me it could well be libmagic that's dying. That would be
consistent with the point it fails, and IIRC with where git-annex test was
failing. Any use of annex.largefiles will cause the magic library to be
initialized.

I've seen libraries taken from homebrew (as libmagic is)
be aggressively optimised for the host CPU and sigill on others.

I've re-installed that using `brew install --build-bottle` now.
Hopefully that will fix the problem.
