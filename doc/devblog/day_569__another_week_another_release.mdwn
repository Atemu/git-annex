Today's release is to fix a
[data loss bug](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/potential_data_loss_after_late_enabling_of_S3_versioning/),
that affects S3 remotes configured with exporttree=yes that got versioning=yes
turned on after some unversioned data is stored in them. If you use the new
versioning=yes feature with S3, please upgrade.

Also, there are only two days left to fill out the
[git-annex user survey](http://git-annex-survey.branchable.com/polls/2018/)
if you have not already.
