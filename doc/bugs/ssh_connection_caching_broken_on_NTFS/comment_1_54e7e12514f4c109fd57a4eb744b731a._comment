This failed because ssh connection caching needs fifos,
which are not supported on NTFS. Also, the linux NTFS code behaves most strangly when asked to make a fifo; creating an empty file instead and then failing with EEXIST.

In more recent versions of git-annex, you can set the `GIT_ANNEX_TMP_DIR` to point somewhere that supports fifos.

Recent versions also try to detect crippled filesystems, and disable use of unix sockets along with symlinks etc.
However, since ntfs supports symlinks, and it does not probe specially for fifo support, this won't help.
