### Please describe the problem.

When the assistant decides to sync the content of a file, it launches rsync. Windows shows an Application Error popup which says this:

    The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b).

Presumably it's crashing.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Not on windows so far :)
