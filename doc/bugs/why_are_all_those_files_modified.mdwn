Following up on [[todo/clarify_that_v7_applies_to_all_clones]], the
next step was to fetch all content from the central, still v5
repository, which worked fine.

But weirdly, some files showed up as modified:

    $ git annex get
    [...]
    $ git status
    ## master...origin/master
     M calendrier/photos/DSCF0879.jpg
     M calendrier/photos/DSCF1191.jpg

Strangely, git doesn't see which changes are present here:

    $ git diff
    [... takes some time, but no output ...]
    $ 

Workaround: `git checkout .` - but I don't understand why that is happening in the first place... Is that a bug? -- [[anarcat]]

> update: yes, and it was [[fixed|done]] by joeyh.
