git-annex tries to prevent this kind of thing by removing the write bit
from the the object storage directories. But I suppose that doesn't prevent
those directories from being renamed themselves (or from it turning on the
write bit to rename files inside them, if it goes so far). 

In the end, git-annex just can't help you if you feed your drive into a
indiscriminate shredder. Except helping you have a copy of the data in a
repository elsewhere. So I don't see how this is a bug in git-annex.

But surely it's a massive bug in detox if it does anything inside .git or any
VCS directory?

Anyway, the result after running this thing is similar to fsck having put
all your annexed objects in lost+found with useless names. I'd recover the
same way, by moving the annexed objects from .git/annex/objects into the
repository, and running git-annex add on them, so it will pick the same
hashes as before and will move the objects back into place.
