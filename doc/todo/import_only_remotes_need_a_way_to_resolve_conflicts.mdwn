If two conflicting trees get imported from an import-only remote, it can
end up in conflict, the same as an export conflict. Except, git-annex
export cannot be used to resolve it, as it's import-only.

Seems that git-annex import should be able to resolve the conflict in this
case. What ever tree it imports is, after all, the tree that's on the
remote now, so just resolve the conflict to say it's the current one
in the export log. But I've not thought through it in detail yet.
