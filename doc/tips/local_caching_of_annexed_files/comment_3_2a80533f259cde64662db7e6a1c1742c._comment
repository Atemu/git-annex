I have two cache repos -- `cache` is just a regular one and `cache2` with those tuned up parameters:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$> git annex merge       
merge git-annex (merging cache/git-annex cache2/git-annex into git-annex...)
git-annex: Remote repository is tuned in incompatible way; cannot be merged with local repository.

\"\"\"]]

and it didn't merge any of those which is good -- we do not want a possibly monstrous history of the cache to be merged into every repo using it

But then when I remove that `cache2` git-annex does merge it:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$> git remote rm cache2
$> git annex merge     
merge git-annex (merging cache/git-annex into git-annex...)
(recording state in git...)
ok
\"\"\"]]
which imho shouldn't happen -- annex shouldn't merge \"cache\" histories into this repository git-annex history.  I guess there should be one more config option to set for those remotes?
