Good Idea. In cases with a centralized repo and a lot of clients that don't directly exchange files with each other, this can be used to disable (useless) location tracking on the clients so the git-annex branch doesn't get bloated.

Regarding `git annex add` in a hidden repo. I guess it will just add a empty location log for the new key to the git-annex branch, right?
