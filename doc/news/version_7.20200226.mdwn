News for git-annex 7.20200226:

   There was a serious regression in gcrypt and encrypted git-lfs remotes.
   Since version 7.20200202.7, git-annex incorrectly stored content
   on those remotes without encrypting it.
   If your remotes are affected, you will want to make sure to delete
   any content that git-annex has stored on them that is not encrypted!
   One way to do so is, before upgrading to this version,
   run git-annex move --from the affected remotes. It will move
   only the content that was not encrypted.

   * Fix serious regression in gcrypt and encrypted git-lfs remotes.
     Since version 7.20200202.7, git-annex incorrectly stored content
     on those remotes without encrypting it.
     If your remotes are affected, you will want to make sure to delete
     any content that git-annex has stored on them that is not encrypted!
   * info: Fix display of the encryption value.
     (Some debugging junk had crept in.)
   * Bugfix to getting content from an export remote with -J, when the
     export database was not yet populated.
   * Bugfix: export --tracking (a deprecated option) set
     annex-annex-tracking-branch, instead of annex-tracking-branch."""]]
