If you have a bug where concurrent adds fail due to some locking problem,
please file a bug report. This is not the correct place to discuss that
problem. 

[So far all you've shown is that a git index file lock,
which could be a stale lock or a lock due to some git operation not under
the control of git-annex, causes git annex add to fail. Since git-annex
takes it own lock before any operation that touches the index file,
I'm quite confident that concurrent git-annex adds do not interfere with
one-another. See Annex.Queue which uses withExclusiveLock when flushing
the queue.]
