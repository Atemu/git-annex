Yes, true, git-annex has some inconsistent parsing of these.

It's certianly at least a bug worth fixing that the Git.Config parser only
supports "true" and not "1" and "on". (And IIRC git-config also has a
special case for true boolean settings that has only the setting in the
config file, without a value -- which git-annex also may not parse.)

On special remotes, Kyle's right. Same reasoning also applies to 
booleans set by git-annex config. I don't immediately see any good way to
add a translation layer to either when things are set, it would be an ugly
addition in both cases.

I don't feel git-annex necessarily needs to mimic git here in accepting
all those things. It's well known that not all of git's UI choices are good,
and git-annex does not mimic all of them, eg git has some very nasty
positional --switch parsing.

But readonly and autoenable using true/false while all other special remote
configs uses yes/no is not good UI either.
