Thanks for adding annex.jobs .  Could you make it so that setting it to 0 means \"use all available processors\"?  I use git-annex on AWS instances, and reserve instances with different processor counts at different times.

\"git-annex is rarely cpu-bound\" -- I though parallelization helps by parallelizing I/O operations such as file transfers?
