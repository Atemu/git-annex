As of today, I have backported everything except for haskell-lens, haskell-dav, and haskell-network-protocol-xmpp. The last is the only real blocker (I can build a backport without webdav support..). 

The haskell-network-protocol-xmpp in stable is actually ok, except it needs to be rebuilt against the haskell-gnutls I uploaded today. This fixes a bad segfault bug. I don't know how to handle this situation in backports TBH, and so am stuck waiting for a newer version of haskell-network-protocol-xmpp to reach testing, to get around backport's requirements that the backport version be in testing.

In other words, it'll happen in 2 to 5 weeks, probably..
