Since there is a separate todo item [[external_backends]], let's not
discuss that idea here.

key/f would have been a great idea to have had 10 years ago.
(Although it does mean that if the object file somehow gets moved out of
its directory, there's no indication in its name that it's a git-annex
object file)

But if that's all this todo is about, we'd need some kind of transition
plan for existing repos with history containing symlinks to key/key. 
I doubt there is a good way to make that transition.
