I had that issue, git-annex is installed on a noGUI remote machine so the directory and the file **~/.config/git-annex/autostart** didn't exist.
I think it worth to mention than you could create by hand **~/.config/git-annex/autostart**

> mkdir ~/.config/git-annex/; touch ~/.config/git-annex/autostart

and in simply add the path of your git-annex you want to start such as **/srv/data** for this example (*which contain a .git/annex/ directory*) then you are ready to go

> cd /srv/data; git annex assistant --autostart
