Hi Joey,

Seems that I can still get this to choke on a VFAT system:

    poker% sudo mount -o loop,gid=25,fmask=0117,dmask=0007 /home/phil/nobackup/annextest-image/vfat-annex-test.img /mnt 
    poker% mount | grep /mnt                                                                                      
    /home/phil/nobackup/annextest-image/vfat-annex-test.img on /mnt type vfat (rw,relatime,gid=25,fmask=0117,dmask=0007,allow_utime=0020,codepage=cp437,iocharset=utf8,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)        
    poker% cd /mnt 
    poker% git init

perhaps I shouldn't be trying that anyway -- I was wanting to create a direct mode repo on each of my camera's SD cards, which the camera will happily ignore, but allows me to add new photos to the repo by plugging the card into my laptop, and then copy them elsewhere using git annex magic.  I'm hoping that would allow me to leave favorite photos on the camera, for showing off photos when without my laptop, while not becoming confused about which photos I've already got copies of and can safely delete (with annex's drop telling me when I try to delete things I shouldn't).

The reason not to use a special directory remote (at least I think this is right judging from the wiki info) is that the camera won't grok the filenames under .git/annex/... so the photos need to be left with their names as created by the camera.

Anyway, while experimenting with that idea, I bumped into the above, which seems like a continuation of this bag.
