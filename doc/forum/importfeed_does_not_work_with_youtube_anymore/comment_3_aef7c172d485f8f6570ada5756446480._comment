There is actually a way to construct a rss feed url that will work,
but nowhere in youtube can you find the url.
[[tips/downloading_podcasts]] discusses how the url looks like; finding the
`channel_id` value for a given youtube page tends to involve grepping the
html or some third-party tool.

If youtube-dl had a way to extract the `channel_id`, I suppose I might make
git-annex use it. Although leaving the user to jump through the absurd
hoops google has set up to find an rss feed does highlight just how
user-hostile and standard-hostile Google is being here; it sends some
important signals to the user about the entity they're interacting with,
their business model, and how likely the rss feed is to break in the
future.
