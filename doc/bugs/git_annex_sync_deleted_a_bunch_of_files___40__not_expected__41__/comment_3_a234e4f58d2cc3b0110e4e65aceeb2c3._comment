> My conclusion is that some repository, perhaps the usb drive, made a commit that deleted those files. You should be able to find this commit with git log --stat, and can just git revert it if you want to.

It would be surprising if I did that.

Anyway, I was not able to find which commit deleted the ~600 files. I just decided to re-start completely with git annex :-/

The good thing is that I did not lose any file, so in that regard git annex is great ;^)

However, one thing that is quite confusing to me is the way git annex [sync] works.  Am I supposed to run git annex sync in every repository? Because if I just run it once in 1 repo, then I usually don't get all the syncing done. Maybe I just don't understand something.

Thanks for replying,
