It's not necessary to download `wget` in Termux since it already comes with
`curl`.

However the installation guide instructs to install `wget` in order to fetch
the installation script `git-annex-install` from the internet. Also the script
itself relies on `wget` and installs it as a dependency even though the
preinstalled `curl` could be used just as well.

I think we should use `curl` to reduce the amount of dependencies which have to
be additionally installed.
