git-annex uses the xdg-open command in termux to open the webapp,
so you will probably get the same error message if you run a command like

	xdg-open http://google.com/

So this is a problem with termux, or perhaps something in your Android is
preventing termux from communicating with it correctly. It's not a problem
I can address in git-annex, so I'm going to close this bug report.
