Understandable mistake. If you might have more such files,
you can `git config annex.dotfiles true`

Well, if you run `git annex export somesha --to remote`, all it knows is
the tree for that sha, so it has to match relative to the top of that tree,
and not whatever other tree it might be embedded in on master or wherever.

When you run `git annex export master:subdir --to remote`, it has enough
information that it could match relative to the top of master, but that
would be inconsistent.

And the same with a config setting annex-tracking-branch to master:subdir.

Import does also do the same thing, it has to also for consistency of
course.

I have mentioned this in the docs now.
