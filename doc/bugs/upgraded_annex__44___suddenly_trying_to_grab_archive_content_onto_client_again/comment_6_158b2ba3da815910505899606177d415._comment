I'm glad this wasn't a nasty bug!

I'm not really sold on its current behavior WRT archive directories and backups.  It seemed to make sense at the time.. The differences between archives and backups are subtle enough that I'd sort of like to avoid confusing them by making backups be sorta treated like archives.

Nor am I entirely thrilled with the current hardcoded \"(copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)\" that makes any given file be stored in only 1 archive repository. What's really wanted, but cannot currently be expressed with preferred content syntax is \"(archive + smallarchive >= numcopies)\"

If it did that, sounds like you could convert your usb and ssh remotes to be archives and not need anything custom?

I think that, as things stand, the only way to get what you want without a custom expression is to set one of the remotes, perhaps the SSH remote, to be an archive repository. Then files will be copies to both SSH (because it's the only archive), and to the USB backup (because backups want all files). And once both have a copy, numcopies will be satisfied, and files in archive/ directories will be archived, so the client will drop them.
