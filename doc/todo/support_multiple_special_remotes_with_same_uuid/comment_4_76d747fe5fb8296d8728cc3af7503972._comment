Started a `sameas` branch for this.

Logs.Remote.configSet will need some changes because it currently works
on the basis of UUID, and so can't know when it's supposed to change a
sameas remote. It will need an added RemoteName parameter.

The RemoteConfig is generated each run from the remote.log, and so the
handling of sameas remotes needs to be done in Logs.Remote.readRemoteLog
not by enableremote.

readRemoteLog makes a `Map UUID RemoteConfig`, which will need to
change to `Map (UUID, RemoteName) RemoteConfig`

Digging into changing readRemoteLog, there are several problems. Here are
some of the less tractable ones:

Remote.List.remoteGen looks up RemoteConfig by UUID. While it does have a
Git remote and could look up the name of the remote from that, if the user
renames a remote in .git/config, that would confuse it. That is not an
acceptable tradeoff. So, a sameas remote would need to have some additional
git config be set, giving the namespace that's used for it in the
remote.log. If that's missing, it un-namespaced. initremote/enableremote
need to set that git config.

Annex.SpecialRemote.autoEnable uses readRemoteLog. It would likewise need
to look at the git config for namespace to tell which sameas remotes
have been auto-enabled.

Preferred content looks at the preferreddir= value from RemoteConfig,
and only a uuid is available. So it would have to look at the preferreddir
values from all RemoteConfigs for remotes with that uuid and somehow pick
one consistently. Or, preferreddir could be inherited like encryption
settings are, and not allowed to be set in a sameas remote's config.
