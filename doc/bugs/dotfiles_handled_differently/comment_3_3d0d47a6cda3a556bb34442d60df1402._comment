\" git-annex add skips dotfiles unless explicitly listed. It always has!\" -- not sure why it hasn't crashed my use case before (thought I'm re-running on same data); but maybe, reconsider this default?  Since `git add .` adds everything, it's easy to assume (as I did) that `git annex add .` does too.  Why not add dotfiles to regular git, rather than skipping them outright?
