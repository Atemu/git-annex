I think conceptually that's a good fit.  You could set
`importtree=yes` with the special remote and ingest changes with `git
annex import` on beta's side.  However, the rsync special remote
doesn't support `importtree` yet.

In your followup comment, you mention unlocked files.  That would get
you around the link problem.  You could call `rsync` with `--checksum`
to limit what is transferred, though that might be expensive depending
on how big your files are.

You can set then at the repository level in the repo's .git/config.
