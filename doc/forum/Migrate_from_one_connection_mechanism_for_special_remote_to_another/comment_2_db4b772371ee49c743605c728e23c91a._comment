By using 
    git show git-annex:remote.log

one can extract the cipher from the old remote and set it with

    git annex enableremote $newremote cipher=$CIPHER

However, then I ran into a new problem. The git-annex-remote-hubic special remote created files with leading slashes (/GPGHMACSHA1--00021a41c3143f1e52f16af93625d1072e861543).
Rclone, and I don`t even mean git-annex-remote-rclone, cannot access these files. It interprets the slash as directory separator which leads to those files not being found.

I guess I will just reupload to fix the slash error in the first place. Or find a Hubic client that can deal with slashes and rename the objects remotely.
