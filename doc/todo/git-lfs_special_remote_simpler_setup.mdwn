It would be nice if a clone from eg, gitlab could autoenable the git-lfs
special remote. Currently, autoenable doesn't work for git-lfs special
remotes at all, because the url is not stored.

What if, an url or urls passed to initremote were stored. Then when
enableremote/autoenable runs, if it sees a git remote with a known url,
it sets that remote up with annex-uuid and annex-git-lfs set, instead of
adding a new remote. That might need changes to the Remote setup method,
not sure.

Or, Remote.Git could, when enumerating remotes, call into Remote.GitLFS
to check if the url is one it knows about, and if so, autoenable
the special remote. Although that would mean reading remote.log when
enumerating remotes, which I think is currently avoided, and might be too
much overhead to add to git-annex generally for the value of this feature.

Many urls could be used to clone the same LFS repo. http(s) and ssh are the
obvious two or three. Now that `initremote --sameas`
[[is available|support_multiple_special_remotes_with_same_uuid]],
special remotes can be initialized for all the urls. The user would need to
do that themselves probably.
