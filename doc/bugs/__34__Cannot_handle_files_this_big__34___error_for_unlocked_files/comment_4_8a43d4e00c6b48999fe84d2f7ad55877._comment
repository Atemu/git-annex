git version is 2.26.1, so this should be fine.

I guess, git-annex couldn't do it any better, still git tries to overallocate memory.
My Synology NAS only got 1gb of memory (at least 600mb are used all the time), so I wonder why \"hanging up\" the pipe works when unlocking 1gb file but not for 2gb. But the Synology linux is a little bit weird, so I have to give up on debugging there. The 1gb memory spec of my NAS is ridiculously low (maybe too low for git anyways) and cannot be upgraded....

For the sake of documentation for other synology users with a low-spec NAS

Workaround that did work

* create a user with uid/gid matching the NAS user and mount via NFSv3. On the client system the memory is sufficient to run every git-annex command.

Workarounds that did not work out

* NFSv4 with idmapping (configuring the Kerberos authentication would have taken a lot of time and not even sure if it would have worked out in the end)
* SSHFS (the sshfs server provided by Synology seems to be broken, resulting in broken symlinks on my linux client system -> which is obviously a no go for git annex ;-) )
