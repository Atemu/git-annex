git-annex 6.20160412 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * adjust --unlock: Enters an adjusted branch in which all annexed files
     are unlocked. The v6 equivilant of direct mode, but much cleaner!
   * Upgrading a direct mode repository to v6 has changed to enter
     an adjusted unlocked branch. This makes the direct mode to v6 upgrade
     able to be performed in one clone of a repository without affecting
     other clones, which can continue using v5 and direct mode.
   * init --version=6: Automatically enter the adjusted unlocked branch
     when filesystem doesn't support symlinks.
   * ddar remote: fix ssh calls
     Thanks, Robie Basak
   * log: Display time with time zone.
   * log --raw-date: Use to display seconds from unix epoch.
   * v6: Close pointer file handles more quickly, to avoid problems on Windows.
   * sync: Show output of git commit.
   * annex.thin and annex.hardlink are now supported on Windows.
   * unannex --fast now makes hard links on Windows.
   * Fix bug in annex.largefiles mimetype= matching when git-annex
     is run in a subdirectory of the repository.
   * Fix build with ghc v7.11. Thanks, Gabor Greif."""]]
