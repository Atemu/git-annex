We're using git-annex to manage large files as part of a team.

We have a central repository of large files that everyone grabs from.

We would like to be able to get the files without updating the `git-annex` branch.  This way it doesn't pollute the history with essentially always unreachable locations.

I think the easiest way would be to just add an option to not update the `git-annex` branch when `annex get` is executed.

Thoughts?
