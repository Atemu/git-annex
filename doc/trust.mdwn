Normally, git-annex does not fully trust its stored [[location_tracking]]
information. When removing content, it will directly check
that other repositories have [[copies]].

Generally that explicit checking is a good idea. Consider that the current
[[location_tracking]] information for a remote may not yet have propigated
out. Or, a remote may have suffered a catastrophic loss of data, or itself
been lost.

Sometimes though, you may have reasons to trust the location tracking
information for a remote repository. For example, it may be an offline
archival drive, from which you rarely or never remove content. Deciding
when it makes sense to trust the tracking info is up to you.

One way to handle this is just to use `--force` when a command cannot
access a remote you trust.

Another option is to configure which remotes you trust with the 
`git annex trust` command, or by manually adding the UUIDs of trusted remotes
to `.git-annex/trust.log`.
