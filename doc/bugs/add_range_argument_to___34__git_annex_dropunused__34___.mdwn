The command `git annex dropunused` currently takes a number, as referenced in output of last `git annex unused` command.

When you want to drop all, or a range, this may be annoying, as you have to specify each number on the command line. 

A range argument, such as `1-1845`, possibly combined with other argument types (Cf. many print dialogues: `1,3,5-7,9`) would be great.

I work around this lack as I want to drop all unused files anyway by something like this:
       
    git annex unused | grep -o -P "^    [0-9]+" | xargs git annex dropunused

	git annex dropunused `seq 1 9` `seq 11 1845`
