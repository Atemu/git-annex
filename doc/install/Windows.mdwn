git-annex has recently been ported to Windows!

* First, [install git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Then, [install git-annex](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/)

This port is in an early state. While it works well enough to use
git-annex, many things will not work. See [[todo/windows_support]] for
current status. Note especially that git-annex always uses [[direct_mode]]
on Windows.

## building it yourself

To build git-annex from source on Windows, you need to install
the Haskell Platform and Cygwin. Use Cygwin to install gcc, rsync, git,
ssh, and gpg.

Then, within Cygwin, git-annex can be compiled following the instructions
for [[using cabal|cabal]].

Once git-annex is built, the NullSoft installer can be built, as follows:

<pre>
	cabal install ncis
	ghc --make Build/NullSoftInstaller.hs
	Build/NullSoftInstaller.exe
</pre>
