### Please describe the problem.

git-annex is back on the radar now that the jabber requirement has been dropped! :-)

But, it seems as though when I create a remote repo via the webapp it always makes it a bare git repo.  Even when I specify the "client usage grouping".

If I manually create two repos on ssh enabled servers, manually link them, and fire up the assistant they are awesomely kept in sync (with no bare repo in sight).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Use the webapp to try to create a client usage remote repo.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Latest as of post.

### Please provide any additional information below.
