`git annex sync --content` behaves differently for directory or SSH resources.

I use the directory resource on two external hard drives to sync between them. They always get mounted to the same mount point.

When syncing from one USB drive to another, git-annex iterates over all files in the annex. This takes a long time even if only one file got added.

When running git-annex in one of the USB drives and syncing with SSH, git-annex only does the file transfer necessary and does not iterate over all files.

I'd like to have the SSH behavior also for syncs between USB drives. Is that possible?

Also, how does git-annex make the decision?
