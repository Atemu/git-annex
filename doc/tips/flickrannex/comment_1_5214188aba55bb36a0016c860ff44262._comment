Looks very handy.  I am just starting with this, but can't seem to get it working as a remote after following the simple walkthrough.  All goes well until:

$ git annex copy . --to flickr
copy walkthrough.sh (checking flickr...) 
  missing configuration for flickr-checkpresent-hook
git-annex: checkpresent hook misconfigured
