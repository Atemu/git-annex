I'm sorry to ask this again, but I'm not being able to find my previous message regarding this issue. I'm finding very hard to find older posts in forums. Is there a way to search for all my posted messages?
Anyway, after some automount problems (changed mount point name), my usb repo ended in a weird state.
See for instance the screenshot: <http://picpaste.com/git-annex-problem-eZvOl90y.jpg>

In addition making a git-annex info gives the following:

 * repository mode: direct
 * trusted repositories: error: refs/heads/master does not point to a valid object!

What should I do? delete the usb repo and start again. Thank god this is just a trial.
Thanks in advance.
