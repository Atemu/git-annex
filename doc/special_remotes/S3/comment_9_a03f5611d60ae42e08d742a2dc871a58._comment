Thanks for the clarification Joey.

Another question, today I tried to copy a large file into S3 and got the following error at the console.

    copy large-file.tgz (gpg) (checking cloud...) (to cloud...) Reading passphrase from file descriptor 12    
    
                        
     Your proposed upload exceeds the maximum allowed size
     failed
     git-annex: copy: 1 failed

The files size is 7.4G
