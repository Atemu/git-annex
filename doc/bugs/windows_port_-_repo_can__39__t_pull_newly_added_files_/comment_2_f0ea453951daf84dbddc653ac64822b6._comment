joey, Thank you for the reply. I have read that and also read about the direct mode guard. I only used git merge because I was stuck and didn't know what else to do. I assume the proper way to refresh my backup repo is to git annex sync. That's what's failing with the non-fast-forward error. I don't know what to do from there. Thank you for any help.
