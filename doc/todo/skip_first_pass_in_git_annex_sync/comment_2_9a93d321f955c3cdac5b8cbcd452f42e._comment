One side effect of this optimisation is that, while sync --all used to
tell the filenames it was getting or dropping, when operating on files
in the working tree, when the optimsation is enabled it will only
display the keys. So, its behavior in 2 different repos might seem
inconsistent to a user, who doesn't know about all these gory 2 pass details.

I think, if that became a problem, the best fix would be to only display
the keys, and never the worktree filenames, even when running the first
pass. But I'll wait and see if that needs to be done, I suppose.
