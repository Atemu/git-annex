@Ilya, importing before exporting does not avoid losing any data that gets
written at just the wrong time. Versioning is the only way to guarantee no
data loss.

If you enable versioning for the bucket and then disable it or don't
version some items, git-annex won't notice and if you then do an export I'm
afraid you again risk losing data.
