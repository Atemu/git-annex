I would like to go the cabal way without knowing anything of Haskell, and assuming it is something like cpan for Perl. (Let me know if I'm wrong ;) )
When I use the above command, I constantly experiencing failed installs because of missing packages. So far I had to install XML Sax, gsasl, c2hs, zlib (zlib1g-dev libghc-zlib-dev) with apt-get.
I'm using Ubuntu, and the repo version is very old.

Could someone please list the dependencies at least by project name (not package name, but this would be better)?
Thanks in advance.
