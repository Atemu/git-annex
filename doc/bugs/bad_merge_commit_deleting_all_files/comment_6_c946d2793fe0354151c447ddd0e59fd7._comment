* Sure enough looking though the git log, I found one that removed 81
files. It was useful to grep for 'deletions'.

* It turned out there were actually two, one from each of the two
git-annex-assistant machines. I had to do the revert separately on each
machine for the corresponding commit that it had made.

* I typically run the latest version that the webapp offers, within
about a week or so of it prompting me (unless I'm away for a while).
This means that maybe you can track down the approximate version where
this occured by looking at the two commit dates of the \"bad\" merges:

* I use the command line for pretty much most of what I do. Funny enough
though I only really use git-annex through the webapp.

* Bug wise I don't know if this is relevant, but I have done the
following:
> added/changed/removed files to ~/annex on computer one while git-annex
wasn't running
> added/changed/removed files to ~/annex on computer two while it wasn't
running
> started git-annex on computer one
> started git-annex on computer two
> and similar combinations of the above...
