This only affects using with regular git remotes.
All special remotes have an encryption config, which it inherits, but
regular git remotes do not have that config.

Note that, regular git remotes can be accessed via git-annex over http just
fine without using httpalso.

It might make sense for httpalso to reject trying to be used with a regular
git remote. 

Or it could force the equivilant of encryption=none in that
case. I would expect it to work then, if the url pointed to the
.git/annex/objects directory.
