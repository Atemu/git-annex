# NAME

git-annex numcopies - configure desired number of copies

# SYNOPSIS

git annex numcopies `N`

# DESCRIPTION

Tells git-annex how many copies it should preserve of files, over all
repositories. The default is 1. 

Run without a number to get the current value.

This configuration is stored in the git-annex branch, so it will be seen
by all clones of the repository. It can be overridden on a per-file basis
by the annex.numcopies setting in .gitattributes files, or can be
overridden temporarily with the --numcopies option.

When git-annex is asked to drop a file, it first verifies that the
number of copies can be satisfied among all the other
repositories that have a copy of the file.

In situations involving trusted repositories or special remotes that
cannot lock content in place, the numcopies setting may be violated
when the same file is being dropped at the same time from multiple
repositories. In these unusual situations, git-annex ensures that
the requirednumcopies setting (default 1) is not violated. See
[[git-annex-requirednumcopies]](1) for more about this setting.
