It probably depends on the version of the cabal library you have installed.
Older versions may not print much debugging, and also seem much more likely
to run out of memory while resolving dependencies.

As I mentioned, using stackage is a good way to present cabal with a canned
solution so it doesn't fry its mind trying to discover one.
