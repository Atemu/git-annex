### Please describe the problem.

I have some files that I want to drop from my laptop. However, as soon as I drop them (git-annex drop), the assistant starts to download them again from another repository. At first glance, this seems like a variant of [[bugs/Handling_of_files_inside_and_outside_archive_directory_at_the_same_time]].

I would expect that after an explicit drop command, the files would not be re-downloaded.

The repository that this is happening on is a "client" type, direct-mode repository.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git annex drop drop-test/TestFile.data

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
    git-annex version: 4.20130618-g333cb8e
    build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP DNS
    local repository version: 4
    default repository version: 3
    supported repository versions: 3 4
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2

    I am running Ubuntu 13.04

### Please provide any additional information below.
