Hi Joey --

As one of the people having used the word \"hijacked\" previously, my apologies.

I was trying to express frustration, surprise, and a feeling of loss of control. But I do see how my phrasing could sound too adversarial and potentially like it's ascribing something like malice where there's clearly none.

For what it's worth, that's not at all the meaning I intended to convey (as I said, I very much appreciate your ongoing work!), but message received: I'm happy to change how I phrase things like that if it'll make for more constructive conversation.

Thanks!
