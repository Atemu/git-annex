The git-annex dmg includes a copy of gpg.

It seems that the build machine has been switched to having MacGPG2 installed, which hard-codes the location of gpg-agent inside it. This did not used to be the case, and I don't want to use this MacGPG2 build in the dmg.

Guess I'll have to build gpg from source myself on the mac to get a sane version to distribute..
