It's true that importfeed calls Url.download to download the feed file, 
without bothering to support annex.web-download-command. That could easily
be changed.

However, it also uses Url.getUrlInfo, which does not and cannot use the
annex.web-download-command interface, and which is too complicated an
interface to make into a hook.

Indeed, annex.web-download-command was never intended to cover all
the ways git-annex uses http, but only uses of http to download
large file contents. And importfeed does use it for such downloads,
but not for its other http needs.

To configure use of a proxy, you would probably be best served by using
the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` environment variables, which are
supported by wget, curl, and by the haskell http library that git-annex
also uses.
