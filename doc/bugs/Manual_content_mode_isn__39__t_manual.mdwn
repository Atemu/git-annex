### Please describe the problem.

The `manual` content mode doesn't follow the description provided in the help page, instead it seems to collect content.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create a new git annex repository using the webapp, set the content type to `client`.
2. Create another repository, and set the content type to `manual`.
3. Copy something into the `client` repository.
4. It will be pushed/pulled into the `manual` repository.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

    git-annex version: 4.20130521-g25dba9d
    Ubuntu 13.04 x64.

### Please provide any additional information below.

I have also noticed very weird behaviour that I have been unable to replicate in testing, but I will describe the setup that it currently happens in:
I have 3x repositories, one a `client` repository, and the other two are set to `manual`. When put a new file into the `client` repository, it is pushed onto the two `manual` repositories. When these repositories have received it, the client drops the file and re-downloads it from one of the `manual` repositories. Once it's been pushed, deleted, and pulled, everything is happy... but the extra step makes no difference.
