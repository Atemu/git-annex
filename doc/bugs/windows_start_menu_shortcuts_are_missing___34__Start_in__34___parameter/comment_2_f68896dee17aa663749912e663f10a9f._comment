Yes, Git is in my path. This is my full (system, not user) path, copied from System Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables:

    C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%\System32\Wbem;%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\;C:\Program Files (x86)\QuickTime\QTSystem\;C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd

I've done some more experimentation now. I believe that in Windows the current working directory is always first in the path. I also think that \"Start in\" sets the CWD of a shortcut and if unset, its CWD is its location in the Start menu. The shortcut is named git-annex.lnk and executes a VBscript that runs \"git-annex webapp\". This is probably why the shortcut executes itself.

Setting the Start in parameter to anything (doesn't have to be Git's installation directory) *or* renaming the shortcut to something other than git-annex makes it work. A third way of fixing it is to open git-annex-webapp.vbs and changing \"git-annex webapp\" to \"git annex webapp\". I don't know which option is the cleanest solution.

I take it back that git-annex-autostart loops. I seem to remember that it did on another computer (running a version of git-annex downloaded today) but probably remember wrong. Now I can only reproduce this with the webapp shortcut.
