I did more digging and I it looks like the issue is that I have a very old version of git (2.2.1) installed via brew that was taking precedence over the system git (2.11.0). Taking that out of the mix made everything work.

Also, by just using `runshell`, it worked as well. I may switch to using that method of adding git-annex to my path, rather than just manually tacking it on the end.

This is on MacOS 10.12.6 and git annex version 7.20190220-g1812ec5da.

Thank you both for your help.
