Sorry, my bug triaging skills are limited. This one happened to have exactly the same error message...

This might again be the wrong thread, but... how does git annex decide which files to ignore? In particular, it seems not always to agree with git:

    $ cd /tmp
    $ mkdir annex
    $ cd annex
    $ git init
    $ git annex init \"Testing annex in /tmp\"
    $ echo \"This file is hidden\" > .hidden_file
    $ git status
    shows .hidden_file as \"untracked\"
    $ git annex add .
    does nothing
    $ git annex add --force .
    does nothing, either
    $ git add .
    adds the file as expected
