The dmg is built by running \"make osxapp\", once you've gotten git-annex to build.

gnutls is only needed by the XMPP code. You can build without that, using `cabal configure -f-XMPP; cabal build`

(If you're building from a git checkout, building w/o XMPP was broken the past couple days; make sure you update to current head.)
