There's now support for creating buckets this way in
my fork, <https://github.com/joeyh/aws>

I have not been able to test it, since I don't have the necessary account,
and don't want to give google my bank account/CC number on top of all the
other info they have gathered, which seems to be needed to sign up for one.

If you check out my fork, `cabal confgure -fExamples; cabal build`
will create a test program in
`dist/build/PutBucketNearLine/PutBucketNearLine` ; it expects the usual
env vars for S3 creds, and you need to pass it the name of the bucket to
create.

If that works, and creates a usable nearline bucket, we can probably get it
merged into mainline aws and then get support in git-annex.
