The GPG cipher algorithm is user configurable (unless annex overrides it) the best way to set it is personal-cipher-preferences. Annex' job is simply to provide enough key material for any viable GPG option (so 256 bits of random data). Also note that GPG's string-to-key \"s2k\" algorithm is an iterated application SHA-1 (also this can be configured). For a quick context, it will use a strength number (for example count=128*1024) and it will hash as many iterations as [count]/[key byte length].
