To make git-annex faster when it's dealing with a lot of urls,
I decided to make it use the http-conduit library for all url access by
default. That way, http pipelining will speed up repeated requests to the
same web servers. This is kind of a follow-up to the recent elimination of
rsync.

Some users rely on some annex.web-options or a .netrc file to configure
how git-annex downloads urls. To keep that supported, when
annex.web-options is set, git-annex will use curl.
To use a .netrc file, curl needs an option, so you would configure:

	git config annex.web-options --netrc

I get the feeling that nobody has implemented resuming interrupted
downloads of files using http-conduit before, because it was unexpectedly
kind of hard and http-types lacks support for some of the necessary
range-related HTTP stuff.

Today's work was supported by the NSF-funded DataLad project.
