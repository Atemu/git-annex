Thanks much for reporting this bug. It turns out that shortly after I
first implemented this, magic-wormhole switched to outputting that text on
stderr, which defeated git-annex's attempt to extract the code phrase.

[[!commit 3dd7f450c1968f8bc2b9cc73c701b1f12f7e326a]] fixes the bug.

Really unfortunate this feature has been broken since almost the beginning.
Especially because pairing with a friend will fail if they have an older
version of git-annex. Added a note about this to the documentation.

Clearly some better testing of this is needed. Testing network stuff like
this is outside the bounds of git-annex's usual test suite, and perhaps it
needs an additional test suite that is allowed to make network connections.
(testremote is allowed to, but needs the remote to be manually set up,
so this is also outside its scope). Opened [[todo/network_test_suite]]
about this.
