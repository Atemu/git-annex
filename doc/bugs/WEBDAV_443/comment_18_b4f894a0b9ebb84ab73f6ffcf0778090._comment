Sorry for the wild tangents.

It is now working. I am not sure what went wrong.

For the record here are the steps I took (all using the Git annex UI):

* Set up removable media -> OK
* Set up remote SSH -> missing lsof -> install it -> everything OK
* Set up S3  -> had issue with time -> solve it with ntp -> everything OK
* Try again WebDav -> \"Conflict\" message -> try using another dir -> everything OK

There might be a \"cleanup after error problem\" somewhere that would explain the conflict message I have received.

Again for the record, I made it works inside a VM using the AUR \"git-annex 4.20130314-1\" (not the standalone). The only change I made on the PKGBUILD was to install everything with cabal except for the packages in the [haskell-core] Arch repo. I know you are not aware with Arch but basically I choose not to rely on the [haskell-web] Arch repo.

I will try again at home on my laptop and I will try the standalone as well.

Thanks you so much for the wonderful product !

Cheers
