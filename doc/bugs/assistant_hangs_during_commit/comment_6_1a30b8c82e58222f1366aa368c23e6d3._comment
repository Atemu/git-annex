Thank you for that investigation. Have you confirmed that --no-edit actually fixes it?  I've made it pass that parameter.

(BTW, the standalone tarball contains a `runshell` script that you use to set up an environment before running git-annex. This includes putting its bundled version of git before the system one in PATH.)
