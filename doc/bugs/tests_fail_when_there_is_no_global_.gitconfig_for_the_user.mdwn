Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: empty ident  <jtang@lenny.localdomain> not allowed

I guess most users testing git-annex probably have a .gitconfig sitting in their home directories already so the above never cropped up. This failure was initially found in a clean and fresh install of a virtual machine with archlinux and repeated again on my archlinux laptop.
