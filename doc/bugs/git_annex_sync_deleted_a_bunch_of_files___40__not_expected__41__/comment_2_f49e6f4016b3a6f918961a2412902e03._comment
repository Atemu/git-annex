Your laptop is in indirect mode, so we know that the only way files can be deleted by a merge is if a commit was made to git that deletes the files.

My conclusion is that some repository, perhaps the usb drive, made a commit that deleted those files. You should be able to find this commit with `git log --stat`, and can just `git revert` it if you want to.

So far, I don't see evidence of a bug. For all I know, you actually did delete the files on the usb drive, and that change got committed..
