* Need to handle retrying downloads of files from glacier after 4 hours.

* When a file is moved into archive/, the assistant that sends it to
  glacier is able to trust that it's in glacier and remove the local copy.
  But other assistants that also have a copy cannot trust that, and so
  don't remove their copies.
