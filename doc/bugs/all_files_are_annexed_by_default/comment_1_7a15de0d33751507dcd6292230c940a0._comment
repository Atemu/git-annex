It's a change in default behavior, but the old default was restored in the more recent versions.   (Detailed discussion [[here|forum/lets_discuss_git_add_behavior]]).  Can you upgrade to the most recent version?  [[install/conda]] lets you install one without being root.  You might also want to set `annex.gitaddtoannex` to `false`.
