Hi,

My Webapp isn't working:
$ git-annex webapp
error: refs/gcrypt/gitception+ does not point to a valid object!
error: refs/remotes/Beta/git-annex does not point to a valid object!
error: refs/remotes/Beta/master does not point to a valid object!
fatal: unable to read tree 656e7db5be172f01c0b6994d01f1a08d1273af12

So I tried to repair it:
$ git-annex repair
Running git fsck ...
Stack space overflow: current size 8388608 bytes.
Use `+RTS -Ksize -RTS' to increase it.

So I tried to follow your advice here and increase the stack:
$ git-annex +RTS -K35000000 -RTS fsck
git-annex: Most RTS options are disabled. Link with -rtsopts to enable them.

I wasn't sure what to do next, so any help would be appreciated.
