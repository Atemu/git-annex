Is there a good reason why `git annex p2p --link` will accept addresses that points to itself?

I'm trying to script automatic addition of .onion peers, and it's a bit annoying to have to filter the .onion pointing to the current repo instead of just adding all of the .onion urls and having it ignore/warn/fail on the one that is currently in .git/annex/creds/p2paddrs
