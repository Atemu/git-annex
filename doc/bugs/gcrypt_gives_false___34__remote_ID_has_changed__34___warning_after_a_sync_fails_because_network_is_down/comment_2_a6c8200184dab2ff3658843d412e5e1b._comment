I am not aware of any problems other than the noise, but I think it's significant noise because it's marked with 'WARNING' in block capitals and this makes the user worry that something might have gone wrong with their precious git-annex data, and there's no indication it can be automatically recovered from.

Would you accept a patch to your fork of git-remote-gcrypt, since the original author is inactive?
