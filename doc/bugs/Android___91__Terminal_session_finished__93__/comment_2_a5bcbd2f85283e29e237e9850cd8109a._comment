When I run that, I get:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
/system/bin/sh: /data/data/ga.androidterm/lib/lib.start.so: not found
\"\"\"]]

Which makes some sense, as the file is not there. The following files can be found under /data/data/ga.androidterm:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
/data/data/ga.androidterm/cache/com.android.renderscript.cache/ <- empty directory
/data/data/ga.androidterm/lib/libga-androidterm4.so
/data/data/ga.androidterm/shared_prefs/ga.androidterm_preferences.xml
\"\"\"]]

I tried running libga-androidterm4.so, but I just got Segmentation fault back.

I also tried using logcat to see if I could see anything obvious going wrong when running the app for the first time after installation, but I could not see anything obvious in the logs (there was a lot of noise, so I might of missed something), will anything useful appear with the use of a filter?
