Ok. I don't what happend, but it's working now. I restart gpg-agent a few times with the script found [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPG#gpg-agent). And now it doesn't ask for any passphrase.

Par contre, I need to export the AWS_* variables if I reboot my pc. I think is because I didn't set embedcreds=yes when initremote. Can I change it now? O I have to remote rm and initremote again?

Thank you,
Juan
