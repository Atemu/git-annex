Like git, git-annex tries to be character set agnostic when it comes to
filenames, including key filenames.

It's certianly possible for a key to contain non-ascii bytes in its name,
and an extension containing unicode or some other non-ascii value is one
way that can in fact happen.

(Looks like, in a C locale, ".ext√º" is 5 chars long, so is considered too
long to be an extension, while in a unicode locale, it's 4 chars long, so
is treated as an extension.)
