Someone in the forum noticed that `git annex wanted`
handles preferred content settings, but there is no analagous `git annex
required`.

Probably worth adding that, although required content is not an often 
used feature, and vicfg can already configure it.

(I don't much like the `git annex required` name. Nor the `git annex wanted`
one when it comes to that. Oh well.)
