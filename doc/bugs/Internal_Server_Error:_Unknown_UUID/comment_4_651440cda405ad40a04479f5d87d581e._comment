I get the problem while only adding an SSH remote. After deciding I want a git-repo on my server, it says \"Unknown UUID\" and created a remote with no name. I was unable to add any SSH remote (tried with two different servers and a couple different dirs - some completly unknown to my annex)

I used the Android webapp btw - latest Version. The same version works fine on my Debian maschines.
