For workflow 6 (\"Manual management of git history without the synchronizer\"), how can files be synchronized across repositories?

Do you still need the workflow of adding remotes and using `git annex get --from=<remote-name>`?

Is it possible to do some variant of `git annex get --from=</path/to/repo>`? How about `git annex get --from=<UUID>`? (And if so, side question: what's the best way to get a repo's UUID?)

Is it possible to transfer files between repos without explicitly creating remotes? If so, how? Are there gotchas when moving files \"by hand\" like permissions to be set?

Thanks!
