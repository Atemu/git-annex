git-annex 3.20111203 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * The VFAT filesystem on recent versions of Linux, when mounted with
     shortname=mixed, does not get along well with git-annex's mixed case
     .git/annex/objects hash directories. To avoid this problem, new content
     is now stored in all-lowercase hash directories. Except for non-bare
     repositories which would be a pain to transition and cannot be put on FAT.
     (Old mixed-case hash directories are still tried for backwards
     compatibility.)
   * Flush json output, avoiding a buffering problem that could result in
     doubled output.
   * Avoid needing haskell98 and other fixes for new ghc. Thanks, Mark Wright.
   * Bugfix: dropunused did not drop keys with two spaces in their name.
   * Support for storing .git/annex on a different device than the rest of the
     git repository.
   * --inbackend can be used to make git-annex only operate on files
     whose content is stored using a specified key-value backend.
   * dead: A command which says that a repository is gone for good
     and you don't want git-annex to mention it again."""]]
