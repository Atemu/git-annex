What steps will reproduce the problem?

Attempt to create an S3 repository called 'S3 (encrypted)' via the web app.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected to either accept this input, or tell me that it's invalid. Instead, I see:

Internal Server Error
user error (openTCPConnection: host lookup failure for "S3 (encrypted)-610526e6-5ce2-11e2-997e-970cbca93f19.s3.amazonaws.com")

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20130107 On Fedora 17 (64-bit).

Please provide any additional information below.
