Leonardo, you made me boot up my windows machine just to check if cygwin git truncated files at the colon. It does not.

AFAIK, Cygwin transliterates colons to another unicode character or something like that. I would be highly surprised if the Cygwin people consider this feature to be a bug.

Since you need Cygwin to build git-annex on Windows anyway (though not to run it!), this remains WONTFIX.
