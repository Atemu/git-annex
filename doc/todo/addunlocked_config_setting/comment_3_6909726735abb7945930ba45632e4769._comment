Retargeting this todo at something useful post-git-add-kerfluffle,
annex.addunlocked could usefully be a pagespec to allow adding some files
unlocked and others locked (by git-annex add only, not git add).
"true" would be the same as "anything" and false as "nothing".

---

It may also then make sense to let it be configured in .gitattributes.
Although, the ugliness of setting a pagespec in .gitattributes,
as was done for annex.largefiles, coupled with the overhead of needing to
query that from git-check-attr for every file, makes me wary.

(Surprising amount of `git-annex add` time is in querying the
annex.largefiles and annex.backend attributes. Setting the former in
gitconfig avoids the attribute query and speeds up add of smaller files by
2%. Granted I've sped up add (except hashing) by probably 20% this month,
and with large files the hashing dominates.)

The query overhead could maybe be finessed: Since adding a file
already queries gitattributes for two other things, a single query could be
done for a file and the result cached.

Letting it be globally configured via `git-annex config` is an alternative
that I'm leaning toward.
(That would also need some caching, easier to implement and faster
since it is not a per-file value as the gitattribute would be.)
