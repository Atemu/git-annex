This has merge conflict potential, because the key generated by import
--fast is probably not be the same one generated by a regular import. So, if
two repositories are both importing from the same special remote, there will be
a need to resolve the resulting merge conflicts.

Since git-annex sync is often run with and without --content, it's probably
the most likely problem point for this. Perhaps there should be another
config that controls whether sync does a fast import or not, and not
control it with --content?
