Due to popular demand, git-annex can now be used with bare repositories.

So, for example, you can stash a file away in the origin:
`git annex move mybigfile --to origin`

Of course, for that to work, the bare repository has to be on a system with
[[git-annex-shell]] installed. If "origin" is on GitWeb, you still can't
use git-annex to store stuff there.

It took a while, but bare repositories are now supported exactly as well
as non-bare repositories. Except for these caveats:

* `git annex fsck` works in a bare repository, but does not display
  warnings about insufficient
  [[copies]]. To get those warnings, just run it in one of the non-bare
  checkouts.
* `git annex unused` in a bare repository only knows about keys used in
  branches that have been pushed to the bare repository. So use it with care..
* Commands that need a work tree, like `git annex add` won't work in a bare
  repository, of course.
