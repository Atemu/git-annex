### Please describe the problem.

Git-annex-uninit leaves the underlying git-repo in an unusable state because it does not revert whatever modifications the current git-annex version does to git-add.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git init Test
    cd Test
    touch test1.txt; git add test1.txt; git commit -m "initial commit"
    git annex init
    git annex uninit
    touch test2.txt
    git add test2.txt

The last command fails with:

    git-annex: First run: git-annex init
    error: external filter 'git-annex smudge --clean -- %f' failed 1
    error: external filter 'git-annex smudge --clean -- %f' failed``

### Please provide any additional information below.

I accidentally discovered this after a system upgrade that included the latest version of git-annex. I wasn't aware of git-add's new behaviour, and so my workflow suddenly failed silently: I was used to manually using git-annex for big files, but from day to day, I just used git normally and synced my workstations through a remote that didn't have git-annex. Now the content of my new files didn't propagate any more; I was mystified, since the files that didn't propagate looked normal (they weren't symlinks, as I was used to for annexed files, and at first I couldn't figure out how to know whether they were annexed or not). As I was in a rush and didn't have access to the internet to clear things up, I kind of panicked and tried getting rid of git-annex before it did more damageâ€¦

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I love git-annex (a brilliantly designed piece of software in my view) and have been using it a lot for years!
