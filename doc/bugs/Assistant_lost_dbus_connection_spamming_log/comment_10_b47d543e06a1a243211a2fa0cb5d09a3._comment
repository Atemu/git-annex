I've found the 1 second delay on failure to accept in the warp source code.

It's using Network.Socket.accept, which uses accept4 with NONBLOCK by default, but can be built without `HAVE_ACCEPT4` and in that case uses `accept` with blocking.

I've put in a patch to build network without accept4 support, and am rebuilding the arm autobuilder. This will take a while..
