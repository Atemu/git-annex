### Please describe the problem.

Google's Nearline Storage does not work with git-annex.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Create a remote on google cloud storage. AFAIK there is no way to tell annex to create a nearline bucket so what I did was to let it create a regular bucket. At this point everything works I can store retrieve files from the remote. Then I download the buckets content delete the bucket and recreate a nearline bucket with the same name as the old one and re-upload the content. With the new nearline bucket trying to put files there results in a 400 bad request error.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Mac OS X, git-annex version: 5.20150219-g52daae5
