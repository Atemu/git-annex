SHA512 backend has 128 bytes key name, that's where I got that suggestion
from. Some filesystems have limits around 255 bytes for the name of a file,
so that leaves plenty for extension, and the rest of the parts of the key.
Realistically, the length of a SHA256 is a better goal.

Of course, if you had a crazy 1025 byte hash and wanted to use it on IDK,
GNU Hurd or something, you could do it, but your repo
would not be portable to eg Linux with its 1024 byte filename limit.
git-annex itself does not care though, and I *think* git would also not
care.
