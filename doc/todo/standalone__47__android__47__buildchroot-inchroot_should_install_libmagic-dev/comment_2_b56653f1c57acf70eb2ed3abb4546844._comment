My android builds include neither magic nor concurrent-output (which is
what's using terminal-size). I don't feel it's worth trying to get
these features working on androd.

So, I've adjusted install-haskell-packages to disable the flags.

If you are interested in working on the android port, I'd be very excited
for any help. As you can see, there is much room for improvement in the
build system for it. (It would be nice to rework it to use stack, rather
than the current approach, and using stack would automatically disable
these flags that are not portable.) And of course, there are many other
parts of the android port that need improvement.
