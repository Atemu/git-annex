So your nfs filesystem is making a posix lock operation block for 2 minutes
before, I suppose, it makes it fail.

Since git-annex has to do a posix lock operation, the only way to make it
faster would be to fix the nfs filesystem to not do that. Perhaps by disabling
posix locking altogether since it's apparently broken.

But as far as what git-annex can do, I don't see any possible way to speed it up.

I agree it could make sense to display a message, although that will also
be a message the vast majority of users who are not in this situation would
see. Maybe it could wait 1-10 seconds (probably 1000 times as long as it
will take in most situations) and if the probe is still ongoing, display a
message.
