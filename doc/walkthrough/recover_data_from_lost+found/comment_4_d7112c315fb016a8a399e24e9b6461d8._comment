Hmm. Old versions may have forgotten to git add a .git-annex location log file when recovering content with fsck. That could be another reason things are out of sync.

But I'm not clear on which repo is trying to copy files to which.

(NB: If the files were recovered on a bare git repo, fsck cannot update the location log there, which could also explain this.)
