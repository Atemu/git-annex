I have three machines with the same repository in all of the machines.
  
  - cat-laptop:~/personal
  - dog:~/personal
  - turtle:~/personal
 
All of them are connected to each other in `client mode`, and were
paired via the `Assistant` as `Local Computers`.

`dog:~/personal` is accessible through the LAN and externally to the
internet.

Will there be a problem if I add `dog:~/personal` as a `Remote Server`
through the assistant  with a different hostname and port to
`cat-laptop:~/personal`? And does git-annex know what remote to use if
`cat-laptop` is connected to the same LAN as `dog`?

My  worries are file collisions, missing commits, or any lose of
updates because of one repository treated as multiple remotes in other
client repositories.
