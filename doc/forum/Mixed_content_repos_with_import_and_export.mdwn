Is it possible to get mixed content repositories working in conjunction with a directory special remote using importtree/exporttree?

`git annex add` adheres to the `annex.largefiles` setting (`mimetype=text/*`), but importing or syncing from the remote invariably adds text files to the annex, including if the file was originally added to git and then modified on the remote.

I want `annex.synccontent` set to `true` but have tried it both ways.

What am I missing?
