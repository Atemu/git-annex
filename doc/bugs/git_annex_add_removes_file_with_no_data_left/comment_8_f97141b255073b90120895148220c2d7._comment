Ok, it is in fact relevant that the file is a tarball of a git-annex repository, because git-annex add turns out to be looking at the beginning of the file, and seeing that it contains a git-annex link.

I thought that code was only supposed to fire in repos on FAT filesystems that don't have symlinks. So, several issues to fix here, it seems..
