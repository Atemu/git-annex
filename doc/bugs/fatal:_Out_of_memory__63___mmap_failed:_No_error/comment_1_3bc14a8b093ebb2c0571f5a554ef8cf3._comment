That error message is a git error message (from git's `wrapper.c`), not a git-annex error message.

It's quite possible that git does not scale to as many file on Windows as it does on Unix, and git is known to not scale particularly well to vast numbers of files even on unix, although running out of memory is not the typical failure mode there.

I think you should file a bug report on git.
