As I found the latest comment confusing, here's the full quote:

    Depending on the size of the data you are uploading, Amazon S3 offers the following options:
    
    Upload objects in a single operation—With a single PUT operation you can upload objects up to 5 GB in size.
    
    Upload objects in parts—Using the Multipart upload API you can upload large objects, up to 5 TB.
    
    The Multipart Upload API is designed to improve the upload experience for larger objects. You can upload objects in parts.
    These object parts can be uploaded independently, in any order, and in parallel.
    You can use a Multipart Upload for objects from 5 MB to 5 TB in size.
    
    We encourage Amazon S3 customers to use Multipart Upload for objects greater than 100 MB.
