You can `cabal configure -fEKG` to build a git-annex that includes
the EKG remote monitoring interface.

To access the EKG control panel, go to
<http://localhost:4242/> while a git-annex command is running.

This EKG build is mostly useful for debugging resource usage problems.

Note that since only one process can open port 4242 at a time, running
more than one git-annex process with EKG support at the same time can
result in some "resource busy (Address already in use)" messages -- but
git-annex will continue to work.
