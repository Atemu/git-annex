I've converted everything to withCreateProcess, except for process pools
(P2P.IO, Assistant.TransferrerPool, Utility.CoProcess, and Remote.External),
which need to be handled as discussed in comment 8.

During this conversion, I did not watch out for interactive processes that
might block on a password, so any timeout would also affect them. Really,
I don't see a good way to avoid that. Any ssh may or may not need a
password. I guess timeouts will need to affect things stuck on passwords
too, which argues for no default timeout, but otherwise is probably ok
as long as timeouts can be configured on a per-remote basis.
