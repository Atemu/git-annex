Make `git-annex add --force-large` and `git-annex add --force-small` 
add a specific file to annex or git, bypassing annex.largefiles
and all other configuration and state.

One reason to want this is that it avoids users doing stuff like this:

	git -c annex.largefiles=anything annex add foo.c

Such a temporary setting of annex.largefiles can be problimatic, as explored in 
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/A_case_where_file_tracked_by_git_unexpectedly_becomes_annex_pointer_file/>

Also, this could also be used to easily switch a file from one storage to
the other. I suppose the file would have to be touched first to make git-annex
add process it?
