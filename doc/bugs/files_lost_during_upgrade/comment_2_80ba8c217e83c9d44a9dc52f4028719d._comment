Looking back at this bug, it's clearly the same race that I later
debugged and fixed in [[bad_merge_commit_deleting_all_files]]. There are instructions in that bug for recovering it.

In particular, the \"fatal: Could not switch to '/home/jwiklund/Documents/.git/annex/merge/': No such file or directory\" is because of the race; the merge directory is being created and deleted by two contending threads.
