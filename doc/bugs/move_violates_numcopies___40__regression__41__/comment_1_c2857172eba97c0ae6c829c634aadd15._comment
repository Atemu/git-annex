I can trigger this on my end.

With the script below, it bisects [*] to 0133b7e5a (move: Improve
resuming a move that was interrupted after the object was transferred,
2020-10-21), which was included in the 8.20201103 release.

  [*] Well, almost.  I couldn't build the two commits right before
      0133b7e5a (363acfb55 and 62d630272).

[[!format sh \"\"\"
cd \"$(mktemp -d \"${TMPDIR:-/tmp}\"/gx-XXXXXXX)\" || exit 125
git annex version
git init a
(
    cd a
    echo one >one
    git annex init a
    git annex add one
    git commit -mone
)
git clone -o a a b
(
    cd b
    git annex init b
    git annex get one
    git annex numcopies 2
    git annex numcopies
    git annex whereis
)
git -C b annex move --to=a one || exit 0
exit 1
