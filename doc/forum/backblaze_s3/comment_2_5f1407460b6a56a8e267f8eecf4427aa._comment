I rebuilt git-annex with the new signature v4 patch and I got it to work.

I had to create a new application key that wasn't tied to a bucket or else I would get an 'access denied' error. I didn't set any prefix on the files uploaded.

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=keyID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=applicationKey git-annex initremote backblaze type=S3 host=S3-endpoint bucket=bucketID protocol=https signature=v4

This created a new bucket with the same bucketID as the one I previously created and intended to use, and with the name equal to the bucketID

I suspect if I had done bucket=bucketName and not bucketID I could've used a bucket specific key but now that it's set up it's not worth it to me to try to change it.
