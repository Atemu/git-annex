When you add the box.com repo on the desktop, it will show up on Android pretty quickly thanks to XMPP syncing. But this does not cause the repository to be enabled to be used on Android. You need to select it and enable it there.

I can see this is the case thanks to the log you posted. The Android is constantly complaining:

> XMPPSendPack: Unable to download files from your other devices.

This message should also be appearing in an alert message in the sidebar of the webapp.
