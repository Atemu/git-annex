The error message is git-annex trying to access a "dx://" url, which is not
allowed by the default configuration. (Also which git-annex would have no
idea how to access even if it were allowed.)

Setting readonly=true for a special remote prevents using the external 
special remote program at all, which would presumably do something that
worked better if it ran.

This might be a bug in the special remote you're using, if its
documentation suggests it will work in readonly mode and it only registers
these "dx://" urls that can't work in readonly mode.

Did you set remote.name.annex-readonly manually, or did you run
git annex enableremote with readonly=true? Only the latter is documented to
disable use of the special remote program, which could be considered a
documentation bug in git-annex. That's the only potential git-annex bug I'm
seeing here.
