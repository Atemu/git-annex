I've been revisiting the XMPP stuff this week, and today I fixed at least 3 problems that would keep XMPP sync from happening reliably. This would affect machines that are using XMPP and are sometimes disconnected from the net (or suspended). Nothing caused a sync to happen when restarting the assistant, or resuming from a network disconnection. This could result in both files not showing up, and file contents not being transferred, depending on the case hit.

I think it explains everything in this bug report, hopefully.
