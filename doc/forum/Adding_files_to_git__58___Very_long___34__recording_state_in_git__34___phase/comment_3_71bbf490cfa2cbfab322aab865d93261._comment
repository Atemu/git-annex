Reading up more on the issue (the page you linked and some other pages regarding the way smudge/clean filters affect performance), I'm still not sure I understand the exact issue for this case.  When adding a lot of files to the annex directly, there's no issue.  Am I understanding the smudge/clean filter performance issues incorrectly?  When the `largefiles` option is used and files are added to git (instead of annex), what does the smudge filter do to the file or its contents that requires extra time?  I guess I'm not clear on what exactly happens when a file is excluded from a `largefiles` filter that takes longer than adding a file to git-annex.  I would have expected the opposite to be true.
