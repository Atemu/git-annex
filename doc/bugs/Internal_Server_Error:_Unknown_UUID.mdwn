### Please describe the problem.

One of my repositories has no name:
http://screencast.com/t/3OjxFzpz

And when I try to disable it I get this error:

    Internal Server Error
    Unknown UUID

When I try to delete it I get this error:

    Internal Server Error
    unknown UUID; cannot modify

I think this was the result of adding a Local Computer Repo, and then that computer signed off.  Maybe.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version 4.20130601-g2b6c3f2
Mac OS 10.7.5

### Please provide any additional information below.

Maybe it's a glitch that only will happen this once, the problem is I can't get rid of it!  Are there anyways of manually getting rid of a repo with uid?
