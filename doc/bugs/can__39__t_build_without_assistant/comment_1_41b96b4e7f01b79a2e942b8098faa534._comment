Thanks for the patch, but while it is moving in a good direction,
it gets some things wrong too. Problems I noticed:

* It removes the "&& ! os(solaris) && ! os(gnu)" from the assistant flag
  test, which are important to support building git-annex on hurd and
  solaris.
* Utility.Android is used inside *linux* builds to detect android at
  runtime. So moving it under the flag(Android) test is wrong and will
  break all linux builds AFAICS.
* Build.DesktopFile is not linked into the assistant, like Build.Configure
  it's only listed to get the source file into the cabal tarball. Best to
  keep it with the other such files.

I've applied the patch but reverted the above changes.
