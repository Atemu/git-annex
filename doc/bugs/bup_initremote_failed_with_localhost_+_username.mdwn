### Please describe the problem.
Attempted to create a bup remote on the current system via ssh. It appears to have created the bup remote fine, but fails when sshing to it and does not add the remote.
This is a normal indirect annex (currently containing a single test jpg in its root)
I'm presuming the error is "(storing uuid...) sh: 1: cd: can't cd to /~/archie" 


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
git annex initremote bup type=bup encryption=none buprepo=sshservername:path

I've tried using .ssh/config to remove the username from the servername passed to bup repo and it still fails.
