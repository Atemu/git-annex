If you write up a [[tip|tips]] documenting how to manually set one up
(nix specific would be fine), then it might make sense to simplify that
documentation with a command like:

	git-annex-enable-tor --already-configured --onion-address=... --hidden-service-port=...

To avoid needing to manually write data into .git/annex/

I think that and documentation is all that's needed, and that command
on its own is not very useful w/o documentation of the full manual setup,
which is why I suggest you write the documentation first.
