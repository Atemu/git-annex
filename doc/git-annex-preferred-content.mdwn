# NAME

git-annex-preferred-content - 

# DESCRIPTION

Each repository has a preferred content setting, which specifies content
that the repository wants to have present. These settings can be configured
using `git annex vicfg` or `git annex wanted`.
They are used by the `--auto` option, by `git annex sync --content`,
and by the git-annex assistant.

Preferred content expressions are similar, but not identical to
the [[git-annex-matching-options]](1), just without the dashes.
For example:

	exclude=archive/* and (include=*.mp3 or smallerthan=1mb)

The main differences are that `exclude=` and `include=` always
match relative to the top of the git repository, and that there is
no equivilant to `--in`.

For more details about preferred content expressions, see
See <https://git-annex.branchable.com/preferred_content/>

When a repository is in one of the standard predefined groups, like "backup"
and "client", setting its preferred content to "standard" will use a
built-in preferred content expression developed for that group. 
See <https://git-annex.branchable.com/preferred_content/standard_groups/>

If you have set a groupwanted expression for a group, it will be used
when a repository in the group has its preferred content set to
"groupwanted".
