[Due to some stupid issue on my and AT&T's part] one of my remote repositories is currently unreachable. I would like to tell the webapp/assistant to not attempt to sync with it, or, at least, modify this error message to be more specific (by telling me which repository is unreachable).

In a red bubble it says: "Synced with rose 60justin"

That verbage is the same if they all succeed. The only difference is the red instead of green. Would be nice to know exactly which machine to kick (if I didn't already know, eg I was syncing only with repositories not under my control).
