### Please describe the problem.

I am using annex with a gcrypt encrypted repository but I am not able to sync content to the remote share via Webapp. If I sync via command line everything is working as expected but via Webapp I receive several error messages complaining about tty not available.

As I workaround I changed two things:

1. /usr/local/bin/git-remote-gcrypt: As $GPG_AGENT_INFO was not set I needed to include "--no-tty" on line 377
2. Add a line in ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf with option "no-tty"

As this breaks gpg2 for use on command line I wanted to provide the --no-tty via option **annex.gnupg-options** as mentioned in the manual. Not sure what I am doing wrong but the Webapp does not pick up these options.

```
[annex]
	gnupg-options = --no-tty
```


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Create repository via

```sh
git annex initremote hidrive type=gcrypt gitrepo=rsync.hidrive.strato.com:/users/xxxxxx/hidrive.git chunk=5MiB keyid=XXXXXXXX
```
Launch Webapp

```sh
git annex webapp
```

Copy files to local annex directory

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
