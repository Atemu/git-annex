    Standalone package from NeuroDebian is not affected. 
    Hirsute package is not affected. 
    Groovy package is not affected. 
    Focal package is affected.

As it looks like this was fixed between focal and groovy, it would be great to pinpoint a particular commit so it can be backported to the Ubuntu LTS.
