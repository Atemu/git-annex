This is strange: I can replicate the problem on three different Ubuntu machines (12.04.5 32 and 64 bit, 14.04 64 bit) using that script.

I attached to the gist [the execution log in direct mode](https://gist.github.com/gioele/dde462df89edfe17c5e3#file-annex-direct-log) (where the bug is shown), the [log in indirect mode](https://gist.github.com/gioele/dde462df89edfe17c5e3#file-annex-indirect-log) (where the bug does not appear), and a [diff between the two](https://gist.github.com/gioele/dde462df89edfe17c5e3#file-log-diff). I hope this helps.
