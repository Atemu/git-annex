The manpage for [[git-annex-preferred-content]] says "While --include=glob and --exclude=glob match files relative to the current directory, preferred content expressions match files relative to the top of the git repository".  Is the "While..." part referring to [[git-annex-matching-options]], as contrasted with [[git-annex-preferred-content]]?
