{- Watches for changes to files in a directory, and all its subdirectories,
 - using inotify. This function returns after its initial setup is
 - complete, leaving a thread running. Then callbacks are made for adding
 - and deleting files.
 -
 - Inotify is weak at recursive directory watching; the whole directory
 - tree must be walked and watches set explicitly for each subdirectory.
 -
 - To notice newly created subdirectories, inotify is used, and
 - watches are registered for those directories. There is a race there;
 - things can be added to a directory before the watch gets registered.
 -
 - To close the inotify race, each time a new directory is found, it also 
 - recursively scans it, assuming all files in it were just added,
 - and registering each subdirectory.
 -
 - Note: Due to the race amelioration, multiple add events may occur
 - for the same file.
 - 
 - Note: Moving a file may involve deleting it from its old location and
 - adding it to the new location. 
 - 
 - Note: Modification of files is not detected, and it's assumed that when
 - a file that was open for write is closed, it's done being written
 - to, and can be added.
 -
 - Note: inotify has a limit to the number of watches allowed,
 - /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches (default 8192).
 - So This will fail if there are too many subdirectories.
