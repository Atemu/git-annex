> until v6 becomes the default

default only for the crippled FS or for all?

Anyways, it is up to you of cause.  But even with your use-case (when to prefer direct instead of v6) it sounds like such an option would be handy so I could set it within ~/.gitconfig and have all new repos uniformly in `direct` mode (whenever v6 is the default).  Especially since `annex init` seems to have no option for getting into direct mode right away, so whenever v6 becomes default there, it would require a jump first into v6 and then running `annex direct` (if I am not missing anything).
