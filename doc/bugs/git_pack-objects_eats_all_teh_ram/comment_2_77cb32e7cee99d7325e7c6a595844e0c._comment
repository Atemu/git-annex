git-annex never directly calls `git pack-object` or `git repack`
or anything like that. This is likely being done internally by git,
as controlled by `gc.auto` configuration.

If this is eating a lot of ram, it seems to me that you have likely
checked some large files into you git repository, rather than using
git-annex to manange them. git using lots of ram when large
files have been added to it is one of the reasons git-annex exists,
after all..
