Reproduced by running `cabal unpack git-annex`. While the tarball on
hackage does have execute bits, somehow cabal is not preserving them.
Applied your patch, thanks.

Cabal's ability to install anything more than a command into PATH is very
limited, and also there's not really a good way to install man pages
in a user's home directory in a way that will make man find them (ie,
there's probably one way or less per OS, and all different). 
So it's best to use the Makefile (from a git clone of the repo)
if you want to install git-annex in a more complete manner, 
ie system wide or generating a package of its files.
