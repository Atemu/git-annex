The git-annex assistant is being
[crowd funded on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyh/git-annex-assistant-like-dropbox-but-with-your-own/).

This is my design and plan for developing it.
Still being fleshed out, still many ideas and use cases to add.
Feel free to chip in with comments! --[[Joey]]
