Thank you for the explanation.  It certainly explains your situation back when you coded this up.  I'm not sure I'm convinced it is good justification to keep things the way they are going forward.

1. The branch names aren't short
2. The branch names aren't clash-free (see my other report)
3. I switch between branches all the time, that's their purpose.

For #3, I usually rely on either mark-copy'ing the characters off the terminal with the mouse or via bash-completion.  Both are broken.

Isn't it that people aren't using () for branch or filenames precisely because of the problems you will almost certainly run into?
