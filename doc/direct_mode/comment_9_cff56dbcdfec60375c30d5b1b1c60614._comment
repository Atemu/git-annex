I'd like to have an indirect mode repo on my laptop cloned on a cifs mount point (mounted off an SMB NAS) thus in direct mode. But all I can see on the clone after merge/pull is text files of length 207 chars containg the symlink in plain text.

I guess this is what git manages internally for the symlinks... so I'm afraid git annex doesn't work in such case.

Can you confirm that indirect and direct modes can coexist on clones of the same repo ?
