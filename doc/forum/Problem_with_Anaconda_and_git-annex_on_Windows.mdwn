I have a problem with using git-annex with Anaconda (I'm using Windows 10). I have installed Git (using "conda install -c conda-forge git" under Anaconda prompt) and then git-annex (in the Anaconda3/Library directory, as suggested e.g., here: http://handbook.datalad.org/en/inm7/intro/installation.html#windows-10). However, Anaconda doesn't seem to recognize git-annex at all (for example, running "git annex test" gives the error that "annex" is not a valid git command). At the same time I can run git and git-annex using Windows command line). I'd appreciate any help (is it somehow a problem with installation paths or something deeper?).
