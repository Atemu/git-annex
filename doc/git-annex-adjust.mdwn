# NAME

git-annex adjust - enter an adjusted branch

# SYNOPSIS

git annex adjust `--unlock|--fix|--hide-missing [--unlock|--fix]`

# DESCRIPTION

Enters an adjusted form of the current branch. The annexed files will
be treated differently. For example with --unlock all annexed files will
be unlocked.

The adjusted branch will have a name like "adjusted/master(unlocked)".
Since it's a regular git branch, you can use `git checkout` to switch
back to the original branch at any time.

While in the adjusted branch, you can use git-annex and git commands as
usual. Any commits that you make will initially only be made to the
adjusted branch. 

To propagate commits from the adjusted branch back to the original branch,
and to other repositories, as well as to merge in changes from other
repositories, run `git annex sync`.

Re-running this command with the same options
while inside the adjusted branch will update the adjusted branch
as necessary (eg for `--hide-missing`), and will also propagate commits
back to the original branch.

This command can only be used in a v6 git-annex repository.

# OPTIONS

* `--unlock`

  Unlock all annexed files in the adjusted branch. This allows
  annexed files to be modified.

* `--fix`

  Fix the symlinks to annexed files to point to the local git annex
  object directory. This can be useful if a repository is checked out in an
  unusual way that prevents the symlinks committed to git from pointing at
  the annex objects.

* `--hide-missing`

  Only include annexed files in the adjusted branch when their content
  is present.

  The adjusted branch is not immediately changed when content availability
  changes, so if you `git annex drop` files, they will become broken
  links in the usual way. And when files that were missing are copied into the
  repository from elsewhere, they won't immediatly become visible in the
  branch. 
  
  To update the adjusted branch to reflect changes to content availability, 
  run `git annex adjust --hide-missing` again.

  This option can be combined with --unlock or --fix.
