### Please describe the problem.

I have been packaging bencode as a dependency for git-annex on Debian.

I contacted the upstream authors in reference to getting some licensing issues fixed and they pointed me to a package called "AttoBencode" which
might be a more recent and maintained option for bencode parsing in Git Annex.

This isn't actually a bug, I just thought this would be a good place to bring this up. 

For what it's worth, I like the idea that packages can become stable (or old) and still serve their purpose so if bencode works just fine I think that's great.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.
