The S3 library that git-annex is using does not support the authentication method that this region uses.

It is supported by the aws library that git-annex uses in the `s3-aws` branch in git, and I already added the region there this morning.

I can't merge `s3-aws` yet; the neccessary version of the aws library is not yet available in eg, Debian. And even upgrading aws from cabal seems to result in dependency hell, due to its needing a newer version of scientific. This should all sort itself out in time.

If you need this region, you'll need to try to build git-annex's s3-aws branch, for now.
