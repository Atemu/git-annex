Same use case here.  Hey, I even also use ~/work.

I've burned my fingers on git repositories synched via Dropbox, so I share the reservations against it.  But in my case the trouble came from lack of caution when sharing the given Dropbox folders.  I'm not sure what the risks are when I'm in control of all the copies.  Synching between my own computers should not pose a problem, I know how to create branches for experimental stuff etc.

I'd love to use git-annex is to maintain dispersed repositories while synching and archiving effectively.  The issue with .git directories is a real blocker and I'd really appreciate a workable solution.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but manually invoking submodule or the need to configure lots of remotes is not exactly practical.

I don't know enough to fully understand everything above.  So what follows may be hopelessly naive.  But it occurred to me there may be a simpler solution: what if git-annex changed the name of its repo to .annex (or so) instead of .git?  And maybe similarly .gitignore to .annexignore etc.  Wouldn't the nested git repositories then \"just work\"?  Because of the hardcoded ignore rules, this approach would require a tweaked git for annex... but overall, wouldn't it be cleaner and more minimal?

I'm probably overlooking something, but maybe this idea can lead somewhere?
