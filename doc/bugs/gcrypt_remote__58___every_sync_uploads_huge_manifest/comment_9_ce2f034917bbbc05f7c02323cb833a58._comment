You can just change the url of the remote in .git/config. And `git-annex
enableremote` can be used to change the gitrepo parameter stored there.

But, git-annex will not be able to use the remote once you switch it to
rsync, since it does not yet support gcrypt over rsync. That is what this
bug report is open waiting to be implemented.
