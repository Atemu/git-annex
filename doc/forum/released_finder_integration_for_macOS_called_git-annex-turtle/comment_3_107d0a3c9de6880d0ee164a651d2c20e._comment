wow, that is absolutely gorgeous. i wish we had the same in linux! it would make git-annex so much simpler to use... but i don't know if contrib plugins can add graphic stuff like that in file manager displays in nautilus/etc?

seems like we're clearly lagging behind when I look at the finder... can't believe we still don't have a proper file manager in linux yet... --[[anarcat]]
