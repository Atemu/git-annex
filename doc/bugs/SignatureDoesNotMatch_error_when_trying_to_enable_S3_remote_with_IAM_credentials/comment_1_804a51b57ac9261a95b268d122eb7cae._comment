Does the S3musicencrypted special remote have embedcreds=yes set 
in its configuration? You could look at `git show git-annex:remote.log`
to check. (Don't paste it here, may contain access keys.)

Does `.git/annex/creds/a7e22956-5ce2-11e2-97a5-6f33220ffbf3` exist?

Based on looking at the code, I'd expect environment variables to override
both of those, so I wonder if perhaps the creds you passed in the
environment are just wrong.
