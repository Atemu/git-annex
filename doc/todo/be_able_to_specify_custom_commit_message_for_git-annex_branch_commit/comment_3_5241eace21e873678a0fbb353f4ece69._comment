There are a few other messages than "update" that show up in some rare
occasions including (message ++ " (recovery from race #"..) and
"new branch for transition".

And, there's "merging remote/git-annex into git-annex"
which is common enough.

I kind of have the feeling that the rare ones are rare enough
that we might want to always use them, and only override 
merging and update.
