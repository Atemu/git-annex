Glad you recovered ok.

It sounds like windows may be doing something horrible with case
insensitivity in the file system. It's normal for .git/annex/objects/
to contain subdirectories with names that only differ by case.

If Windows used to respond to a request for .git/annex/object/XY with
the contents of that, but now instead responds with the contents of the xy
directory, it should be possible to rearrange things so git-annex still
works, but I would not recommend doing it with live data without backups.
