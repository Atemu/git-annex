## Reproduce

 - run `git annex get --from mylinuxbox` on git-annex Android 5.20131213 or 5.20131221
 - `mylinuxbox` is running 5.20131221 standalone

## Expected result

The Android box gets the missing file.

## Actual result

    git-annex: unknown command sendkey

## Workaround

Run 5.20131213 on `mylinuxbox`, which does not have this problem.

## Additional

linux standalone 5.20131213 and 5.20131221 are both able to `get` from linux standalone 5.20131221 -- this only affects the Android version.

*Edit:* On second thought, Android is not the only distinguishing factor. Apart from being Android, the box and repo having trouble have the following distinguishing factors from the ones I tried that worked:

 - Android
 - Direct mode
 - Remote was set up by the Assistant
