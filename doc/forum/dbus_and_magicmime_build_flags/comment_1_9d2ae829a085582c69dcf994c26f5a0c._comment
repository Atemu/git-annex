(Argh, this question fell into my backlog unnoticed!)

These build flags depend on C libraries and stack can't install C libraries
so enabling them would make the stack build not succeed on all systems.
The build does #warn about features that are not enabled when building with
the flags turned off.

If you're able to install libdbus and libmagic, you should, and turn the
build flags on.
