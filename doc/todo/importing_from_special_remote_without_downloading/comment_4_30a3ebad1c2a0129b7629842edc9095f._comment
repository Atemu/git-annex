Thanks -- this would solve (among other things) [[bugs/removeLink_failed_when_initializing_a_repo_in_a_VirtualBox_shared_folder]]: I could put the git-annex repo on the normal filesystem inside the VM, and only the directory special remote would then deal with the broken vboxsf filesystem.  import-tree *with* copying isn't possible as the files are too big.
