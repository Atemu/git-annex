Does the .git/index.lock file still exist now that git-annex has exited?

Can you provide a log with --debug of the git-annex add command?
Can trim it to only the lines containing xargs.

I am pretty sure git-annex only runs one git add at a time, no matter how
many jobs you configure. It seems quite likely that some other git command
was operating in the repository at the same time and locked the index,
or like the error message says, git may have somehow crashed and left
the index.lock behind.
