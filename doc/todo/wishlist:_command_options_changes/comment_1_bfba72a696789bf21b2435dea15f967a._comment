--to and --from seem to have different semantics than --source and --destination. Subtle, but still different.

That being said, I am not sure --from and --to are needed at all. Calling the local repo . and all remotes by their name, they are arguably redundant and removing them would make the syntax a lot prettier; mv and cp don't need them, either.

I am not sure changing syntax at this point is considered good style though personally, I wouldn't mind adapting and would actually prefer it over using --to and --from.

-v and -q would be nice.
