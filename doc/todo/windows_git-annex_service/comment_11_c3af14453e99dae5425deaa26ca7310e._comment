Hey, just tried git-annex on windows. Love the idea, but the windows port still seems to be a work in progress. I thought I'd check in here and see if i could help. Maybe this is a start:

You can setup any executable file as a windows service using Sc.exe included in the Windows Resource Kit.

Its pretty easy and straightforward 

Another option would be installing the service using nsis, here is one possible plugin that should do the trick: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/NSIS_Simple_Service_Plugin
