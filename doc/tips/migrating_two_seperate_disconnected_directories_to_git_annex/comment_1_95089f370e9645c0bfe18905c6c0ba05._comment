I recently started an attempt to migrate multiple existing directories to git annex. The [[walkthrough]] section on adding remotes gave me the impression that it was as simple as initializing a git annex on each copy and then just syncing them all up! The big surprise came when I attempted the sync and git complained about conflicts that it was attempting to merge. I had missed the most important point that these are all in fact git repositories, and you can't just fetch random unrelated git repositories into each other!

This particular tip can save so much pain for newcomers like me, if only the walkthrough pointed out this situation.
