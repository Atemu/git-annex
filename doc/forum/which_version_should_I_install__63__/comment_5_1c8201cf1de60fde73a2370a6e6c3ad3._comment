thank you again for being so helpful:

I was using an old lts ubuntu, but the repos only had git-annex v6, and install from source wasn't working, so I upgraded to... ubuntu 19.10 / eoan, and it looks like http://neuro.debian.net/ doesn't yet support that release. 

I don't exactly love polluting my apt sources, but I can be compelled to if that's my best / only option.

I'll keep digging, if I can find a prebuilt .deb, I'll likely use that. (too bad there isn't a snap?)
