I don't think that implicit installation to /usr/local/bin just because
runshell was run as root makes sense, no. If root wants to install
git-annex system-wide they have plenty of good options, but the standalone
tarball is not really one of them.

Another reason to keep the git-annex-shell wrapper in ~/.ssh is because the
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file that the assistant installs will refer to that
wrapper. So it makes sense to keep all that related stuff together IMHO.
