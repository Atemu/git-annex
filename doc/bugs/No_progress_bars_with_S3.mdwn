## What steps will reproduce the problem?

Add new data to a repository with an S3 special remote. Monitor the repository with the web app.


## What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect a changing status bar and percentage. Instead I see no changes when an upload becomes active.


## What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20130102 on Arch 64-bit.


## Please provide any additional information below.


When uploading local data to an S3 remote, I see no progress bars. The progress bar area on active uploads stays the same grey as the bar on queued uploads. The status does not change from "0% of...". The uploads are completing, but this makes it very difficult to judge their activity.

The only remotes I currently have setup are S3 special remotes, so I cannot say whether progress bars are working for uploads to other remote types.
