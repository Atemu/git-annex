Hmm, it looks like a perfectly valid list. Interesting.
But regardless, gpg doesn't seem to like that line; what gpg version
are you using? Also, does it work directly on the command-line
(`gpg -a --gen-random 1 1`)?

Have you tried to setup the remote without that line in the gpg.conf? Of
course it wouldn't solve the core of the issue, but it's irrelevant for
random data generation anyway (the same goes for `--trust-model`);
perhaps this very command should be run with `--no-options`.
