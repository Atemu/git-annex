git annex sync exportremote -J2 --content

git-annex: thread blocked indefinitely in an MVar operation
failed
git-annex: thread blocked indefinitely in an STM transaction

Also, git-annex export -J2 crashes the same way. I discovered this bug
when adding -J to export, but then found sync had the same bug.

To reproduce this, there may need there to be a tree of several annexed 
files whose content is not locally available. In my case,
there were 338 of them. It seems to export all, or all but 1
before crashing. --[[Joey]]
