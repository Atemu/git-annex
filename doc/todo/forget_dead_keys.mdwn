Make git-annex forget --drop-dead also remove log files for keys that have
been marked as dead.

This would have the benefit of reducing the size of the git-annex branch. 
Also it would eliminate mention of the key in the git-annex branch's
history. 

Although whether it would actually delete *all* mention of a key is a bit
hard to guarantee. Can remove all the log files that are specific to a key,
like presence and metadata and chunks and remote state. But, the export.log
refers to trees, and somewhere in a tree there could be a reference to a
dead key.
