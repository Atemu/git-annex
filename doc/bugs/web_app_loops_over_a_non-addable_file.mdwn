### Please describe the problem.

I started the webapp on a pre-existing repo today, and it started adding all sorts of files which I didn't manually add, which is a little bit surprising, but "okay".

The problem is that it would loop over this one file over and over again. Adding it on the commandline yields a proper error, but this doesn't seem to properly propagate to the frontend.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Unclear.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20131105-g8efdc1a

### Please provide any additional information below.

Here's the daemon.log:

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log

And here's the attempt on the commandline, which is way more informative:

[[!format sh """
anarcat@marcos:video$ git annex add .
add clips/96_257.mp3 ok
add clips/A31-05-12_21.22.amr (checksum...)

failed
"""]]

Turns out that file is owned by root, so it's an expected failure. But the webapp should simply skip this file, not loop over it.

The workaround is obviously to give this file to the proper user. --[[anarcat]]
