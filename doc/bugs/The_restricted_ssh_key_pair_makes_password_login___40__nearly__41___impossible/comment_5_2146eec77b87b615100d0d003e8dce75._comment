So what I did on a clean ubuntu install was

1. start git-annex-webapp Version: ( 4.20130413-g5747bf4 )
2. set up local repository and remote ssh repository
3. sync some files
4. trying to ssh from the console to the remote now fails with error message \"git-annex-shell: bad parameters\"

I do believe it has always done this (also on wheezy). Is this supposed to work this way? Hope to get a webdav / owncloud / some own hosted system not relying on ssh. Just want to sync files to a headless server. I'll gladly help if I can.
