Ok progress!  I think we have resolved the issue.  The [instructions](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_your_own_server/) are missing a key command.  From the \"set up the server\" section, you need to `git annex init` in the newly created bare git repo, e.g.:

```
server# cd
server# git init annex.git --bare --shared
server# cd annex.git
server# git annex init server
```

Once the newly-created bare git repo is git-annex initialized, things seem to work properly.  yay!

It also seems to work for both absolute and relatively specified directories on the remote.  I have tested with both.  So I guess the odd path in the ssh command is a red herring, and git-annex-shell known how to resolve the path correctly.  Very good.

Thank you @joey and @lukey for the help.  I guess we can close this issue once the instructions are properly updated.  Thanks!
