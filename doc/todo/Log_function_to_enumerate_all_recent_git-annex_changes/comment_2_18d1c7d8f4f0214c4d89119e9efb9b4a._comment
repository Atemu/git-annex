Implelemented `git annex log --all`. It turned out to fit really well
to add the functionality there.

You can use --max-count, or even --since to limit the log
that's displayed.

The output streams, so you could just remember the first line you saw when
running it before, and close the pipe when the subsequent run outputs that
line. (Although this method may skip over changes that got merged in from
another repository.)
