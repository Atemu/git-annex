In the alternatepipenullsplit branch, I made what I think is the relevant
part of LsFiles not use a lazy bytestring, but instead read chunks
directly to strict bytestrings. It did not change the PINNED amount or reduce
overall memory use.

So the pinning must be happening somewhere other than where I had assumed
it was happening.
