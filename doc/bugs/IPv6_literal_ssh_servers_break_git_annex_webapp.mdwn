### Please describe the problem.
When trying to set up the Git Annex webapp to sync with an SSH server on Windows, specifying the remote server address ans an IPv6 literal address will result in an Internal Server Error like this:

`C:\Users\anovak\.ssh\git-annex\key.git-annex-fc2e:f79e:da52:bd92:74f8:b045:e365:5e9d-anovak_22_.2Fhome.2Fanovak.2Fannex: openFile: invalid argument (Invalid argument)`

I think the problem is that it's not escaping the colons, and you can't have colons in a filename on Windows.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Have Git Annex Webapp runnign on Windows.
2. Go to the "Adding a remote server using ssh" page.
3. Enter an IPv6 literal address (in brackets), like `[fc2e:f79e:da52:bd92:74f8:b045:e365:5e9d]`, under "Host name". I hyappen to be using cjdns addresses, but I bet you get the same issue with Internet addresses.
4. Add the server, and elect to combine repositories if prompted.
5. You should get the error.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I have Git Annex: `Version: 6.20160613-g35dbe35` on Windows 7.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yeah, it works great on my Linux machines. I'm just getting started with the web app, though; I'm trying to set up limited-access key-based SSH, and the web app seems to be also trying to do that...
