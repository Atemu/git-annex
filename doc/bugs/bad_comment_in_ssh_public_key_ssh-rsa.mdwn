What steps will reproduce the problem?
I was trying to pair two repositories on 2 different computers, 
but my public key had this email address at the end:
bachir@Bachirs-iMac.local

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I was expecting successful pairing.
I got:
bad comment in ssh public key ssh-rsa
AAB3....SAK
bachir@Bachirs-iMac.local

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
I am using the package git-annex  Version: 3.20120925 
on MacOSX Lion

Please provide any additional information below.
I've checked your code, seems to complain about the dash '-' in the email address
bachir@Bachirs-iMac.local
