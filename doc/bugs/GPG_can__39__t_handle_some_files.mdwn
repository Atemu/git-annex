### Please describe the problem.

It looks like GPG is being used in text mode, or at least isn't overriding the GPG config.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Have a binary file with long lines, and attempt to copy it into git-annex.

This will happen:

    $ git-annex copy 09\ Into\ The\ Dissonance.mp3 -t rsync.net_annex
    copy 09 Into The Dissonance.mp3 (gpg) (checking rsync.net_annex...) (to rsync.net_annex...) gpg: can't handle text lines longer than 19995 characters
    failed
    git-annex: copy: 1 failed

A workaround is to remove "textmode" from your gpg.conf, but git-annex should force this.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

7ae625363bcb6e1fc8b3733c1d7814aca05a2368 on Ubuntu 13.04 x86_64
