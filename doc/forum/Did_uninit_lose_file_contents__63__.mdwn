I seem to have lost the contents of some files after running `git annex uninit`, and I'm not sure where I went wrong.

Here is what I think I did, in order:

- Create annex - `git init && git annex init`.

- Set thin mode - `git config annex.thin true && git annex fix`.

- Set largefiles size - `git config annex.largefiles anything`.

- Set addunlocked - `git config annex.addunlocked true`.

- Added all files - `git annex add` (~135,000 files, ~350GiB).

- Cloned the repo to a couple of other locations (one bare git repo, and one NTFS hard drive), and added them as remotes of one another.

- Created an adjusted branch (hidemissing).

- Did git-annexy things between the repos, ie. `sync`, `get`, `move`, `drop`, `whereis` (these all worked fine).

Then I ran `git annex uninit` and it seemed to start OK (there was output that looked like it was moving files out of the annex), so I left it running overnight. This morning it was still running, but every file it seemed to be processing was displaying errors like this:

```
error: path/to/file1.mp3: cannot add to the index - missing --add option?
fatal: Unable to process path path/to/file1.mp3
(recording state in git...)
error: path/to/file2.mp3: cannot add to the index - missing --add option?
fatal: Unable to process path path/to/file2.mp3
(recording state in git...)
```

I stopped it with Ctrl-C, and ran `git annex uninit` again. The command ran for a few seconds, and then finished with this output:

```
Deleted branch git-annex (was f08b3b7c92).
```

Looking at the contents of one of these files, it looks like the content should still be in the annex?

```
$ cat "path/to/file1.mp3"
/annex/objects/SHA256E-s8540947--baaf8e92ad996686bb4e507954ee014c8f43b9e4c5f19d524b6305f2a967d255.mp3
```

But the annex is gone!?

```
$ ls .git/annex/
ls: cannot access '.git/annex/': No such file or directory
```

So I'm wondering two things:

1. Is there any way to get the contents of these files back (without using the cloned repos or backups in other locations)?

2. Did the contents of these files get removed from the annex without the original files being restored? If so, why?
