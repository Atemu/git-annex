It'd also be helpful if this could be integrated into the unannex subcommand:

`git annex add file` -> realise it shouldn't have been added -> `git annex unannex --forget file`

That would make for a rather intuitive and user-friendly workflow.

If the git-annex branch is unpushed, it could even be rebased to reflect that change but that might be too complicated to do reliably.
