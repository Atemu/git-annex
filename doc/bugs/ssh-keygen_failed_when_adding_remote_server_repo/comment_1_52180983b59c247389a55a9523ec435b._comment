Apologies for not following up on this bug sooner..

It seems to me that your system has a broken ssh-keygen program. You didn't say how you installed git-annex, but based on the git rev in the version number, I'm guessing you either built it yourself, or you're using the standalone tarball I build.

In the case of the latter, it didn't include ssh-keygen, so would try to use the one that comes with fedora. It seems likely that the problem comes from the libraries included in the bundle being used with a binary not in the bundle, that in turn is also using additional libraries.

So, I think I should add ssh-keygen to the standalone bundle!
