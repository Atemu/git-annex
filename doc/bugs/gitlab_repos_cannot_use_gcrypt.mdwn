It's not possible to use gcrypt with gitlab repos, despite the webapp
currently offering this as an option. The resulting remote works as far as
pushes go, but fails with an error "Failed to connect to remote to set it
up."

It seems that the gitlab repo is somehow in a state where git-annex-shell
configlist reports it's not yet a git-annex repo, but git-annex-shell
gcryptsetup fails with "gcryptsetup refusing to run; this repository already has a git-annex uuid!"

This does not happen when I try the same setup on a self-hosted repo.
Unsure what is causing git-annex-shell to behave this way on gitlab.
