This seems reasonable to me.

One other possibility that you could end up with a duplicate: if `glacier-cli`'s cache is not up to date. For example: hosts A and B both have (the same) annex with the same Glacier special remote defined. Host A copies a file to Glacier. On host B, the `glacier-cli` cache doesn't know about the file, and so a copy to Glacier on host B also succeeds. When the cache is later brought up to date `glacier vault sync`, then the duplicate appears.

I'm not sure what we can do about this. Perhaps we need to accept that duplicates will occur, and handle them more gracefully.
