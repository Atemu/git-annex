Concerning the filtering, I'd find a note that \"--batch-keys is mutually exclusive with filtering\" perfectly acceptable if that makes implementation easier. (Or \"only with the filtering options that apply to keys\" -- as I found that `git annex whereis --in web --key=...` does work well with the key input).
