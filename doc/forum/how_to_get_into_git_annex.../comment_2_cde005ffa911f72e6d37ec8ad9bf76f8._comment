the most recent example I've run across is the use of 
git.annex=thin 
in the link here: https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files/
it didn't result in a hardlink being made of the content for either git annex unlock or git annex unannex
instead I ended up getting the same functionality by use --fast.
