I currently use dolphin Version 14.12.3 but it's been broken for me forever. I always had my own fix but now it keeps getting overwritten by git-annex.

the current line in my git-annex version is:

sh -c 'cd \"$(dirname '%U')\" && git-annex get --notify-start --notify-finish -- %U'

The problem is that %U gives an url style file (file:///some/path) which git-annex doesn't understand.

Further more the quoting is broken because and i quote:

\"Field codes (%F,%U) must not be used inside a quoted argument, the result of field code expansion inside a quoted argument is undefined.\"

Additionally I don't think it's possible to prevent an arbitrary command injection unless you have the Field code as a single argument.

The command_string_is_ignored is just the string that will be assigned to $0 which is not used. You could use it instead of $1 but didn't like using the command string as an argument.
