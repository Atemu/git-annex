### Please describe the problem.

umask is 022 on both hosts
If one does ls -lL on source repo, the files are shown 644.

Now, "git annex get" from a clone done over ssh generally preserves 644 ... except if the transfer (rsync) is interrupted, and then resumed.
In fact, looks like the temp files in .git/annex/tmp have the og+r bits cleared during the resumed transfer.

So this is inconsistent: I don't see why permissions should be different, depending whether or not there was an interruption in the transfer.
Plus, og+r permissions can actually be important for setups like serving contents using Samba.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    cd dir1
    git init
    git annex init
    touch a
    truncate -s 10G b
    git annex add .
    git commit -m 'new'

    git clone localhost:/path/to/dir1 dir2
    cd dir2
    git annex get
    ctrl^c
    ls -lL
    ... see different perms
