Setup:

* fresh install of Debian Wheezy on machines A & B, git-annex 4.20130227 pulled in from unstable
* clone repository onto A & B and pair them (manual SSH key setup), and plug USB backup drive, U, into A
* U has repository group `backup` and preferred content string `standard`
* A & B have repository group `client` and preferred content string `present or include=subdir1/* or ...`

Steps:

* Add a new file to B
* On B, `git annex copy -t A newfile`

Expected:

* File arrives at B and is copied to U by B's assistant
* File remains on B

Actual:

* File arrives on B and is copied to U
* File is dropped from B

Seems like a resurfacing of [[forum/assistant_overzealously_moving_stuff_to_other_repos]]?  Thanks.
