Several commenters seem to be under the misapprehension that `git add` of a
modified file that is stored in git before will annex the new version. It
does not. That case is already handled, by git-annex noticing if the old
file was annexed, and if not, letting git add it to git as usual
(unless annex.largefiles is configured, in which case it uses that
configuration).
