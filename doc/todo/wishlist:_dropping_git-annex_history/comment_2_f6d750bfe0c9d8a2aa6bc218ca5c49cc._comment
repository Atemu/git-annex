If starting commit id _and_ commit id from when history is being dropped are documented, you could potentially drop more data.

* Don't have any commits in common? Full merge.
* Only share the starting ids? Reduce local history as much as possible, and then merge.
* Share both starting id and have the last id somewhere in history? Take history from last id up to current, reduce that, and merge.
