It would be awesome if there was the same --all option, and if the command produced something in bare repos, just like with the move / copy commands. At the moment for instance, it seems running git annex find on a bare repo returns nothing. There would be the question of the output format, but I guess one key per line is the obvious format one wants. I personally would want to run git annex find before a git annex move/copy, as a kind of dry-run, i.e. just to see the list of keys that will be transferred.
