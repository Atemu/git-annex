Hi, I've sorted this now.  The IP address of my laptop had changed on the local network.  Fixing it then let the new fix fully work and the in-progress status of the bad repo went away.

Is it right that in the UI I don't see the local LAN configured branch (which I setup for speed) - it all seems to come under the jabber account now and makes an appropriate choice?
