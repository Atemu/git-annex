Aaah, sorry, yeah, `git-annex info` is very slow its checks many things locally and remotelyâ€¦ (i've seen it run for 30min+ on some of my repos). No, worries I don't think we'll learn too much more from that command than we learned from the `du` commands.

You indeed do have some un-accounted for space in `.git`, I usually expect most of the space to be in the git-annex or git objects folders but that only accounts for 1.6 of the 501 GB in your .git folder.

What are the outputs of `du -h -d 1 .git/` thats a level-1 listing of files in .git, and `du -h -d 1 .git/annex/` thats for files in the annex specific folder? That will help narrow down where the space is eaten up from. Perhaps `.git/annex/misctmp` or `.git/annex/tmp` are the culprits.
