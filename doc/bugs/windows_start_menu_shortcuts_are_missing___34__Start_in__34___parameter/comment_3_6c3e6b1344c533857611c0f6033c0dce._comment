I'm guessing this doesn't affect XP, so I'm going to need to rely on you
guys for help and testing for the newer Windows..

Makes sense about git-annex.lnk trying to run itself, I suppose. Sort of.

The DSL I'm using to generate the NSIS installer and thus this file
doesn't currently seem to have a way to set the "Start in" parameter.
I can get that added, but it would take a while.

I don't see any reason not to use the "git annex webapp" approach.
Should be the same as long as git's in path, and if git's not in path,
well.

Alternatively, though, I could rename the menu item to something else, like
"git-annex-menu.lnk". Seems that would also avoid the problem, and somewhat
more robustly. I don't like this business of conflicting command-names
being in path. Renaming the menu item has the downside of needing a
uninstall/reinstall cycle to avoid getting a duplicate menu item, but
otherwise seems reasonable.
