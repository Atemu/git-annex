I want to create a repo with the contents of an old repo, but with a fresh commit history, etc. I do not care about preserving the old repo.

However, I just want to make sure that the following steps will not result in the new repo being broken in some way:

1. Create a new git annex repo.
2. Copy all of the symlinks from the old repo to the new one.
3. Move .git/annex/objects from the old repo to the new one.
4. Then "git annex add" everything in the new repo and commit.

Please let me know also if there is a better way to achieve the same results.

Thanks for your help.
