I've implemented --debugfilter which can select the debug output you want
to see.

Also started splitting out the immutable parts of AnnexState, but that does
not yet include debug options, due to the way option parsing currently
works. Once that gets done, there's a new fastDebug that can be used inside
tight loop code paths.
