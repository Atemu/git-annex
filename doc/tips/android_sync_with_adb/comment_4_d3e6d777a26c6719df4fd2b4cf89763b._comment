Well, how would I know that that was significant? I resumed the import after interrupting it and let it run till it finished (several days actually). 

In fact, I let \"import\" run several times till the end, the first time taking a lot of time, and the next ones taking ~10 minutes each.

Indeed, there seems to be no android_cable/master branch

```

$ git --no-pager branch -ra
  git-annex
  synced/master

```

I tried to create the branch manually, but there seems to be no `git-annex branch`.

In addition, this post is easily googleable, whereas \"forum\" is not. I believe that documenting a typical-of-the-typical issue that a user may encounter at the place which if the point of the first consultation is fairly useful.
