I made an Ubuntu saucy chroot, apt-get installed git-annex from universe, and ran the webapp in there. I did not reproduce this problem. 

The cause of the problem, it seems, must be something local to your system. Perhaps you have an environment variable set that is messing up git. Or perhaps you have a different, broken version of git installed.

Can you \"git show git-annex\" in the repository? It should show a commit made to the git-annex branch that adds the uuid.log there.
