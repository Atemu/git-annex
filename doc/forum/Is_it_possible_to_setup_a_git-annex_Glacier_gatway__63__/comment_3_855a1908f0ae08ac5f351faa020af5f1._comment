Hi,

If the repo on SRV1 was a normal \"client\" repo, if something was moved to archive on one of the clients shouldn't it upload to glacier, replace it with a shortcut and propagate it to other clients?

The test I just ran SRV1 uploaded and replaced the file but the client copies were not removed. I understand the clients cannot check with glacier to know the file could be deleted, but maybe is there some \"numcopies\" hack to be used? :)
