### Please describe the problem.

The git-annex manual page is not installed when using [[install/cabal]] to install git-annex.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Follow [[install/cabal]] with `--bin-dir=/usr/local` and try `man git-annex`.

I was expecting the manpage to be installed in `/usr/local/share/man`.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git annex from a recent git build (4.20130909-g7f079d6) in Debian wheezy.

### Please provide any additional information below.

<del>This could be just a documentation problem...</del> Actually, the manpage can be read directly from the source tree in `doc/git-annex.mdwn`, but I still think it should be installed, for [[!wikipedia POLA]]'s sake. --[[anarcat]]

I figured it out - that stuff is in the makefile, I updated [[install/cabal]] accordingly, so done. --[[anarcat]]
