### Please describe the problem.
When setting git-annex on a device (a mac at least in my case), where git has never been used, you get a cryptic git error in the assistant which prevents you to create your first repo.
Going to the terminal and running git --global for email and name solved the problem.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
