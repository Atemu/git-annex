Hello,

i'm in the process of managing my music collection with git-annex. The initial "git annex add" using the sha1 banckend is quite long an i was wondering that it could be nice to launch multiple "sha1sum" processes in parallel to speed up things.

Anyway, thanks for this wonderful piece of software.
