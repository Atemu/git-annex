I think there are two potential problems with this change:

1. Bloat. If someone is not going to use that metadata, they may not want
   the overhead of attaching it to every file.

2. It's entirely possible that a user has chosen to use year/month/day
   metadata fields for their own purposes. Perhaps they are using it to
   keep track of the original publication date of files, and so would not
   want "wrong" values to be automatically added.

And that's essentially the reason why all parts of git-annex that deal
with specific metadata fields are optional, so there's no default 
hard-coded semantics to the metadata fields.

(With the exception of git-annex importfeed, which always
stores the itemid from the rss feed in the metadata, but only because
it's needed to detect buggy feeds that change their item urls.)
