You need to use git config to set that, not git-annex config.

git-annex config can only be used with a few carefully
chosen configuration settings that make sense to 
apply to all clones of the repository. annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses
is not amoung those. This is clearly documented in the git-annex config man
page IMHO, but I'm always interested to learn about problems with
documentation.
