[[!meta title="what git-annex is not"]]

* git-annex is not a backup system. It may be a useful component of an
  [[archival|use_case/bob]] system, or a way to deliver files to a backup
  system.

  For a backup system that uses git, take a look at
  [bup](http://github.com/apenwarr/bup).

* probably several other things..
