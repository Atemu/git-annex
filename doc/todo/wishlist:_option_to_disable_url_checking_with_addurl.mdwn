I'm testing out an idea of using filter-branch on a git repository to both retroactively annex and AND record a weburl for all relevant files.

c.f. [http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/How_to_retroactively_annex_a_file_already_in_a_git_repo/](http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/How_to_retroactively_annex_a_file_already_in_a_git_repo/)

The bottleneck I'm hitting here seems to be the fact that `git annex addurl` diligently checks each url to see that it is accessible, which adds up quickly if many files are to be processed.

It would be great if addurl had an option to disable checking the url, in order to speed up large batch jobs like this.
