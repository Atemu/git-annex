Thanks for your hint, I appretiate that and I think it could be done that way.

However, on closer thought I was wondering if git-annex is the right tool for job. I had the impression that my idea came more from a hammer and nail situation. So, FUSE came to my mind. I popped it into google and found this: https://github.com/FS-make-simple/fusecompress
Unfortunately this does not look very active though.

Now, since I'm already at the FS layer I can look into ZFS compression. My repos are already on ZFS but I haven't looked at the built-in compression yet. I think I'll evaluate that first. If none of that is satisfactory I'll turn to git-annex again :)
