As I don't own any mac hardware, and don't plan to buy any, and I don't know of a way to just spin up a OSX VM in the cloud, I'm reliant on git-annex users for running builds for the various versions of OS X. 

I think there's a chance that one of the two people currently doing builds for older versions will upgrade their system. Although of course then we lose builds for that older version. Alternatively, I'm waiting for someone to either volenteer to set up a builder for 10.9, or give me ssh access to a machine were I can do it.
