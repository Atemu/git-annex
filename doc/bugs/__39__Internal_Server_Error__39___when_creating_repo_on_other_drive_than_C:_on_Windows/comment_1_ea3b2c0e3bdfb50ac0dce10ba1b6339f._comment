I can reproduce this bug (using drive E:)

It's caused by [[!commit e93206e2945c476c3305a73e41113efd781268cd]], which forced msysgit to use unix-style paths to repositories.

Unless I can find a way to use dos-style paths with msysgit 1.8.4 (or it's fixed in a newer version), I can't pass it drive letters, so it tries to use the default/current drive instead of the one where the repository is really located.

My preferences to fix this:

1. Try a newer msysgit, and perhaps it's fixed there to support --git-dir with a DOS-style path. (For example, in C:\FOO, see if this command work: `git init; git --git-dir=C:\FOO\.git --work-tree=C:\FOO status`)
2. File a bug on msysgit, get it fixed. 1.8.3.msysgit.0 *did* support that.
3. Make git-annex not pass --git-dir and --work-tree in Windows. But this would be quite ugly; while normally it is operating in the repository in the CWD, sometimes it's not.

Workaround: if you're at the prompt, this works, because it changes the current drive before using git-annex, and so the unix-style paths just work:

    E:
    cd annex
    git annex init
