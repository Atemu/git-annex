hi there, sincere gratitude for your work on git-annex.

is it worth considering a more modular setup (maybe a python script :) or even haskell) for working with metadata extractors?

currently it really only supports field-based filtering extractors. i am particularly interested in using (minimally):

mp3info - offers a formatting string for printing but doesn't fit super nicely into the \"want\" fields in shell script. could probably be hacked in.

mp4info - does not seem to offer any native parameters for filtering; would likely need some engineering/thought about how to take in all possible fields then filtering off of those.

alternatively i could just write some personal scripts here, but just thought others would find it useful for auto extracting content from mp3/m4a files. extract doesn't seem to perform as well on these as, say, .flac files.

thanks again!
