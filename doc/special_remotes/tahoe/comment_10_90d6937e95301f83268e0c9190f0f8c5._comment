On debian buster, copying to or from tahoe seems to alway cause an attempt to start a new tahoe process, even if one is already running, resulting in error messages like this  on second or subsequent attempts:

    copy P5273249.JPG STARTING '/home/jk/.tahoe-git-annex/3677c81a-5cd0-4817-9ad3-a7c29b74a7b7'
    starting node in '/home/jk/.tahoe-git-annex/3677c81a-5cd0-4817-9ad3-a7c29b74a7b7'
    Another twistd server is running, PID 20860
   
    This could either be a previously started instance of your application or a
    different application entirely. To start a new one, either run it in some other
    directory, or use the --pidfile and --logfile parameters to avoid clashes.

Not a massive problem as everything seems to work.
