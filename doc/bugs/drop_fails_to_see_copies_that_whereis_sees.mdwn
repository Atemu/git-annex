What steps will reproduce the problem?
------------------------------------------------------

I haven't tried doing this again, but here's what I did:

I was copying files to my usb drive (hugex) with probably this command:

    git annex copy --to=hugex .

While doing that, I did something stupid in another window, and filled my local hard drive (the one I was copying from) and git annex spit out some errors about not being able to write to log files (because my local drive was full.)

I suspended (^Z) git annex, made some hard drive space, then resumed (fg).

At first, git annex whereis didn't see the copies of some of the files in hugex (apparently the ones where git annex had trouble writing the local log files). After a "git remote update hugex" and I think a ``git annex merge``, whereis was able to see both copies.

But git drop can't see both copies, and won't let me drop my local copy. I ran ``git annex fsck .`` on the directory with the now files I was copying above, and that didn't seem to change anything (or report errors.)

Here's a terminal session where I'm showing the problem and some hopefully useful text:

	compy compy compy ~/video/tv/keen-eddie> git annex whereis 02-horse-heir.avi 
	whereis 02-horse-heir.avi (2 copies) 
  		5bfe091c-ed07-11df-842e-eb791a485889 -- here (compy)
   		e15161ec-f1bf-11df-a7b5-eb1f0e6921ee -- hugex
	ok
	compy compy compy ~/video/tv/keen-eddie> git annex drop 02-horse-heir.avi 
	drop 02-horse-heir.avi (unsafe) 
  	  Could only verify the existence of 1 out of 2 necessary copies

  	  No other repository is known to contain the file.

  	  (Use --force to override this check, or adjust annex.numcopies.)

That last command is showing that the file is indeed in hugex's annex/objects


Oh, and another wrinkle. hugex is a bare repo. I tried to fsck hugex's video/tv directory, but it said that directory doesn't exist (I assume because there's no working copy.)


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd like ``git annex drop`` to have the same kind of confidence in the copies of these files on hugex.

How can I resolve this. I tried ``git annex copy --to=hugex .`` again, but that command knows that these files are already copied to hugex.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20130102 on debian unstable (thanks for packaging!)
