One other thing, sorry, but I think this is important:  From the perspective of the Full Backup repo, I set the Transfer repo to be deleted, thinking that would prevent the desktop's Client and Full Backup repos from syncing through the Transfer repo.  But then when I switch to the perspective of the desktop's Client repo, it is \"cleaning out\" the Transfer repo--but I wanted the Transfer repo to be used for syncing the two Client repos!  So I set it back to Transfer instead of Unwanted...but then when I switch back to the Full Backup perspective, the Transfer repo is no longer Unwanted.
