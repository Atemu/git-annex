### Please describe the problem.

I get an error in one of my repositories. 

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I paired my macbook repository with an repository on my desktop. The repository on the desktop contains many smaller files, because it is my documents folder.

Pairing this repository with smaller files never worked for me. I posted to the forum about it:
[[forum/ssh__95__exchange__95__identification:_read:_Connection_reset_by_peer/]]

I am a little confused because I paired three other repositories between these computers sucessfully. They contain pictures, videos and music.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version: 5.20140106-gcb3351b
Build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV FsEvents XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA CryptoHash 

Mac OS X Mavericks
