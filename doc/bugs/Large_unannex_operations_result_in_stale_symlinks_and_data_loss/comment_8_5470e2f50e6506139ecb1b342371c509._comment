Filenames are the index which users use to find their data.

Leaving a broken symlink may not result in technical data loss, but can quite possibly result in the user being unable to find the data which was referenced by that filename (symlink), so in that case that data _is_ lost, in the true sense of the word (the user cannot find it). Telling the user their data exists _somewhere_ is not actually making the situation any better.
