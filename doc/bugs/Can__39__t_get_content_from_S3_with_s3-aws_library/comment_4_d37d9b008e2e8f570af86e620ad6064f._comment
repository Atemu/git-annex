I've sent an email regarding this.

One comment, it seems that it's not possible to change the configuration of an S3 remote, as ``enableremote`` causes git-annex to try to create a new bucket (which fails, as the name is already used). Otherwise, I could try to tell git-annex it has the region wrong. Perhaps an option ``use-existing-bucket`` or something would work?
