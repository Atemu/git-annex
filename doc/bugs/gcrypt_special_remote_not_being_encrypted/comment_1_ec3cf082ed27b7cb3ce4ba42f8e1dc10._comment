What's going on here is, you have cloned a gcrypt repository so have it as
the origin remote. git-annex is storing files in that remote as if it were
a regular git remote. It's not being used as a special remote at all.

This is surely a bug; git-annex should notice that remote has a gcrypt-id
and treat it as a gcrypt remote, or refuse to use it since it's not set up
as a special remote.

It also seems that only git annex sync --content behaves this way;
git annex copy "cannot determine uuid for origin".
