What git-annex could do is avoid passing -p to cp when it's running on
android.

Utility.Android.osAndroid already has a way to detect
that, but running uname on every file copy is not an acceptable
performance hit, so it would need to somehow only do it once.

I am not currently seeing a satisfactory way to do that,
everything adds at least some overhead (ie a MVar lookup) 
to every file copy in the non-android case, and it's just 
not acceptable that a niche use case like android adversely
affect linux.

Also, I don't think I saw this when I used git-annex on android,
although I'm not sure if I tried anything that does copy a file.
And it probably happens when the repo is in the sdcard, but not when it's
in other locations, like the termux home directory, that are not on the
mess of a filesystem stack that android uses for the sdcard.
