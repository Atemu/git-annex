### Please describe the problem.
I am unable to restore a git-annex dir to its pre init state.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
init a git-annex dir on android with a file system with out symlinks.
use for a while.
Run: "git-annex uninit" -> You cannot run this command in a direct mode repository.
Run: "git-annex indirect" -> Git is configured to not use symlinks, so you must use direct mode.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 4.20130601-g7483ca4
