It seems to me that what you are describing is fundamentally a branch,
call it "orig". Whenever you add a new file, you do so in a repository
with the orig branch checked out. Then you `git merge orig` into a
repository with the master branch checked out, and get on with renaming the
files.

I would be wary of changing the branch that is checked out when the
git-annex watcher/assistant is running as that might confuse it. I would
probably just make a separate clone of the repository that has the orig
branch checked out all the time, do the imports into there, and then 
`git annex move` the file contents over to the main repository.
