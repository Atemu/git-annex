This is not a new protocol, it was added 2 years ago for
git-annex's tor hidden service support.

git-annex already supports rclone via a special remote.

This protocol is only used when there's a git-annex repository
on the other end, so I don't see any benefit in making it compatible with
any other programs. And it has stuff in it that I'm sure if not in the
protocol you talked about, like LOCKCONTENT.
