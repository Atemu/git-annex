Made it check if the inherited config has encryption and skip setting it
up. So if there is a special remote that does not support encryption
config, it won't fail this way.

Come to think, at least tahoe does not support encryption config.
Although it seems very unlikely it would be useful combined with tahoe.

Of course, it still won't, and cannot possibly work when combined with a
http export of a git working tree. But then the docs are clear it won't
work with everything.
