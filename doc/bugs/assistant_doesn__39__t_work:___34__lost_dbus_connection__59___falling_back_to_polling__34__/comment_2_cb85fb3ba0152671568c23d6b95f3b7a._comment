git-annex only uses dbus to detect when drives and networks come and go, this has nothing to do with its core functionality and i would be very surprised if lack of dbus being installed prevented it from working in any way.

It's not clear to me if you think that installing dbus somehow fixed your issue. 

You seem to have filed a second bug report, [[Daemon_stops_working_on_mounted_CIF_share]] about the same symptoms, and in that bug report, it looks rather like your network(?) file system is badly broken and so git-annex cannot access it.

Please follow up with clarifications.
