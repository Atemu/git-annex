Running `git annex uninit` in a repo which has branch git-annex checked out will result in:

    error: Cannot delete the branch 'git-annex' which you are currently on.
    git-annex: git [Param "-D",Param "git-annex"] failed

and trying to checkout branch master afterwards results in:

    error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:

Both of which is logical. The best thing would be if git-annex refused to run uninit while in branch git-annex.
