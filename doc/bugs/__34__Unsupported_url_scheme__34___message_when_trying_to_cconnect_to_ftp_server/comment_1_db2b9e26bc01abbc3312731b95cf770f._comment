Behavior change due to a security hole being fixed. See the discussion
here:
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/regression__58___http_downloads_redirecting_to_ftp_are_no_longer_supported/>

While that bug was specific to redirects, as I note in the comment it's a
more general reversion, but necessary due to the security fix. Perhaps
I'll find a fix though.

The workaround is this which makes git-annex use curl: 

	git config annex.web-options -n
	git config annex.security.allowed-http-addresses all
