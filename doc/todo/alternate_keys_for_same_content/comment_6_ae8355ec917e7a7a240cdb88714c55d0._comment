There is also `aaa/bbb/*.log.cid` in git-annex branch for \"per-remote content identifiers for keys\".
It could be another place to store alternate keys, but it is per-remote, so... no.

As for the metadata field `alt_keys` â€” it is another case of
\"[setting a metadata field to a key](/todo/Bidirectional_metadata/#comment-788380998b25267c5b99c4a865277102)\"
in [[Bidirectional metadata]].

Also, there is an interesting idea of [[git-annex-migrate using git-replace]].

By the way, as far as I know (maybe things have changed since then),
ipfs has a similar problem of different identifiers for the same content.
Because it encodes how things are stored. And hash functions can also be changed.
