### Please describe the problem.

The webapp does not start automatically and instead this message is printed in the terminal:

    Falling back to hardcoded app location; cannot find expected files in /data/app-lib
    git annex webapp
    COLUMNS=0;LINES=0;export COLUMNS LINES;

After typing `git annex webapp`, the webapp starts normally.

If I click the WebApp entry in the terminal menu, nothing happens.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Launch Git Annex from the applications menu.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Using 4.3/4.4 daily build (nov 1st 2014) apk.
CyanogemMod 11 (M10)
