This would be super useful for my sorting annex! Being able to just drop the symlinks into other git-annex repositories and fetch the file from any of the \"storage\" ones (acting as caches) resolves [[todo/transfer_between_git-annexes]] in a very neat and safe way!

I see that git-annex won't merge the cache's git-annex branch with this setup (which is great, because some of them are *huge*) but when a repo fetches a file from the cache, it will note that the cache repo had the file in the location log, right?
Can this be avoided so the cache is entirely transient (once you remove the remote, there is no trace of it at all)?
