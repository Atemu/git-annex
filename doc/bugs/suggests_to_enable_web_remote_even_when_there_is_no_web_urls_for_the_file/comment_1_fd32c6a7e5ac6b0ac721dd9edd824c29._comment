Note that git-annex get from the web remote in this sitation says
"no known url" before the message you quoted.

Since location tracking and urls are separate peices of information, it's
certianly possible for them to be inconsistent like this.

It doesn't normally happen though. Eg, `git annex rmurl` of the last url
of a remote will update location tracking to say it's missing.
(Special remote SETURLMISSING does the same thing.)

One way it can happen is using `git-annex setpresentkey` 
to say a key is present in the web, and not setting an url.
But that's plumbing and it's up the user to use it consistently.

If you have some other way to get into this state that doesn't involve
plumbing commands, that could be a bug.

It might be possible to add something linking the data so that
location tracking for the web is ignored if it doesn't have urls, which
would also need to apply to some other special remotes that use urls, but
not others that only might have an associated url. I'm doubtful of this
idea tho.
