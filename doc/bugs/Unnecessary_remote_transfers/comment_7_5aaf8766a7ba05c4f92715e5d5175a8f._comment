* The costs you show look fine.
* Yes, deleting a repository in the webapp actually deletes it. It doesn't just remove the remote from .git/config. Most people using the webapp don't want to draw such a fine distinction, I think.
* It's not a very usual configuration to have 2 repositories on the same machine with the git-annex assistant running in both. You might just want to configure the assistant to not run in the backup repository.

Some of the things you've said suggest that the backup repository might not be immediately noticing when changes are pushed to it. Since its location is shown as /mnt/debian/home/me, I have to wonder if that's some NFS mount or other network filesystem causing problems.
