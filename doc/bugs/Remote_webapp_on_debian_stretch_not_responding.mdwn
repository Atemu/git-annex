In a fresh repository installation on debian stretch (arm) (git-annex version: 6.20170101)
the remote webapp will start and present the dashboard page,
however any request made by clicking any link does not receive a response.

I have a workaround: to ssh into my server and access the webapp locally using lynx browser, and that does seem to work well.

It presents me with a warning:

warning

   WebApp crashed: xdg-open: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec:
   does not exist (No such file or directory)

I'm not getting any errors, just the requests not returning responses.

I'm pretty new to this software.
