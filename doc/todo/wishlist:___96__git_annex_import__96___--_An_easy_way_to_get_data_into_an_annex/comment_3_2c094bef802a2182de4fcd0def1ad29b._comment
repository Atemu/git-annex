To expand on this a bit:

* I meant \"ugh, me\" not \"ugh, anyone else\"; I simply did not see it...
* `git annex import` on a separate annex should copy over the symlinks and the objects behind it and then run `git annex add`, thus verifying, fixing symlinks, etc, imo.
* Something that may not be said often enough: Thanks :)
