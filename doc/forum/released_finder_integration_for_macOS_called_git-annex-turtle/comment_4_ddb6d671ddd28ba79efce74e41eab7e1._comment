Thanks [anarcat](http://git-annex.branchable.com/users/anarcat/)!

[RabbitVCS](http://rabbitvcs.org/) provides Nautilus 3 icons for git, that might be a reasonable starting point for enhanced git-annex icons on Linux. Also, [nautilus-git](https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/nautilus-git) is minimal and quite pretty. I don't know what flavor of file manager they were using when they took their screenshots.
