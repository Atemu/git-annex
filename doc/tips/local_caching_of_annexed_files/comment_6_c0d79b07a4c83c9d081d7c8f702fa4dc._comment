I think we do call out to `annex merge` from time to time to update information about annex objects availability from any remote it might want to do so.  Since `sync` does more we avoid using it for those cases.  `git annex merge` doesn't even care about any argument given to it, so we cannot simply avoid calling it on `cache` remotes by specifying all other remotes.  Would it be possible to get some option `--only-pullable` or alike to make it prevent merging \"caches\"?
