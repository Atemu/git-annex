It may be that they are only supporting a newer version of the S3
protocol that does authorization differently. The S3 library
git-annex uses defaults to V2 not V4.

I thought that library didn't properly support V4, but it seems it does,
although I don't know if it works in all cases. So, I've added an
initremote option for S3, signature=v4 .. give it a try.
