Had a closer look at this, and I'm stumped. The ssh.exe from msysgit seems
to be built with `SSH_ASKPASS` support, based on strings. But, I cannot seem
to get it to use it.

OTOH, the ssh from cygwin did support this. Just had other problems so it's
not being used any longer.

At a guess, from reading ssh's code, I might need to find a way to defeat
ssh's isatty check on windows.

hints that there might be a way to start the process "with CreateProcess()
dwCreationFlags DETACHED_PROCESS" to make it work.
