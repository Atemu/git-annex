Some external special remotes need to run git-annex, for things not directly supported by the protocol; a dockerized remote implementation couldn't do that.  But maybe, the protocol could be extended with a command by which the remote asks git-annex to run a given git-annex command, and return paths to files containing the output and the exit code?
