Since uuid.log, trust.log and remote.log are union merged, it's possible
for any given item in them to have multiple values after a merge.
This would happen, for example, if the value was changed in different ways
in two repos which were then merged. git-annex will use an arbitrary
one of the multiple values.

A workaround if this should happen to you is to use `git annex describe`
or other commands to re-set the value you want. The process of setting
the value will remove the multiple lines.

To fix this the file format needs to be changed to include a timestamp
as is done with the other log files, then git-annex can consistently
pick the newest value -- which is as close to the "right" value as can be
determined in this situation.

(For backwards compatability, git-annex should
treat lines with no timestamp as being timestamped with 0.)
