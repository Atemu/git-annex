git-annex is trying to ssh (twice by the look of it) to a remote that is not involved in the copy. In this case, git-annex gives a usage error, but not before calling ssh twice:

    $ git annex copy --from=hugex --to=h2 01-pilot.avi
    ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.5 port 22: No route to host
    ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.5 port 22: No route to host
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
    
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    git-annex: only one of --from or --to can be specified

git-annex shouldn't be running ssh before checking commandline arguments! Or, in this case at all, since both remotes mentioned on the commandline are local:

    $ git config remote.hugex.url
    /media/hugex/jason/home.git
    $ git config remote.h2.url
    /media/h2/backup/git/home.git


I'm running git-annex 4.20130627 as shipped with debian unstable.

P.S. 192.168.1.5 is set as the HostName for one of my other remotes in my ~/.ssh/config, so this isn't _totally_ out of the blue.
