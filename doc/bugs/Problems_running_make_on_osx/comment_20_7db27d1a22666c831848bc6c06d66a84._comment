Outside the test suite, git-annex's actual use of cp puts fairly low demands on it. It tries to use cp -a or cp -p if available just to preserve whatever attributes it can preserve, but the worst case if that you have a symlink pointing to a file that doesn't have the original timestamp or whatever. And there's little expectation git preserves that stuff anyway.

I will probably try to make the test suite entirely use git clone rather than cp.
