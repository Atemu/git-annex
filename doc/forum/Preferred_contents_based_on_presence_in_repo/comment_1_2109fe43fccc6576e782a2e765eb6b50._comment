You could use the approach mentioned in the `preferred-content`
manpage:

    Preferred content expressions have no equivalent to the `--in`
    option, but groups can accomplish similar things. You can add
    repositories to groups, and match against the groups in a
    preferred content expression. So rather than `--in=usbdrive`,
    put all the USB drives into a \"transfer\" group, and use
    `copies=transfer:1`
