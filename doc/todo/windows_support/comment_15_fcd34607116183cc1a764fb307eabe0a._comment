`sc` can only be used by the administrator. That is problimatic.

Also, in order for sc to be used, the program has to have support for it. It cannot be any arbitrary program. win32-service adds such support. However, I have not been able to get programs using win32-service to build: <https://github.com/mikesteele81/Win32-services/issues/3>
