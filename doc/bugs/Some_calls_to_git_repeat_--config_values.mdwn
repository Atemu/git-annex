Some of git-annex's calls to git duplicate the `--config` values that
are passed by the caller.  Here's an example:

[[!format sh """
cd "$(mktemp -d --tmpdir gx-XXXXXXX)"
git init
git annex init -c foo.bar=true --debug
"""]]

```
[...]

Based on looking at the full output, it seems like a repeated
`--config` value gets tacked on each time after the configuration is
re-read.

The above is with a git-annex built from 8.20200226-161-g1978a2420.  I
see the same duplicates with a git-annex built from
7.20190819-2-g908476a9b.

Those extra values shouldn't cause any problems, but this issue seems
worth filing in case there's a simple fix.
