I now have a test case that shows that this can happen reliably on OSX if you enter the wrong XMPP password repeatedly. It might also happen if you just enter the wrong password once, with a server like google's, since the assistant will try falling back to different servers. John is aware of this haskell-gnutls problem.

John also found, and we hope fixed (but it's hard to tell) a bug in haskell-gnutls that caused a crash maybe 1 time in 10 under some conditions on OSX, when the right password was entered.
