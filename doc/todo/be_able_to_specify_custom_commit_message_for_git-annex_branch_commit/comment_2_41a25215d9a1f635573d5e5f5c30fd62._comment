My usecase is to be able to associate changes in main branches and in git-annex branch, so instead of non-informative \"update\" commit message it could carry e.g.

    [DATALAD] Updated git/annex from a remote location
    
    URLs processed: 7
     downloaded: 7
     size: 17.1 GB
    Files processed: 7
     skipped: 7
     overwritten: 7

or I might even include the branch in which changes were done, e.g. short ones become

    [DATALAD, incoming] Updated git/annex from a remote location
    [DATALAD, incoming-processed] Added files from extracted archives
    ...
    
Then looking at `git log git-annex` would allow me to quickly see what actions lead to \"updates\" in git-annex branch
