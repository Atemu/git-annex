Failure is always an option :) but if the failure is due to disk IO error
or disk full or memory error or whatever, it doesn't much matter which
particular item in the batch caused the error because you're going to want
to redo from start anyway.

I'll close this, if you find other commands whose batch interface can be
improved open more todos.
