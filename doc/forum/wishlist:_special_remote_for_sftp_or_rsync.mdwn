i think it would be useful to have a fourth kind of [[special remote]]s that connects to a dumb storage using sftp or rsync. this can be emulated by using sshfs, but that means lots of round-trips through the system and is limited to platforms where sshfs is available.

typical use cases are backups to storate shared between a group of people where each user only has limited access (sftp or rsync), when using [[bup]] is not an option.

an alternative to implementing yet another special remote would be to have some kind of plugin system by which external programs can provide an interface to key-value stores (i'd implement the sftp backend myself, but haven't learned haskell yet).
