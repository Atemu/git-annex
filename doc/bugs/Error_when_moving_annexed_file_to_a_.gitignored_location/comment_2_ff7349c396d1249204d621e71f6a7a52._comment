This bug was fixed, and closed 2 years ago. Posting a comment about another, related problem is not very useful. 

Yes, git annex import does not finish importing files if you've configured .gititnore to not allow those files to be added. If you need to do that, you could use `git annex import --force`, which will add the files despite the gitignore.
