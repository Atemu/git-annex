You don't need direct mode for this at all and there's no benefit to using
it in most cases.

You can just use regular git clones on the backup disks, and sync to them.
Running "git annex merge" in the clone on the backup disk at any time will
advance it to the most recently synced version with all the files in it,
and you can do that when you plug it into the new laptop.
