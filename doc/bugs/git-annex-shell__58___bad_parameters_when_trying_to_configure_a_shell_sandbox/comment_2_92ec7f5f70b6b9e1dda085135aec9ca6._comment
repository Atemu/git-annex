The wrapper program is not strictly necessary; this will work too:

	command="git-annex-shell -c \"$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\""

It might be nice if git-shell knew about `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND`
(and if it did, I'd make git-annex-shell mirror that),
but then that could be seen as making git depend on the transport
unncessarily.
