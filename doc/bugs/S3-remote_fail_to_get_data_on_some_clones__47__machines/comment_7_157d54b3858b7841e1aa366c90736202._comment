DNS is typically needed yes. That it gets a http response 
from some server seems to imply it's able to resolve the IP address of
the server. So I'd guess DNS is not the problem, unless it's resolving the
*wrong* IP address and connecting to the wrong server. Which would be
consistent with tcpdump not showing any traffic to the server.

ncsd can be configured on some systems to do DNS lookups. It's normal
for glibc to try to connect to nscd for a DNS lookup and fall back to a
regular lookup when it's not installed. That seems to be all your strace is
showing.

The next line of your strace shows it connecting to 127.0.0.53
That seems to be an address systemd sets up to use resolvd for dns.
That connection seems to succeed, so I guess dns resolution proceeds using
resolved.

All this DNS stuff is completely normal glibc name resolution as far as I
can see.

My suggestion is to tcpdump the entire network traffic when git-annex is
running, and analize that.
