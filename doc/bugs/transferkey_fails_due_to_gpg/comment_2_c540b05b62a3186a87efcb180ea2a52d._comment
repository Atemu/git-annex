Perhaps you mistook the \"(gpg)\" that git-annex prints out for a gpg prompt? If your transcript is accurate, things seem to be stalled, and gpg is not behaving like you're at a prompt when you type stuff to it, just the terminal is echoing back what you typed.

This then looks like it might be the same bug someone else mentioned here <http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/blog/day_70__adding_ssh_remotes/#comment-048f7fad45dc545f9d5a560491b275a1>

I have not managed to reproduce that problem. Are you seeing stalls with any particular size of file? Does it happen with very small files?
