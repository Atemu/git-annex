a <!-- (a suggestion for introducing severity tags on bugs,
feel free to discard) --> issue: `git annex initremote` (in particular, adding
a key as described in [[encryption]] -- `git annex initremote my_remote
encryption=my_key`) seems to iterate over the `.git-annex/???/???/*.log` files
with lstat (tested using strace).

in a 50k key git-annex on a slow disk, this takes quite a while, while not
seeming necessary (it's just re-encrypting the shared secret, is it?).

could you verify the observed behavior?
