Ok, those are good examples. I personally think it would be insane to use WORM in a repository in either of those cases, or really in almost any case where you do not have a strong degree of confidence that unique file contents have unique file names. If people are going to abuse WORM like that, it might be best to simply remove it. (Except I have quite a lot of WORMy disks.)

I suppose I'll add the extra data, although I remain unconvinced that it is going to help anyone who should actually be using WORM.
