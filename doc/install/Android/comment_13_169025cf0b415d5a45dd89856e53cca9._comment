Hey there!

It's been a while since the android app has worked. Are there any plans to get it working on modern Android versions? I assume it's pretty low demand, but it would make git-annex just so much more useful for me.

To clarify, I am experiencing this issue, as will everybody using Android >=6:

https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/android__58___cannot_link_executable/
https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html#behavior-runtime

I'm not certain, but I think it might just be a matter of compiling git-annex with this flag and releasing a new APK?

https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/13702

I'd be delighted to test if given an APK! Thanks again for the lovely git magic :).
