### Please describe the problem.
The first time I open the webapp on Android I see the following warning :

`WebApp crashed:<file descriptor 15>: hPutStr: illegal operation(handle_is_closed)`

See screen capture : [http://i.imgur.com/K0wkk2n.png](http://i.imgur.com/K0wkk2n.png)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Close git-annex if running
2. Open the WebApp

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
It says 1.0.52 in the Android settings but I'm using the daily build that I downloaded around 2013-05-29 13:10:00 (Eastern Time)

### Please provide any additional information below.

Git annex still syncs with `box.com` even if the warning is showing.

I'm using a Nexus 4 (4.2.2)

I didn't find `daemon.log`.
