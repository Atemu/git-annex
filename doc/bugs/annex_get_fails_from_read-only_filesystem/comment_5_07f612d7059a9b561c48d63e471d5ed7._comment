I agree that at least read-only support should be there. This error was from an filesystem type that is impossible to mount read-write.

Now that I am looking at it again with fresh eyes, I suppose it's possible to get around this by mounting an union filesystem with a read-write temp layer on top of the read-only one (not that a regular user would ever figure that out...)
