### Please describe the problem.

git annex will automatically create the file

.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/git-annex.desktop

However the actions created do not work because the variable used is %U (file:/// style URL) which git annex does not understand. All %U should be replaced by %F.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20141125

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
