Windows & haskell? I'd only be more surprised if spj wandered in here. ;)

So, that works because you're using ByteStrings. But git-annex mostly does not use ByteStrings, and it would be a lot of work to switch to them everywhere it reads FilePaths from git.

But it seems my test yesterday using `hSetEncoding h Encoding.utf8` went wrong somehow. That does work. git-annex can operate on the file with that change.
