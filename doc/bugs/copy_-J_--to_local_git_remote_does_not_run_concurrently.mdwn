I am copying files to a remote with -J3 and keep seeing this pattern:

	copy x (to remote..) ok
	copy foo (to remote...)
	47%   1.03 GiB         31 MiB/s 37s
	copy bar (to remote...)
	copy baz (to remote...)

Ie, there are 3 active jobs, but only one of them, typically the first of
them, is actually copying. The other 2 are blocked on something which must
be a resource the 1 is keeping busy.

That was with the remote having a path as an url. Changed it to
localhost:path and 3 transfers ran concurrently with progress meters.

copy --from/get also runs concurrently, only --to has the problem.

Also, a copy --to a directory special remote runs concurrently. So
only local path git remotes have the problem.

(Of course, there's often no benefit to parellizing writes to a disk as it
will cause seeking, but -J requests it, and if the disk was a SSD, it
would make sense to.)
