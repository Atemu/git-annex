This is a good idea, but unfortunately the interface that `git add` uses to
run git-annex doesn't provide a way for git-annex to request that the file
not be added. Even if git-annex exits with an error, git will assume the
best thing to do is to add the file itself. As documented in the gitattributes(5)
man page:

           A missing filter driver definition in the config, or a filter driver that
           exits with a non-zero status, is not an error but makes the filter a
           no-op passthru.

So this would I think need an extension to git..

However, there is a fairly easy way to convert an annexed file to be stored in git
if your annex.largefiles configuration didn't do the right thing:

	touch thefile
	git -c annex.largefiles=nothing add thefile
