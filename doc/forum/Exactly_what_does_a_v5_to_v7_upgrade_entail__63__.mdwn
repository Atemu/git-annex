I have some v5 indirect annexes with important data, one of which has hundreds of thousands of files, and I'm concerned about whether upgrading to v7 will result in data loss.

What exactly does the upgrade to v7 do? What is the likelihood of errors or losing data in any way? Will upgrading my biggest annex take a long time?
