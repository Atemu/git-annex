I see you're trying to run git-annex from termux having su'd to root
and that fails. (Not due to a missing env var, but due to HOME=/ and
android not letting root write to / apparently?!)

I don't know that chasing down that failure is a good use
of my time, because having tor installed system-wide on a rooted android
is not going to be a very common thing to do.

termux has a tor package, and with tor installed that way, its
configuration is in `$PREFIX/etc/tor/torrc` in the termux file tree,
and is writable by the termux user, without su.

Making enable-tor use that seems like a more fruitful avenue to pursue.
Utility/Tor.hs has a findTorrc function that could be modified to
find the termux torrc file. Other changes would also be needed for eg
torLibDir.
