I just tried moving the annex on the android phone to a different location, because I wasn't sure how git annex handles the /sdcard's fuse file system without symlinks...
So with the annex on the /data mount using ext I got a little further (and discovered a different problem <https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/problems_with_android_and_gpg/>).
