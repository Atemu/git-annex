git-annex has good support for running commands in parallel, but there
are still some things that could be improved, tracked here:

* Maybe support -Jn in more commands. Just needs changing a few lines of code
  and testing each.

* Maybe extend --jobs/annex.jobs for more control. `--jobs=cpus` is already
  supported; it might be good to have `--jobs=cpus-1` to leave a spare
  cpu to avoid contention, or `--jobs=remotes*2` to run 2 jobs per remote.

* Checksum verification is done in the cleanup stage job pool now for
  `git-annex get`, and `git-annex move --from` etc. But only for downloads.
  When an upload involves checksum verification, eg `git annex move --to` a
  removable drive, that checksum verification is done inside Remote.Git,
  and still runs in the perform stage job pool.
