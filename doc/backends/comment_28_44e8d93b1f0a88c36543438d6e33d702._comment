\"The risk that the content at an url might change varies over time or something like that, so I think it makes sense to treat URL keys as specially unstable.\" -- but, if I understand correctly, a URL key does not actually represent a URL?  Rather, a URL can be attached to _any_ key, and if the contents of some URLs claimed by a remote is unstable, such remotes should be marked as untrusted; while if the contents of a URL key is stored in a trusted remote, that contents is not unstable.  But URL and WORM keys are both \"unstable\" in that their contents can't be verified.  
[[todo/alternate_keys_for_same_content] could mitigate that.
