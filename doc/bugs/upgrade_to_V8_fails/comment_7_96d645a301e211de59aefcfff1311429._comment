Sorry for not being clear

for example /papers is a directory under git annex, 

a.pdf is a symlink to a file in the annex (annex filename abbreviated) as created by \"git-annex add\"

topic1/a.pdf  is another symlink to the same file in the annex           this is a copy of a.pdf, registered with \"git-annex add\"
topic1/a.pdf  is yet another symlink to the same file in the annex       this is another copy of a.pdf, registered with \"git-annex add\"

so the directory listing would look like this:

/papers/.git/annex/....
/papers/a.pdf          -> .git/annex/objects/pm/XX/SHA256E-s107393...

/papers/topic1/a.pdf   -> .git/annex/objects/pm/XX/SHA256E-s107393...
/papers/topic2/a.pdf   -> .git/annex/objects/pm/XX/SHA256E-s107393...

All of these symlinks point to the same file on disk under /papers/.git/annex/...
