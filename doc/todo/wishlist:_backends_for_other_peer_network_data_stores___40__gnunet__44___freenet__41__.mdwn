Apart from Tahoe-LAFS (covered by [[todo/tahoe lfs for reals]] and [[forum/tips: special_remotes/hook with tahoe-lafs]]), storage [[backends]] for other other [peer network data stores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_data_store#Peer_network_node_data_stores_2) would be interesting.

I mean gnunet, freenet, BitTorrent (also trackerless).

Before dropping a file locally, the BitTorrent client should check that all parts are still available from the peers.

Of course, there is no guarantee assumed that the content won't disappear from the peer network in future: they act more like a cache rather than an archive on whose lifespan you decide. (I'm only not sure about gnunet now: whether there is a rule of dropping unused content from it, like in freenet.)

Also networks like namecoin (derived from bitcoin) can be used as a key-value store. Despite being a peer network, a system like namecoin actually could offer the publisher more control over the lifespan of the content: he should be able to offer "financial" reward for others processing his key-value data. (But I'm not sure namecoin is designed reasonably for this reward system to work actually; but there might be appearing other similar systems.)
