It doesn't seem practical to get around the old git's OOM problem.
I think that the best thing to do is to not allow direct mode upgrade to v7 
until git has been upgraded.

The minimum git version is 2.22. Unfortunately, Debian stable shipped 2.20.
So direct mode users there who upgrade git-annex will need to also upgrade
git in order for git-annex to convert their repo -- and since the next
git-annex release drops support for direct mode, they'll have to upgrade
git (or downgrade git-annex) in order to use git-annex in their repo at all.
