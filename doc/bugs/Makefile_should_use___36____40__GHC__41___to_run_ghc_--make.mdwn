### Please describe the problem.
In line 32, Makefile runs "ghc --make Setup" which ignores the variable $(GHC).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Arch Linux doesn't ship with static libraries of ghc boot libraries by default, so I am passing GHC="ghc -dynamic" to Makefile, which sadly doesn't work as intended.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
7.20190730

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Sure！
