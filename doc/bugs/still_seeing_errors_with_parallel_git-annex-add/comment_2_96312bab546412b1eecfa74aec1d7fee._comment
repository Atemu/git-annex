I'll try to reproduce this and re-run under `strace`.  Maybe also, take another look at [[todo/add_tests_under_concurrency]]?  I think that re-running concurrent operations on a small repo many times should test all relevant operation interleavings, and bring out the concurrency-specific bugs.

With large repos, concurrency is the only way to make operations run in sane time.  So fixing this would help a lot.
