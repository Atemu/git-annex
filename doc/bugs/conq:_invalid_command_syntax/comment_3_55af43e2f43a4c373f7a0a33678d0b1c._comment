Yeah,  I saw those google links myself, but couldn't see why the bitbucket/ssh would be relevant.

The strange thing is that I *only* get this message when running git-annex.

I also don't have a conq in my path so I don't know where it is running from.
 

Oh well, if I ever sort it out I'll post back here.
