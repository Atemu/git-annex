### Please describe the problem.

Running "git clone git://git-annex.branchable.com/" in git-bash on Windows 7 fails with:

[[!format sh """
error: invalid path 'doc/bugs/Add_day_to_metadata./comment_1_d46d9f085b7077cc95d71628e45c231d._comment'
fatal: unable to checkout working tree
warning: Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.
You can inspect what was checked out with 'git status'
and retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'
"""]

I believe the failure is because "Add_day_to_metadata." (a path component with an empty extension) is invalid on Windows.

Because of this, developing and building on Windows is harder and more needlessly complicated than it should be.  Please rename the "doc/bugs/Add_day_to_metadata." directory along with the other directories whose names also end in a period (They can be found with "git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | grep '\./'").
### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Cloning the git-annex repository on Windows 7 â€” or any other Windows, I believe.
