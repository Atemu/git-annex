There are 139 files in this repo but this repos is updated very frequently (the files are generated every 10min).

After a lot of fight with cabal and cabal-dev, I've managed to make EKG run, here is a screenshotof the result after hours of run and an actual consumption of 33.8% of 8gb of ram.

But looking at it I don't know how it can be usefull. I don't know very well the haskell ecosystem, don't hesitate to point me to things that could help.

On a more positive note: git annex compiled from cabal (and from source) seems to eat my available memory way slower than the one from the ubuntu ppa.
