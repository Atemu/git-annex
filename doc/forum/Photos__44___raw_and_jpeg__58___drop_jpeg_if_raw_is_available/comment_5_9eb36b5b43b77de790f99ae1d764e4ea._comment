You could set the preferred content to not include files with that metadata, so they would be dropped by `git annex drop --auto` and not brought back by `git annex sync`.

git-annex still has to handle all those files and information related to them, manually or not, so it'll be just as slow. Not that 100K files is a lot to me anymore :P (my largest annex is in the 10s of millions..).
