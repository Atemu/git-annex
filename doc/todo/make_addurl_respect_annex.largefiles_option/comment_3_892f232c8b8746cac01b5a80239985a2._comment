 content="""
since there is no support for largefiles in addurl, is there ANY way to get idea either annex would have added a file to git or to annex if I do know the filename and its size?  pretty much a use-case is downloading/adding (small) .txt files to git, while the rest to annex in --fast (or --relaxed) mode.
If there is no way to query annex'es opinion given necessary information, I would have no ability to decide on my end without duplicating largefiles checking logic.
