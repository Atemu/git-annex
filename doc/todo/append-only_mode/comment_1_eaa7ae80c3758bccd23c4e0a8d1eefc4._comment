Thanks, that's a nice feature.

How could this be integrated with gitolite? Should the `if ( can_write($repo) )` branch be amended by a check for the \"+\" flag ([short documentation](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/conf-2/) says that \"RW\" is roughly \"create or fast-forward, no deletes\" while \"RW+\" includes deletes and non-fast-forwards)?

(This might change the user experience on repositories run with \"RW\" permissions currently, but IMO patching a possibly unwanted access that can be easily granted if so desired.)
