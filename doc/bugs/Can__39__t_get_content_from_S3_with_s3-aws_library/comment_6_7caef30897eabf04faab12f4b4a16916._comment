I reproduced the problem using the creds, and a modified version of
GetObject.hs from haskell-aws.

I had to upgrade from aws-0.9.2 to 0.11.4 to see the 301 redirect in the
debug mesages, but both versions seemed to fail the same way, it's just the
newer version added more debugging output.

There's an exception, which git-annex obscured:

	Response metadata: S3: request ID=5B5B9AE39E0C9729, x-amz-id-2=t6xToNbirPnwgEhTdbFr+Ncq5cGr3fMCRNq5WlFLjEk3ZJtan5aCotcsCS3GMTMgjsP/MNcOWUw=
	GetObject: HeaderException {headerErrorMessage = "ETag missing"}

I've seen this "ETag missing" before when an object was genuinely missing, but
I'm not sure what it indicates in this case.

This was using s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com. If I use southeast-2, it
just fails with "NoSuchKey". So I think that the 1-vs-2 was a red herring;
git-annex is using the right endpoint.

I have forwarded this bug report to: <https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/160>

It might be good to get in touch with the haskell-aws maintainer and provide the
creds so they can reproduce it too.
