\"you can expect the situation to be worse on 18.04 LTS\" -- if the default version there is before 7.20190912 there is no chance of user confusion, only versions 7.20190912 through 7.20191017 can cause it.  I take it it's not possible to change the default version included in existing distributions?  Sorry, don't know how Ubuntu/Debian packaging works...
