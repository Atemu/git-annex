Does the repository at /run/media/chymera/data0/data 
have an annex.uuid of 9f775012-942e-4ea7-96be-3bec8e4fcbf4 ?

Also, does that repository have the content of the file in it?
Running ls on the file in the working tree will not tell you that.

Easy way to answer both question is:
cd to the remote and run git-annex whereis on the file

(If the answer to either question is no, there's no bug.)
