I find amindfv's argument convincing: it is not good for new users of git-annex to feel that their git repo has been hijacked.  And, it is not good to break people's scripts.

On the other hand, Joey's arguments in favour of the change make sense.

So, having an easy way to turn the new git add behaviour on, but leaving it off by default, seems best.
