I have tried to reproduce this, and I can't seem to.

There's no network traffic involved in git-annex unused --from remote,
so I don't see how this can involve the S3 backend at all. If there's a bug
here, it should affect any kind of remote.

Are you sure you didn't forget to `git annex sync` before `git annex unused --from remote`?
If you have an old synced/master branch, that'll count as a user of the
file and so unused won't show it.

I think you'll need to provide a full transcript of how to make this problem
happen for me to get any further.
