What steps will reproduce the problem?

Attempting to pair between a local repository and a repository on a remote computer on my LAN. Pairing is initiated from my local machine and I'm interacting with the webapp on the remote machine via firefox running over an ssh -X connection. Pairing appears to work up to a point: I enter the secret at one end, the pairing request shows up at the other end. I then enter the secret at that end.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Pairing should complete successfully. Instead I get the error message "PairListener crashed: bad comment in public key", followed by the public key. The pairing process then does not move beyond the 'awaiting pairing' pages.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Local Machine: 3.20121127, Debian Wheezy/Sid (the only package from unstable is git-annex).
Remote Machine: 3.20121113, Arch Linux (I installed the version from: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex-bin/, which is supposedly the same as above, but reports the version specified here).

Please provide any additional information below.

None as yet. Let me know if there are any log files, etc. that I can post.
