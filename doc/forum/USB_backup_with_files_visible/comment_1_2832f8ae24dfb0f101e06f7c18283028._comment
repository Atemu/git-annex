This is not something the assistant really handles yet. The issue is that if you have a non-bare repository on the USB drive, something has to run `git annex sync` in it when changes are pushed to it, to update it to display the files that are in the repository.

One way to do this is to set up a non-bare repository by hand and add a git post-receive hook that runs `git annex sync`
