### Please describe the problem.

[Originally blamed datalad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/3685#issuecomment-533075845) but apparently `git annex add --json` does not include error message in the json output.  In our case it was due to permission issues.


[[!format sh """
$ git annex add more --json
  more: setFileMode: permission denied (Operation not permitted)
{"command":"add","success":false,"file":"more"}
git-annex: add: 1 failed
"""]]
