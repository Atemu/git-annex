### Please describe the problem.

git-annex does not check for the minimum version of Git that it requires, and therefore it sometimes uses flags which my installed Git does not recognize.
This happens when converting some indirect repositories to direct ones on an older server.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git annex direct


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 5.20131130

### Please provide any additional information below.
