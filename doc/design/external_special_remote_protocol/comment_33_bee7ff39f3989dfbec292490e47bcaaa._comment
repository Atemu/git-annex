@Ilya_Shlyakhter,

1. CHECKURL is only used by git-annex add/importfeed when adding a new url.
   So it does not need to be consistent with CHECKPRESENT, though it would
   probably make sense for it to be in most cases.
2. I guess you're asking if it should do that in its CHECKPRESENT
   implementation. CHECKPRESENT needs to use some method to actively verify
   that the remote currently contains the content of the key. It doesn't
   necessarily need to use a recorded url.
3. GETURLS looks at information stored in the git-annex branch. If the url
   key has been added to the repository with `git annex add` then its url
   will be stored there, but if you just generated an url key, it doesn't
   necessarily have anything stored about it in the git-annex branch.
