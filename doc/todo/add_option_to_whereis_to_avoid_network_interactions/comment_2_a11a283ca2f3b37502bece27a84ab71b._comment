gotcha... indeed, after allowing annex to fetch uuid for it and adjust .git/config it doesn't go over ssh during whereis.
I don't have a strong use case yet to further support --no-network or alike for whereis ATM so feel free  to close, but I am afraid it might bite me again later whenever I wouldn't expect any demand from annex/ssh for interactive prompts while running some command which doesn't usually require interaction (e.g. whereis) due to querying remote locations.
