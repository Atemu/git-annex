You seem to be the only one reporting this problem, and you have mentioned
seeing it multiple times. There must be something unusual in how you are
using git-annex.

A recent similar problem that was fixed in 
[[!commit 667d38a8f11c1ee8f256cdbd80e225c2bae06595]]
involved having multiple files with the same key. It would be good
to verify if the bug still occurs with the fixed git-annex, assuming you
have a way to reproduce this bug.

Without a way to reproduce it, all I can suggest is building git-annex with
the DebugLocks build flag (`stack build --flag DebugLocks`). That will make
it display a backtrace when the error occurs, assuming it's happening in
one of the places where debugging is enabled. If not, we'll have to
instrument more places in the code that use STM.

Also, redirecting all the output like you have done just risks hiding
a useful clue, so you should show the full regular console output
ideally w/o json enabled.

I have merged your other bug report about of `git annex fsck` with this one.
