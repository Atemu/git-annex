I have a git-annex importfeed of a bunch of podcasts that sometimes seems to
get stalled and hang forever on one of them.

It should be possible to time out the http requests in importfeed. Or even
move the work into git-annex transferrer like has been done for transfers.
Configurable by annex.stalldetection..
