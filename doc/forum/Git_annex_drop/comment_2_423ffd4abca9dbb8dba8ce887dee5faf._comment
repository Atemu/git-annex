If you pass git-annex the name of a file to operate on, and it does not
display the name of that file, the file is probably not an annexed file.

The other possibility would be that the file's content has *already* been
dropped. If git-annex sees there is nothing it needs to do to drop an
annexed file, it does not display anything either.

I suggest you run `git annex whereis` with the file. If it does not display
anything, it is not an annexed file. If it does display something, it will
probably tell you where the content of the file is, since it's not in the
local repository.
