the ``--all`` option works for this use case. That takes care of my problem. Thank you!

I can imagine other use cases where I'd want ``--from`` and ``--to`` at once, such as:

1.    same situation with my two bare external drives, but I want to only copy my audio-book collection to the new drive, and not my movies.

2.    I've got a large online storage (eg rsync.net) and want copy everything from there onto my new external drive.

I leave it up to your good judgement when/if this is worth doing.
