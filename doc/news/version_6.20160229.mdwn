git-annex 6.20160229 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Update perlmagick build dependency. Closes: #[789225](http://bugs.debian.org/789225)
   * Fix memory leak in last release, which affected commands like
     git-annex status when a large non-annexed file is present in the work
     tree.
   * fsck: When the only copy of a file is in a dead repository, mention
     the repository.
   * info: Mention when run in a dead repository.
   * Linux and OSX standalone builds put the bundled gpg last in PATH,
     so any system gpg will be preferred over it.
   * Avoid crashing when built with MagicMime support, but when the magic
     database cannot be loaded.
   * Include magic database in the linux and OSX standalone builds.
   * Fix memory leak when hashing files, which triggered during fsck
     when an external hash program was not used.
     (This leak was introduced in version 6.20160114.)
   * Support --metadata field&lt;number, --metadata field&gt;number etc
     to match ranges of numeric values.
   * Similarly, support preferred content expressions like
     metadata=field&lt;number and metadata=field&gt;number
   * The pre-commit-annex hook script that automatically extracts
     metadata has been updated to also use exiftool.
     Thanks, Klaus Ethgen."""]]
