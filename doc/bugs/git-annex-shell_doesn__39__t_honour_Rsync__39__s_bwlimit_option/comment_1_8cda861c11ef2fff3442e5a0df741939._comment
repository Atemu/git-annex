git-annex-shell cannot pass arbitrary rsync parameters through as specified by the client, because this would be a security hole (eg, allows overwriting or exposing arbitrary files). I'd have to pick out and whitelist safe parameters to make that work. 

I'm also not sure if rsync --server does anything with --bwlimit, it's more of a client side option. When rsync is connecting to a rsync:// server, it can't tell the server to run with --bwlimit, AFAIK.

Also, the bwlimit option works by stalling the connection occasionally, it's hardly very good and you'll sometime see it ramp back to full speed in between stalls.
