I suspect this might be the same underlying problem as [[bugs/Incorrect merge, direct repos (2)]]. However, I cannot reproduce it using the recipe given.. perhaps something was left out?

I wrote this shell script to try to codify the recipe in a runnable form:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
#!/bin/sh
set -e
mkdir test
cd test
git init a

cd a
git annex init
git annex direct
touch firstfile
git annex add firstfile
git annex sync # think this was left out of recipe

cd ..

git clone a b
cd b
git annex direct
echo bbbb > f
git annex add f
git annex sync || true
cd ..
cd a
echo aaaa > f
git annex add f
git annex sync
\"\"\"]]

At this point, a has 2 variants of f, and no amount of syncing in either repo will cause either variant to go away.
