It looks like the new lsof has broken/changed -F; the file descriptor field
is being showed even though -F0can does not request it.

IMHO this is a bug in lsof.

Additionally, the new lsof shows processes that have open pipes, even
when it's been asked to show only files under a given directory.

I've reported these problems upstream. Easy enough to work around in git-annex's parser.
