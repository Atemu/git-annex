This happens in Annex.MetaData.genMetaData. First it copies
metadata from the oldkey to the new key. Then it
calls addMetaData on the dateMetaData of the file's mtime.

In dateMetaData, there's a `filter isnew`, which makes
it filter out any of the date fields that already exist
in the metadata of the new key.

This was done intentionally, see 
[[!commit 8d5158fa3151be4c7fc698b96ed887b43ac48769]]
But that's lacking an explanation of why it was done.

Note that dateMetaData is also used in Command.ImportFeed
to convert a itempubdate into year and month metadata.
But changing its behavior to override old dates 
would not change that code path.

So, I don't see a problem with making this change, and have gone ahead and
done it.
