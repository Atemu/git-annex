`*` is not only used in annex.largefiles, but other pagespecs too.
Like preferred content:

	exclude=archive/*

So changing `*` to not match dotfiles would have wide reaching effects,
and it's really not good for different versions of git-annex to parse
preferred content expressions differently. And it seems too confusing to
have `*` match differently in annex.largefiles than in other pagespecs.

Having a single config that controls both kinds of adds still seems like a
good idea, but I don't know what that config should be.
annex.largedotfiles?
