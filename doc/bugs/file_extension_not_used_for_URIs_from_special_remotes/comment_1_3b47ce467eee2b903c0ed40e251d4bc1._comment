That would certianly be a bug, but I am not able to reproduce it. 

I used this external special remote program:

	#!/bin/sh
	set -e
	runcmd () {
		"$@" >&2
	}
	echo VERSION 1
	while read line; do
		set -- $line
		case "$1" in
			INITREMOTE)
				echo INITREMOTE-SUCCESS
			;;
			PREPARE)
				echo PREPARE-SUCCESS
			;;
			CLAIMURL)
				url="$2"
				echo CLAIMURL-SUCCESS
			;;
			CHECKURL)
				echo CHECKURL-CONTENTS 0 foo.gif
			;;
			TRANSFER)
				op="$2"
				key="$3"
				shift 3
				file="$@"
				case "$op" in
					STORE)
						echo TRANSFER-FAILURE STORE "$key" dummy
					;;
					RETRIEVE)
						touch "$file"
						echo TRANSFER-SUCCESS RETRIEVE "$key"
					;;
				esac
			;;
			CHECKPRESENT)
				key="$2"
				echo CHECKPRESENT-UNKNOWN "$key" dummy
			;;
			REMOVE)
				key="$2"
				echo REMOVE-SUCCESS "$key"
			;;
			*)
				echo UNSUPPORTED-REQUEST
			;;
		esac	
	done

That claims all urls, and provides an (empty) .gif file.

Result using it:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp>git init test
	Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/
	joey@darkstar:/tmp>cd test
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/test>git annex init

	lrwxrwxrwx 1 joey joey 186 Oct  4 15:01 foo.gif -> .git/annex/objects/Zp/QG/SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.gif/SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.gif

Which is as expected, and in the code it downloads the file to the worktree
and then ingests it from there, so it's handled the same way as a wget and
a git annex add would be.

It may be that older versions of git-annex behaved differently. I don't 
know what version you are using. Please always include a version number in
bug reports.
