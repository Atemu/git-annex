Thanks for the super quick response Joey.

That then sounds like `git add` and `git annex add` do get a performance impact (since they run smudge/clean which is not mandatory, or is no-op) even if I don't use unlock or adjust. Is that right? Is there a repo setting that will make it not use them?

My understanding is that git pre/post commit hooks are the ones that are useful for standard symlink approach and dont need smudge/clean at all. Please correct me if I am wrong.

Also, just want to say I appreciate all the effort that you do for this. I have tons of data managed with this and should probably write up that story of how I manage my files.
