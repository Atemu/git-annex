It's strange that git runs the clean filter on CLIPS/otherfile.txt and not
on the file it was asked to. But that is probably a red herring. Git gets
past that extraneouss file and on to bigfile.avi before it crashes.

The strace has a clone() and doesn't follow what happens in the child
process. I'm not clear what that child process is doing, although it seems
to involve the bigfile.avi that git is trying to mmap all into memory.
It would be good to strace -f and check what gets exec()ed.
