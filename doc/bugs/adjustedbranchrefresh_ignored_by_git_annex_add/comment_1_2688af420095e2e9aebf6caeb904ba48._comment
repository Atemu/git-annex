So I think the whole problem is that, git-annex add (and import, addurl,
etc) should add the files unlocked when in an unlockpresent branch.

I don't think git-annex sync needs to deal with this, problably.

Don't think this really has anything to do with adjustedbranchrefresh.
That's about updates after getting/dropping files, and that's not been done
in this case.
