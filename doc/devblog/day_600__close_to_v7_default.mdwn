Finished yesterday with elminating direct mode, removing another 200 lines of
code. I'm close to a decision on
[[updating repos to v7 by default|todo/v7_path_toward_default]]. Been 
reviewing open bugs that could impact the decision, taking a final look
at the code to make, and reaching out to people who might be affected.
