I also see `unfinished repository` in the assistant, but only at git remotes which don't have git-annex installed (f.e. gitlab). annex-ignore is set to true: `git config remote.gitlab.annex-ignore true`.

Clicking on `check status` says `Setting up this repository seems to have stalled! Make sure the remote system is available and retry`

git-annex version: 4.20130802-g1452ac3
