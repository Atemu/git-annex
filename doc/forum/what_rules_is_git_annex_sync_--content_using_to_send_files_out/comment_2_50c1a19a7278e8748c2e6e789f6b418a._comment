Hi Andrew!

Actually, you are entirely correct, I just misinterpreted the `smallarchive` formula.  What I was thinking it would do was it would upload the file in case there are not two copies in any combination of `archive` or `smallarchive` and as soon as there are two `archive` copies it would ideally drop the file if not in `*/archive/*` directory.

But now I see that the formula does exactly what you say it would do, the whole long `and not` condition is additional to the first, which means a file will not get uploaded if not in those directories.

I will play around with the expression, I'm sure it can be modified to do what I want.

Thanks!  It was mostly me being silly, sometimes having other people re-state the obvious helps!
