So I guess the answer here is to use \"cost\" to prioritize \"LAN-local\" repositories? Then we hit [[bugs/assistant_does_not_always_use_repo_cost_info_when_queueing_downloads]] but at least it will work in the general case...

I think that, in my case, it means doing:

    git config remote.origin.annex-cost 150

... so that it's somewhere between local repositories (100) and remote (200). Would that solve my issue here? I don't have many files to transfer right now so I can't really test this until I import new photos, but I'll give it a shot! :)

It would certainly be nice if git-annex was a little more clever with this - it could, for example, have a gray zone between \"remote\" and \"local\"... but I guess that's what the `annex-cost-command` is for...

Thanks!
