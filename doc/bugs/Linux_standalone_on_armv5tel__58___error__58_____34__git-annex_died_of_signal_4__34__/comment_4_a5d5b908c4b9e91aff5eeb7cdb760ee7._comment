Thank you for the great work done with `git-annex`!

I am not much familiar with how the Debian maintainers decide to address - or not - a bug/patch like this one. But if dropping a line to support the [related Debian Bug Report](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=928882) or subscribing to it could help, I invite everyone to do it. In my case, I have a 6TB RAID1 ARM Debian box meant to be used with `git-annex` but without it...
