This came up again in <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/local_caching_of_annexed_files/>
and there it was sufficient to configure remote.name.fetch so that no
branches were fetched from the cache remote.

Approach #3 can be implemented using:

	fetch = refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/private/nomerge/master

This prevents git-fetch from fetching the git-annex branch, and
it makes the remote master banch fetch into a name that
git-annex won't automatically merge into master.
