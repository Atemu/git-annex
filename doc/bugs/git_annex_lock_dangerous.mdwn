### Please describe the problem.

Git annex lock discards data without --force; this is misleading from the name.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git annex unlock something.txt
    kwrite something.txt # edit
    git annex lock something.txt # lock is the opposite of unlock, right?

Oops, just lost my changes!

If you want my opinion, `git annex lock` should either require `-f` to throw away data or should be renamed (e.g. to `revert` or `checkout`).

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git version 1.8.1.2, git-annex version: 4.20130815, Kubuntu 13.04
