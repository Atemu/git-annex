My goal for this month is to get more people using the git-annex assistant,
and fix issues that might be blocking you from using it. To do this,
I'd like to get an idea about whether you're already using it,
or what's keeping you from using it.

If you use `git-annex` at the command line and have no reason to use the
assistant, please instead fill in this poll on behalf of less technically
adept friends or family -- what's preventing you from introducing them to
the assistant?

[[!poll open=yes expandable=yes 0 "I'm using the assistant!" 3 "I need a Windows port" 4 "I need an Android port" 0 "I need an IPhone port (not holding my breath)" 0 "Well, it's still in beta..." 3 "I want to, but have not had the time to try it" 1 "Just inertia. I've got this dropbox/whatever that already works.." 0 "It's too hard to install (please say why in comments)" 2 "Perceived recent increase of bug reports and thus sitting it out." 4 "Initially the lack of direct-mode. Now concerns about the safety of direct mode. Perhaps after the next release."]]

Feel free to write in your own reasons, or add a comment to give me more info.
