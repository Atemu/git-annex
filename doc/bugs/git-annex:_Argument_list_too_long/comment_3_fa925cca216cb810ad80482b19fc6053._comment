Ok, I managed to get the transcript. It is located at <http://xgm.de/upload/transcript.log> (partly) resp. <http://xgm.de/upload/transcript.log.gz> (complete). Looks like the same script is executed again and again with an ever growing LD_LIBRARY_PATH argument list. The same happens when I simply run \"git-annex\" on the shell of the server. \"runshell\" standalone works fine.
