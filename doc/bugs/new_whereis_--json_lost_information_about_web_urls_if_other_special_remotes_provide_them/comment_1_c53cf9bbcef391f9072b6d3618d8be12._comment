The web urls were included in the json output, but it seems some json
parsers, including the one you're using, only show the last value of an
attribute when multiple values are repeated, as happened when there were
both web and other remotes with urls.

Anyway, I've updated the json output to include the url list inside the
remote's record.

(The "note" just collects any output that is not explicitly formatted as
json.)
