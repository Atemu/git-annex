It uses LMDB, which is a C library, and its PVar is a variable named by a
bytestring, so it's essentially a key/value store where the values can be
arbitrary Haskell data types. Since git-annex already has Keys, and most
of the need for the database is to look up some cached value for a Key,
this seems like a pretty good fit!

Unfortunately, "A VCache file may be opened by only one process at a time,
and only once within said process."

But, git-annex needs multiple read-only access, as many git-annex processes
can run concurrently.
