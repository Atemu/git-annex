A common use case for me is to use annex as really just an addition to git to store additional content.  What I am ending up with is two stage procedure to submit my changes to our shared repository:  git push REMOTE; git annex copy --to=REMOTE . IMHO it would only be logical if there was "git annex push REMOTE [GITPUSHOPTIONS]" which would be merely an alias for "git push REMOTE [GITPUSHOPTIONS]; git annex copy --to=REMOTE" but which will make use of annex for such common usecase simple(r)
