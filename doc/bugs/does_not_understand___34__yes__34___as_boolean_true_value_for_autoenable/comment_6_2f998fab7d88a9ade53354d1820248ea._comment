I've made the git-config parser support all the ways of indicating true and
false that git documents, including the strange distinction between an empty
config setting (false) and no config setting (true). I'm not going to
chase undocumented git behavior that could vary between versions of git.

That also made it support values like "on" that are set by
git-annex config --set. It was always possible to set such things.
Older git-annex will display an error message if used with a repo
that has such values set. That seems acceptable.

I have not done anything about making special remote configs consistent.
