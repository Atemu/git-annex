Installing 7.20190912 from the \"ancient\" tarball at https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-i386-ancient.tar.gz on an x86 Synology NAS, I get

$ git annex merge

  Git is older than version 2.22 and so it has a memory leak that affects using unlocked files. Recommend you upgrade git before unlocking any files in your repository.
merge git-annex ok
git-annex: thread blocked indefinitely in an MVar operation

$ which git
/var/services/homes/michael/git-annex.linux/git

$ /var/services/homes/michael/git-annex.linux/git --version
git version 2.1.4

Seems like included git is too old then?
