Could there be separate `annex.git-add.largefiles` and `annex.git-annex-add.largefiles` settings, applying to files added via `git add` and `git annex add`, respectively?  If not given, their value defaults to the value of `annex.largefiles`.

Reason: to prevent `git add` from inadvertently adding annexed files in unlocked form, I set `* annex.largefiles=nothing` at repo root; but then, `git annex add` won't annex anything either, unless specifically asked.   I want to use `git add` to add files to git only (since it can't add them to git-annex in locked form), and to use `git annex add` to add files to either git or annex based on `annex.git-annex-add.largefiles` setting.
