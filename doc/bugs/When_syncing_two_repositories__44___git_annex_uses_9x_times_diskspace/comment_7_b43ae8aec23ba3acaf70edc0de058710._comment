    Ok, quick question: Should I issue git config gc.auto 0, in both repositories? 
    (it puts variable inside .git/config)

    With this gc.auto 0, should the \"typechange: \" logging change? (because it still in the log)

    I'm testing the whole experience, and report back, 
    also when new build is available i will switch to it, to report about the logging size.

Thank you for your fast response!
