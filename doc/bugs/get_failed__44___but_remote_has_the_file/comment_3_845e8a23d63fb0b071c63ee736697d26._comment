Wait, that's weird, it works today.  I'm thinking that maybe there was another copy of `git-annex` backgrounded and holding a lock, since that reproduces this behavior:

    pilot:~/vid/tv/Show$ git annex get --from bucket Show\ -\ S03E08.mp4
    get Show - S03E08.mp4 (from bucket...) 
    Enter passphrase for key '/home/jim/.ssh/id_rsa': 
    SHA256E-s358393024--efda17d23d68b85d47ad342f8e41f79ac04d4a65d7ef654b4838b995b86bdefe.mp4
        96043008  26%   10.27MB/s    0:00:24  ^Z
    [1]+  Stopped                 git annex get --from bucket Show\ -\ S03E08.mp4
    pilot:~/vid/tv/Show$ git annex get --from bucket Show\ -\ S03E08.mp4
    get Show - S03E08.mp4 failed
    git-annex: get: 1 failed

So, I guess this is probably \"not a bug\", but having a more specific error would be really helpful.
