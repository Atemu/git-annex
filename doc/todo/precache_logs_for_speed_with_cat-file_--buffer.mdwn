that ls-files the worktree may be sped up by using cat-file --buffer
to get location logs (and maybe other logs) more efficiently,
and precache them.

Another thing that the same cat-file --buffer approach could be used with
is to cat the annex links. Git.LsFiles.inRepoDetails provides the Sha
of file contents, which can be fed through cat-file --buffer to get keys.
A complication is that, non-symlinks could be large files that are not
annexed but in git; don't want to cat those when looking for annex links.
That would probably need pre-filtering through a cat-file --buffer that
only gets the size of the blob, not its content.

Some calls to lookupKey remain, and the above could
be used to remove them and make it faster. The ones in Annex.View and
Command.Unused seem most likely to be able to be converted.

Also, limits that look up keys still do a key lookup, before the key is
looked up efficiently. (Before these changes, the same key lookup was done
2x too..) Avoiding that would speed up --in etc, probably another 1.5x-2x
speedup when such limits are used. What that optimisation needs is a way to
tell if the current limit needs the key or not. If it does, then match on
it after getting the key (and precaching the location log for limits that
need that), otherwise before getting the key.
