Afterthought on the immediately preceding comment - if the intention of `unannex` is to reverse `add`, then IMHO `unadd` or `undo-add` seem like more logical choices.  Renaming to one of these would free up `unannex` for the conversion use case.  But I appreciate that this is potentially confusing for users already used to `unannex`'s current behaviour, so I expect the idea will be rejected.
