### Please describe the problem.

Installing git-annex via the Makefile results in a zsh completion installed to `$(PREFIX)/$(SHAREDIR)/zsh/vendor-completions`

This is not used by zsh, since the builtin zsh fpath is `$(PREFIX)/$(SHAREDIR)/zsh/site-functions` -- as a result, zsh completions do not work.

Some system distributions of zsh may change the builtin fpath, in which case git-annex may have working zsh completions out of the box -- I believe the current installation method is designed based on Debian's preferred layout.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Install git-annex on a non-Debian system

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

version 7.20190730 on an Arch Linux system.

### Recommended fix

Make the installation directory configurable. Use /etc/os-release to check if the system is a Debian-based system, and if so, continue to use vendor-completions, if not, use site-functions.
