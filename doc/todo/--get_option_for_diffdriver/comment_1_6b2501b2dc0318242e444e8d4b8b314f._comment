This is a good idea. I wonder what to do about the objects it downloads for
a diff; should they be left in the annex for later use/dropunused, or
immediately deleted after the diff completes. 

My inclination is to keep
them around, for one thing when I'm diffing stuff I often run diff more
than once, perhaps to widen the diff or because I want to take a second
look at it, and re-downloading a bunch of big files would be painful then.

By the way, what diffdriver program are you using? I've had a hard time
finding any real-life examples of git diffdrivers.
