In case the problem is fixed in a newer ghc than the 7.4.1 used to build the debian backport and the standalone builds, I have made a standalone build with 7.6.3, which is temporarily here: <http://tmp.kitenet.net/git-annex-standalone-i386.tar.gz> ff3e8a3c35301c8a625747f98435fe427be17f47345540f537ff47f6fc97bdb6

(That's a i386 build, which will also run on amd64. That could also be a difference as AFAICS it's only been reported happening with amd64 builds (although I was not able to reproduce the problem on amd64))
