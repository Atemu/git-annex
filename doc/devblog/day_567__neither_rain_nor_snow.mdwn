Offline today due to weather, but there's lots of nice backlog to work
on...

I've written down a [[todo/external_remote_querying_transition]] plan.
If you maintain an external special remote that implements WHEREIS or
GETINFO, please take a look as your code would need to be updated if this
is done.

Ilya suggested making `git annex testremote` be able to test readonly
remotes, and I implemented that.

There was a discussion in the forum about .git/annex/misctmp/
containing cruft left by an interrupted git-annex process.
I was surprised to find half a gigabyte of old files on my own laptop due
to this problem. I've put in a fix, so git-annex will clean up such temp
files that were left behind by a previous interrupted git-annex process.
