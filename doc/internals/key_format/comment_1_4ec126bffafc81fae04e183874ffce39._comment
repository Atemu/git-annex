Are there limitations on the character set git-annex guarantees?

It appears from experiments that git-annex only uses ASCII characters in there, given both a file 'test.extü' (in UTF-8 encoding) 'test.ext\xff' produced extension-free key names in the SHA256E hash – but it'd be good to have that confirmed.
