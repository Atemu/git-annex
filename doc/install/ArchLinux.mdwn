There are four non non-official packages for git-annex in the Arch Linux User Repository. Any of these may be installed manually per [AUR guidelines](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_User_Guidelines#Installing_packages) or using a wrapper such as [`yaourt`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/yaourt) shown below.

1. The simplest method is to use the [git-annex-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex-bin/) package based on the [prebuilt Linux tarballs](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/). This package includes many of the binary shims from the pre-built package. Although common Linux system utilities have been stripped in favor of normal dependencies, the pre-configured Haskell libraries included out of the box make this an easy install. The disadvantage is the resulting installation is a bit on the heavy side at nearly 100M.

       $ yaourt -Sy git-annex-bin

2. A more traditional source package is available at [git-annex](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex/). This depends on a large number of Haskell packages available from a third party repository or through Cabal. You must either enable a 3rd party repo that has the dependencies or have a working Cabal installation. Unless you know what you are doing this is a bit problematic and some intervention may be required to get this option to work. The state of available dependency versions also varies so this may not work at all times.

       $ yaourt -Sy git-annex

3. A development package is available at [git-annex-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex-git/) that functions similarly to the source package but builds directly from the HEAD of the git repository rather that the last official release.

       $ yaourt -Sy git-annex-git

4. A Cabal sandbox build is also available

       $ yaourt -Sy git-annex-cabal

Finally you may choose to forgo the Arch Linux package system entirely and install git-annex directly through cabal.

    $ pacman -S git rsync curl wget gnupg openssh cabal-install
    $ cabal update
    $ cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin
