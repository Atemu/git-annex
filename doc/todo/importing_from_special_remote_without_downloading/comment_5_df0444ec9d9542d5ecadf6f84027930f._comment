Hmm, it would also be possible for a remote to generate a WORM key,
as long as there was a way for it to get a timestamp for the file being
imported.

That might let it be implemented for several other special remotes.

Although I'm wary about making git-annex ever use WORM without being
explicitly asked to. annex.eatworms? ;)
