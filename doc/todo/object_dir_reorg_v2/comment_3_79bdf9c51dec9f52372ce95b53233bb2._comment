What is the potential time-frame for this change? As I am not using git-annex for production yet, I can see myself waiting to avoid any potential hassle.

Supporting generic metadata seems like a great idea. Though if you are going this path, wouldn't it make sense to avoid metastore for mtime etc and support this natively without outside dependencies?
