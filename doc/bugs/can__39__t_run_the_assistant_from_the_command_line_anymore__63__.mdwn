What steps will reproduce the problem?

just compiled the latest version of git annex from git, checkout hash was c9c0042

Tried running the assistant from the command line, got unexpected error

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected assistant to start, instead got:

    annex$  git annex assistant
    git-annex: watch mode is not available on this system


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

annex$  git annex version
git-annex version: 3.20130103
local repository version: 3
default repository version: 3
supported repository versions: 3
