    Running on Android.. Adding git-annex to PATH for you, and tuning for optimal behavior.

That means it should have updated ~/.profile to set PATH appropriate.

The problem is the new git-annex-install script, when it exits, dumps the
user back into the shell they were in before, and that shell has not gotten
its path updated. And without sourcing the download script into the current
shell, it has no way to update the path. 

I suppose the best thing is to ask the user to source the script, and then
the script can set PATH. Which I've now done.
