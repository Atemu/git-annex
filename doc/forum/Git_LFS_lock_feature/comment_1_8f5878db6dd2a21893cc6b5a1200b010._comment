git-lfs is a centralized system with a server that can manage the locks.
git-annex is generally not, and so I do not think it's possible to
implement locks of that kind generally, for the same reason git does not
support file locking itself, while contralized VCS systems often do.

However, if you wanted something like git-lfs's behavior of preventing
pushes that modify files locked by another user, it could be
implemented as a pre-receive hook on a centralized git server. You would
only need some way to register the locks to the server, for the pre-receive
hook to check.
