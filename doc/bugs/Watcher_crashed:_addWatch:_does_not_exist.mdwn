### Please describe the problem.

When starting an git annex webapp in my documents repository, i get the error message, that the watcher thread has died. The error message seems to be arising from the fact, that a watcher thread for an empty string should be started, which does not work.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I've no idea, how to reproduce this in another repostory.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

ii  git-annex  4.20130709   i386   manage files with git, without checking their contents into git

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log
