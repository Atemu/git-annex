> This way, if a file has a staged change, it gets committed, and then that commit is reverted, resulting in another commit. Which a later run of undo can in turn revert. If it didn't commit, the history about the staged change that was reverted would be lost.

so far, my experience with this is that unstaged changes get dropped and the change that gets undoed is the last committed change. In other words, if i have:

    $ git annex status
    M file

`git annex undo` is going to drop that modification and `git revert HEAD`. but maybe i got confused, in which careÂ some of the documentation i just did in [[direct mode]] needs to be corrected. --[[anarcat]]
