I belive I have found a regression.

Inspired by 
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/performance_improvement:_git_on_ssd__44___annex_on_spindle_disk/>
I tried to only have .git/annex/objects (also tested moving .git/annex) on NFS while having the rest on local SSD disk.

But when trying to add files i get:

     > git annex add testfile
    add testfile (checksum...) 
    git-annex: testfile: rename: unsupported operation (Invalid cross-device link)
    failed
    git-annex: add: 1 failed

I have tried both using bind-mount and with a sym-link.
