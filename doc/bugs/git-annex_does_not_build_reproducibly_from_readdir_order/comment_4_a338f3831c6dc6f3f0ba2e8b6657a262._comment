That is closer, but those diffs in Assistant/WebApp/Types.o seem to still be something different.

Since strings in Types.o varied around the embedded static/activityicon.gif, I noticed that Assistant/WebApp/Types.hs had lines like

```
publicFiles \"static\"
staticRoutes = $(embed \"static\")
```

Could it be, that those indirectly iterate over listings of the static/ dir without sorting to generate those lists of filenames embedded in Types.o?

Maybe via <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-static> ?
e.g. <https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/blob/master/yesod-static/Yesod/Static.hs#L250> . That file has more occurrences of fs and none of sort.
