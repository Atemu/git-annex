What steps will reproduce the problem?

I don't know how, but this happened already a second time, I don't know how to reproduce this yet.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

There are many three character name directories created that look like the parts of a hash - and each contains a logfile.

    % ls
    027
    1d1
    1e3
    232
    36e
    583
    5f6
    69c
    9ea
    bd7
    c46
    d20
    d48
    f31
    f88
    uuid.log
    [+the intended data directories]

    % find 027/
    027/
    027//b73
    027//b73/SHA256-s10108928--3c3766aed8b66de9d0ef37820e0ddfba25f9463b37f30e25ceb5ce3cdf12db36.log
