Seems unlikely to be fixed in wheezy any case, since I doubt it's possible to backport ghc without backporting the entire haskell ecosystem.

I should probably look at upgrading git-annex's linux autobuilders from stable to testing, although IIRC last time some people had ancient kernels and testing's libc didn't work.

Old systems suck.
