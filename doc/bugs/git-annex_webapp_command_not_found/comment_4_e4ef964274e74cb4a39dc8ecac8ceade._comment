As soon as I removed my single repository it never loaded again.  I have re-booted.  re-installed.   I have the package installed it tries to load but doesn't.   I have the stand-alone installed it does nothing.    Only if I try to execute webapp as superuser does it launch the browser but doesn't execute properly. comes up to some url file://???     when it was working properly i noticed it was opening to locahost url 127.0.0.1/something

Still seems to be running on my desktop machine though.  But i did not try to remove the repository from that machine because git-annex does not provide a way to remove repository without actually deleting the files.   Evidently Disable and Delete do exactly the same thing.

Any ideas?  thanks. Mike
