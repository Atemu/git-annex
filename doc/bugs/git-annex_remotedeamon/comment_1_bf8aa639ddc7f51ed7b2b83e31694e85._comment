Please use descriptive bug titles.

The webapp configures some common use cases, not every possible use case. Running git-annex assistant on a remote server to keep a directory there updated is not a relatively common use case. You can do it if you want; and if someone provided a very complelling UI markup that made sense to regular users it might be added to the webap (but this seems unlikely. 

As it is, the webapp set up bare git repositories on remotes, because that is by far the most common useful way to use git on a remote server. And if the webapp's local pairing interface is used, two existing non-bare client repositories will be paired, and the new remotedaemon will help keep the in sync.
