It seems to me that you need to tell git-annex the publicurl to use to
download files from this S3 remote. That's the url to the top of the S3
bucket. Run `git annex enableremote publics3 publicurl=...' and push,
and it should then become available in every clone.

The documentation for publicurl says it's enabled by default when
public=yes, but AFAICS it's never actually done that. And I'm not sure I
want to hardcode those urls into git-annex. I've updated the documentation
instead.
