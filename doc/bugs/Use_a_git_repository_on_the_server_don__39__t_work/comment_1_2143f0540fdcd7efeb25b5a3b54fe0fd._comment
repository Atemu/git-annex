Well, it works here. It checks that all of `git`, `rsync`, and `git-annex` are in the path on the remote server using `which`.

I think the most likely reason would be if you've installed git-annex on the remote server but not in the PATH. If you're using the standalone tarball, for example, it's \"installed\", but it has no way to find it.

Or, you could have installed from cabal, which puts it in ~/.cabal/bin or ~/bin or something like that, and perhaps you configured your shell to put that directory in the PATH, but you did it in a way that only works for login shells. If you set the PATH in `~/.bashrc`, for example, that would not work for a noninteractive shell.
