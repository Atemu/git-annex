Until version 5.201508125, --time-limit didn't cause a clean shutdown,
and so the fsck database didn't get updated with the last files it checked.
This could result in up to 1000 files being checked over again the next
time the incremental fsck was run.

I can't reproduce the problem you describe with the current version.
And your transcript seems to be showing the old version, which was known to
have this problem. Only reason I'm not closing this bug immediately
is you seem to have a new enough version on your mac to avoid the problem..
but it's not clear to me if you're experiencing the problem on the mac.
