I am still suffering from the same problem, git-annex versions are:
laptop git-annex version: 8.20210223
server git-annex version: 8.20200330

Also as soon as there is a bit more something to be synced the repositories frequently need to be repaired, which on the server takes days for this 130GB repo.

Anything I can do to help debug this?
