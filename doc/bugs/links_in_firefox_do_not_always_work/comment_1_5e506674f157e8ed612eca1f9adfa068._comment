Thanks, that's very interesting indeed.

When I was debugging this on Windows, I had the network console open, and could see clearly that Firefox was trying to load \"/\" when I clicked on a link to \"/config\". Both firefox and the git-annex webapp's debug log agreed that it asked for the wrong page.

I have just reproduced it using iceweasel as well. I know that I have tested git-annex before under iceweasel and it seemed to work.

Seems that clicking 3+ times on a link makes it finally follow it.

I wonder if this has something to do with the long polling. Disabling javascript would avoid it if so. They've made disabling JS in firefox sufficiently hard that I cannot find how to do it.

Also, the problem seems to open happen on the main page (/). Once I get to any other page, further links are followed without trouble.
