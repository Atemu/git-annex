For the default git-annex will pass plenty of key bytes to make this unnecessary. True, one could adjust <code>$HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf</code> to select another s2k algorithm and another cipher for the data (the two relevant options being <code>s2k-digest-algo</code> and <code>cipher-algo</code>. To be honest, I'd also like a per-repository gpg options setting for the symmetric cipher. For instance I know that I always want compression with gpg unless I use it with annexed data (at least in certain repositories).
