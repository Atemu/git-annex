Thanks for the heads up. 

As far as I can see, the necessary libraries are included in the standalone build. So it should work when used as intended via `runshell`.

But that's not what the AUR is doing. It's binary editing (!!) the git-annex binary to use different library sonames, and taking the git-annex binary and dropping it unprotected into a system it was not built for to fend for itself. 
That strikes me as a technique that is unlikely to continue working, and one that I cannot commit to support.

I don't want to cause you Arch people unnecessary work, but building a 64 bit standalone build every time I release git-annex is unnecessary work on my part, as long as the 32 bit one works everywhere when used as designed. If someone has to do this 64 bit build, why not you? This would also avoid any further breakage, since you could build it against the actual library sonames it's going to be used with on Arch.
