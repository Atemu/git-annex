I'm honestly concerned about this. It sounds like compatibility with people who don't have git annex installed will go from being on by default, to off by default.

I really do not want my text files to be annexed by default. It would be great to at least have a much easier way to restore the old behavior.

Also, it sounds like if I did the default behavior and annexed all of my files, I would not have to put a lot more effort into thinking about where all of my files are. Right now, my smaller files are going to be cloned by default, and if I need larger files, I can get them.

But now, I will have to select all of the files I want after each clone, it appears? Even if I specify what files I want with --get, it is still more work and effort than just having the old behavior.

Basically, files tracked with git were \"pinned\", and files in the annex were optional. I understand that there are ways to get most of this functionality back, but, it would appear to still take more effort than the existing functionality.

Finally, I really hope you reconsider putting git in the back seat. It is invaluable that others can interact with my repos without having to have git annex installed, and without my having to take any extra steps. I only started using git annex because it so painlessly integrated with git. I love being able to share my repos that contain annexed files with others who haven't installed git annex.

Thanks for your work joey. I understand the technical reasons you did this. I hope you'll reconsider this.
