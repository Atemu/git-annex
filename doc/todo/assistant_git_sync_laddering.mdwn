When the [[design/assistant]] is running on a pair of remotes, I've seen
them get out of sync, such that every pull and merge results in a conflict,
that then has to be auto-resolved. 

This seems similar to the laddering problem described in this old bug:
[[bugs/making_annex-merge_try_a_fast-forward]]
