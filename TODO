* bug when annexing files in a subdir of a git repo
* how to handle git mv file?

* if the annexed files were in .git/annex/<backend>/key, and 
  files in the repo symlink to that, the .git-annex/key/<file>.<backend>
  would be redundant, and not needed 

     -- no separate merge problem with it
     -- want to add an url? `ln -s .git/annex/<backend>/http:%%kitenet.net%foo myfile`

* implement retrieval for backendfile

* query remotes for their annex.uuid settings

* hook up LocationLog
* --push/--pull/--want/--drop

* finish BackendUrl and BackendChecksum
