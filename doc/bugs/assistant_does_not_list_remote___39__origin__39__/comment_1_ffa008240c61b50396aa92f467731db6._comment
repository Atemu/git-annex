The remotes were not listed because git-annex-shell was not working (found in the path, however necessary *.so files were not found).

Now all remotes are listed. `.git/config` is ok, with the uuid listed. `git annex status` returns all.

However sync is not working. The webapp on the workstation states that it has synced with the server, however `ls` on the server returns empty. The server is set as archive, the workstation as client.
