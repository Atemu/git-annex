   * Amazon S3 is now supported as a special type of remote.
     Warning: Encrypting data before sending it to S3 is not yet supported.
   * Note that Amazon S3 support is not built in by default on Debian yet,
     as hS3 is not packaged.
   * fsck: Ensure that files and directories in .git/annex/objects
     have proper permissions.
   * Added a special type of remote called a directory remote, which
     simply stores files in an arbitrary local directory.
   * Bugfix: copy --to --fast never really copied, fixed."""]]
