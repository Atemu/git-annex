I was exporting (with exporttree) to a directory remote on an external ext4 formatted USB drive.
As is usually the case, there was permission problem. My current user did not have write permission for one directory I was exporting to.
git-annex just printed \"failed\" after it actually completed the file transfer with 100%.
Even with --verbose and --debug I could not figure out the problem until I discovered the permission problem.
