### Please describe the problem.

Since upgrading to `6.20180626-gdf91a5cff` (pre-built OS X binary on OS X 10.11) it appears `git annex importfeed` is unable to properly download a RSS feed from one particular site -- it gets back `400 Bad Request` from the website, and then unsurprisingly reports `warning: bad feed content; no enclosures to download`.  The relevant RSS feed appears sane when downloaded from the same URL with `wget` or `curl`.  The previous `git-annex` version I was using on this machine (before the security update), `6.20170320-g41c5d9d` was able to download this RSS feed (I realise that's a rather large window of changes!).

It appears the older version (`6.20170320-g41c5d9d`) used `wget` to download the podcast RSS, and the newer version (`6.20180626-gdf91a5cff`) seems to fetch the RSS internally in a way that does not work with this RSS feed (nor does the newer version appear to provide debug output of what it is doing at that step that goes wrong, unlike the previous version which shows the explicit `wget` command run, even if multiple `--debug` and/or `--verbose` options are provided).

All other podcast RSS feeds work on both versions.

As best I can tell from packet captures and `telnet` debugging, the issue is that the new `git annex importfeed` does not send a `User-Agent:` header.  Possibly some anti-DoS/anti-spam front end is rejecting it as a result?

Can a suitable `User-Agent:` header be added to the `git annex importfeed` HTTP requests?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Attempt to `git annex importfeed` the feed `'https://theythempodcast.com/episodes?format=RSS'`.  The problem also appears reproducible with `'http://theythempodcast.com/episodes?format=RSS'` (ie, unencrypted), which makes debugging a wee bit simpler (ie, packet captures can help).

Failing, on `6.20180626-gdf91a5cff`:

In both cases the `TEMPLATE` value is the same one I've used for years, and works with all the other podcast feeds:

    ewen@ashram:~/Music/podcasts$ set | grep TEMPLATE
    TEMPLATE='archive/${feedtitle}/${itemtitle}${extension}'

Note that the only addition was adding a `User-Agent:` header (copied from the `wget` request).  The redirect to HTTPS is expected here, as we are initially requesting via HTTP for `telnet`s benefit (I did try to get `openssl s_client` working, but it appeared the TLS connection timed out before I could manually complete a request, and I had no luck piping the request into `openssl s_client`).

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Absolutely :-)  `git annex` has been my podcatcher, and media management tool for years.  Thanks for writing it!
