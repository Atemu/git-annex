git-annex now has experimental support for tuning a repository for
different work loads. 

For example, a repository with a very large number of files in it may work
better if git-annex uses some nonstandard hash format, for either the
`.git/annex/objects/` directory, or for the log files in the git-annex
branch.

A repository can currently only be tuned when it is first created; this is
done by passing `-c name=value` parameters to `git annex init`.

For example, this will make git-annex use only 1 level for hash directories
in `.git/annex/objects`:

	git -c annex.tune.objecthashdirectories=1 annex init

It's very important to keep in mind that this makes a nonstandard format
git-annex repository. In general, this cannot safely be used with
git-annex older than version 5.20150128. Older version of git-annex will
not understand and will get confused and perhaps do bad things.

Also, it's not safe to merge two separate git repositories that have been
tuned differently (or one tuned and the other one not). git-annex will
prevent merging their git-annex branches together, but it cannot prevent
`git merge remote/master` merging two branches, and the result will be ugly
at best (`git annex fix` can fix up the mess somewhat).

Again, tuned repositories are an experimental feature; use with caution!

The following tuning parameters are available:

* `annex.tune.objecthashdirectories` (default: 2)  
  Sets the number of hash directories to use in `.git/annex/objects/`

* `annex.tune.objecthashlower` (default: false)
  Set to true to make the hash directories in `.git/annex/objects/` use
  all lower-case.

* `annex.tune.branchhashdirectories` (default: 2)
  Sets the number of hash directories to use in the git-annex branch.

Note that git-annex will automatically propigate these setting to
`.git/config` for tuned repsitories. You should never directly change
these settings in `.git/config`
