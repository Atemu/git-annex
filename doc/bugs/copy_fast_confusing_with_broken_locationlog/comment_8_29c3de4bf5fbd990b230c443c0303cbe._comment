What you're describing should be impossible; the error message shown can only occur if the object is present in the annex where `git-annex-shell recvkey` is run. So something strange is going on.

Try reproducing it by running on the remote system, `git-annex-shell recvkey /remote/repo.git $key` .. if you can reproduce it, I guess the next thing to do will be to strace the command and see why it's thinking the object is there.
