Just FYI, to get git-annex on nixos detected, I added the following to $HOME/.ssh/rc (mode rw-------):

    PATH=/home/patrick/bin:/home/patrick/.nix-profile/bin:/run/current-system/sw/bin

And as aliases are not expanded, I also added a 'which' command in my bin directory:

    #!/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash
    type -P $@
