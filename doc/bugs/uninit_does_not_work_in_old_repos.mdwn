As uninit does not need to actually write out any data, just remove it, it should be possible to uninit in old stores.

    % git annex uninit
    git-annex: Repository version 2 is not supported. Upgrade this repository: git-annex upgrade

If the repo happens to be broken, this essentially locks in data.
