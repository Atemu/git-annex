Could it be some general issue with setCreds?

The reason I'm wondering is that megaannex isn't really working. It doesn't seem to (properly) get the credentials so it's acting funny and getting an Invalid Argument exception where, according to what I understand from the documentation, it shouldn't be possible to get an Invalid Argument exception.

Ofcourse I have contacted the maintainer of megaannex (TobiasTheViking on github) too. I've also started looking in to it myself.
