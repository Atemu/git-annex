### Please describe the problem.

When `git annex direct` is interrupted (either through a power outage or deliberate `control-c`) it may leave the repository in an inconsistent state.

A typical situation is `git-annex` believing that the repo is in `indirect` mode while the files are not symlinks anymore.

I believe I have described this problem here before, but the bug report was deleted as part of the may 29th purge (222f78e9eadd3d2cc40ec94ab22241823a7d50d9), file `doc/bugs/git_annex_indirect_can_fail_catastrophically.mdwn`.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

`git annex direct` on a large repository, `control-c` before it finishes.

Observe how a lot of files are now considered to be in the famous [[typechange status|forum/git-status_typechange_in_direct_mode/]] in git.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20140717 on Debian Jessie.

### Please provide any additional information below.

I wish i could resume the `git annex direct` command, but this will do a `git commit -a` and therefore commit all those files to git directly. It still seems to me that `git annex` should never run `git commit -a` for exactly that kind of situations.

I think that's it for now. -- [[anarcat]]
