Well, it makes sense for addurl run on a file that is not an annexed file to
fail. There is nothing else it could do in that case that makes sense.
It can't record that the youtube url is a location for the annexed file,
because there is no annexed file.

What you can do is git-annex addurl --relaxed with the youtube url,
which does not download it, and then make git-annex treat the mp4 file
as the content, by running git-annex reinject with the first parameter
being the git-annex filename, and the second being the f.mp4, which will
get moved into the annex.

	git-annex addurl --file youtube.vid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKge  --relaxed
	git-annex reinject f.mp4 youtube.vid

Note that this command will work no matter what the content of the first file
is, it will accept anything due to the use of --relaxed. So it's up to you
to make sure you use it with a file that's the same content as the youtube
video.
