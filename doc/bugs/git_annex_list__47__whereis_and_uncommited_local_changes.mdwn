### Please describe the problem.

I’m not sure whether this is a bug or a technical limitation, but here
you go: In direct mode, if a file is locally changed but unsynced,
«git annex whereis» and «git annex list» behave as if the file were
still unchanged. Any changes would only show after «git annex sync» or
«git annex add» (altough I’m not sure what the latter does if a file
is already annexed).

Syncing prior to «whereis» is not viable since I might not want to
proliferate the changes to other remotes. Would it be reasonable making
sure that «whereis» considers uncommitted local changes?

If doing so is too expensive to do implicitly, it would be useful
having an explicit means of seeing local changes in direct mode
repositories. Is «git annex add» the intended way of doing so?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Clone A to B.
2. Get file $f from A to B.
3. Switch B to direct mode.
4. Edit file $f.
5. «git annex list» reports that $f is on both A and B.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
