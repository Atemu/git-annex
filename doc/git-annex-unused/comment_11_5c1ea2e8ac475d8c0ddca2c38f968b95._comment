Generally if git-annex unused does not identify some object as unused, that
you expected would be unused, it's because it found a branch that still
uses that object. It might be some old branch (or tag) that you made and
forgot about, it might be a remote tracking branch, either for a remote
that you forgot to sync the changes to, or for an old remote that
got removed but in a way that left the tracking branch around.
annex.used-refspec can also pull in other, non-branch refs.
