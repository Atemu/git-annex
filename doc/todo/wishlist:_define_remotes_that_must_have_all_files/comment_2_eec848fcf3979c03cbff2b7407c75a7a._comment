Right, I have thought about untrusting all but a few remotes to achieve
something similar before and I'm sure it would kind of work. It would be more
of an ugly workaround, however, because I would have to untrust remotes that
are, in reality, at least semi-trusted. That's why an extra option/attribute
for that kind of purpose/remote would be nice.

Obviously I didn't see the scalability problem though. Good Point. Maybe I can
achieve the same thing by writing a log parsing script for myself?
