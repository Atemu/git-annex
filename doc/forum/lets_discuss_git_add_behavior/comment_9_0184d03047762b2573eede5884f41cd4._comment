I'm not sure which part of my post you are responding to..

Using `git add` with symlinks makes sense because you are adding the symlink, not the file, to git.

But we are talking about actual files (because unlocked or non-annexed), right? Where `git add` would add it to git instead of the annex.. which makes sense because the command for adding a *file* to git-annex is `git annex add`, not `git add`.
