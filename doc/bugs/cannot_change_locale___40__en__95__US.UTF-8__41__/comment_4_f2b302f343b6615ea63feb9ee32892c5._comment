This problem is still present in `6.20160412-gdcf8d3b`. Programs run inside `runshell` will complain that

    locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
    locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
    locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory

Is it possible to remove the `LOCPATH=/dev/null` workaround now that GHC 7.10 is used to build the standalone bundles?
