Unfortunately there is currently no git-annex rpm available for openSUSE;
however it is possible to build it via cabal or from source as described on
the [[install]] page.  Fulfilling the dependencies listed on that page
should not be a problem, except for obtaining a suitable version of the
Haskell library.

The last [official release of Haskell for openSUSE](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=devel:languages:haskell)
is quite old, and may not satisfy the dependencies needed by git-annex.
Fortunately [searching the openSUSE build service](http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=cabal&baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.4&lang=en&include_home=true&exclude_debug=true)
reveals that Peter Trommler has built a [newer Haskell suite](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Aptrommler%3Adevel%3Alanguages%3Ahaskell)
based on ghc 7.2. To install this, simply click on the relevant
"1-Click Install" link in the openSUSE build service search results.
