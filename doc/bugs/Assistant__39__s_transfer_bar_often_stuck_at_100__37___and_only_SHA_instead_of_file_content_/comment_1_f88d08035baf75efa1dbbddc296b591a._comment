I was able to reproduce the progress bar sticking at 100%. I made two local
repos in the assistant, each a remote of the other (not using ssh), and
added a file to one. It reached 100% fairly quickly, and then sat there
for a minute or so, before getting unstuck.

(The bug submitter's log includes "hPutStr: illegal operation (handle is
closed)" and I did not always see that in my test. May be unrelated.)

While stuck like that, I noticed that git-annex info also said the transfer
was still in progress. So apparently transferkeys is being delayed from
finishing the transfer for some reason.

Looking at ps, I noticed that "git-annex smudge --clean -- thefile" was a
child process of transferkeys. (The file was unlocked, and was the file I
had just added and that it was stuck on.) This may be a red herring; I
don't always see that when it's stuck.

On a hunch, I stopped the assistant process that was running in the sibling
repo of the one where I was adding files. So there was only a single
assistant running, not two. That seems to have gotten rid of the delay, or
at least most of it. It still takes around 6s longer than I would have
expected at the end.

Running transferkeys manually, and feeding it requests in its internal
protocol, transfers happened in well under a second. It did not do any
smudging then.

My guess so far is that something about the two assistants causes a race,
which it has to delay for a while to recover from.
