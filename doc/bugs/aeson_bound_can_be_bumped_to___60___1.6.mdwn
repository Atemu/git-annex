### Please describe the problem.

git-lfs has an aeson upper bound of < 1.5, but I have built it successfully with aeson 1.5.4

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-lfs 1.1.0 on nixos


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I really like git-annex. Although I have to admit I am not an active user myself. I just want to keep it working for all nixos users, I know some that rely on it.
