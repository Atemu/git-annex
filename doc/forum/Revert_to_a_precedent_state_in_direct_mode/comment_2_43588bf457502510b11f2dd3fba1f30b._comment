With the proxy command, would the following be an appropriate way to discard all changes (mods, adds, dels) since last sync in a direct mode repo?

    git annex proxy -- git clean -df
    git annex proxy -- git checkout -f .

Also, is it necessary to run annex sync or other direct mode housekeeping commands afterwards?
