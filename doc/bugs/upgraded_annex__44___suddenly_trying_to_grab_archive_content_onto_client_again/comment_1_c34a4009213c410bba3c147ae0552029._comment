Tried again with the usb drive plugged in; still kept trying to transfer archive content, which was present in 2 other places (that usb drive and the ssh remote), down from the ssh remote.

Tried disabling syncing from the ssh remote in the webapp; the assistant finished the last transfer from it and queued up a bunch of transfers from the USB remote instead.

Turned assistant off completely; tried a \"git annex drop --auto\".  (with the USB drive still plugged in.)  Nothing dropped.

Tried a \"git annex drop --in=here '*/archive/*'\" -- it dropped all the content from my archive directories.  whew!
