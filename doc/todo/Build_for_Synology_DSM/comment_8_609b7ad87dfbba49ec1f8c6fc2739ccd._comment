I have a Synology NAS too, so I thought I could try to run git-annex in a Debian chroot.
As it [turns out](http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.php/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have), my model (DS213+) runs on a PowerPC CPU instead of ARM. Unfortunately, it isn't compatible with PPC in Debian either because it is a different PowerPC variant.
There is an unofficial Debian port called [powerpcspe](http://wiki.debian.org/PowerPCSPEPort), but ghc doesn't build there yet for [some reason](http://buildd.debian-ports.org/status/package.php?p=git-annex&suite=sid).

Any chance that there will be a build for this architecture at some point in the future or should I better look for another NAS? ;-)
