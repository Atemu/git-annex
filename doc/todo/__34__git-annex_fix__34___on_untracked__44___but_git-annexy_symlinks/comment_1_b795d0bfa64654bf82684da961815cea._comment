Currently git-annex uses git-ls-files to find the files to act on.
This would requires running git-ls-files twice, once with --others to find
the files not checked into git.

I don't like the added complexity, the slowdown for everyone else,
etc. 

Also, I think it's very reasonable that git-annex commands do not
act on files that are not checked into git (except for git-annex add of
course). Acting on files that are not checked into git violates least
surprise.

So, just add the file to git if you want git-annex fix to
act on it. You don't even have to commit the file, you can just
stage it in the index, and then un-stage it after git-annex is done with
it, if for some reason you don't want to check it into git.
