I think that the "glacier" program you have installed is
the one from boto, not the one from glacier-cli. git-annex only supports
the glacier-cli one.

Note that, since version 5.20150219, git-annex probes to see if the
"glacier" program in PATH is the one from boto, and fails with a nicer
error message.
