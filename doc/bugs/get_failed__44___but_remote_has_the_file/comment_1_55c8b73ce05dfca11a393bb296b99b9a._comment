One completely legitimate way for this to happen would be if bucket is a removable drive or other filesystem, and it is not mounted (or its directory doesn't contain a git repo for whatever reason). It would look identical to what you showed happening.

Otherwise, what kind of remote is bucket? Special remote or git remote?
