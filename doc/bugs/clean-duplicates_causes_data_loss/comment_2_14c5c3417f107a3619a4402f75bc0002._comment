--clean-duplicates is not really intended to go do a full verification
that the annexed content is present. I can see how this is surprising;
it would probably be better if it were named "--clean-seen-content"
or something like that.

But, --deduplicate has the same behavior for such files, and I can't see a
way to rename that more effectively.

For now I have improved the git-annex-import man page to note that
annexed content that's been removed would make a file be considered a
duplicate.
