The sync man page does mention fetching and merging:

	The sync process involves first committing any local changes to files
	that have previously been added to the repository,
	then fetching and merging the current branch

Not that I really buy the argument that not mentioning use of some specific git
command means that it should bypass git configurations that apply to that
command. git commands often don't document other git commands that they use
as plumbing, for example.

The output with this configuration is essentially:

	pull repo-b
	fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
	failed

So the user is told right there that sync tried to pull.
And the pull failed. Why? Something to do with fast-forward. While this would
be clearer if git mentioned the config that is making it require a fast-forward,
it does not seem an indecipherable behavior.

And also, you have to have *globally* configured an option that prevents fast forwarding.
That is a major, massive change to git's behavior. git is going to be falling over on
pull all the time in many circumstances with the same error message.

Similarly, if you had configured merge.verifySignatures globally, git-annex
sync would be likely to fail. All your arguments would seem to require I also
override that option. But that could be a big security hole.
