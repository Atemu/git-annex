Hum, fair enough. The webapp might not be the best target. However, there might already be some logic to deploy the key, only not exposed in any UI (web or CLI).

However, I was under the impression that the key thath git-annex installs remotely is also limited to running git-annex-related tasks (using the command option; I cannot find any example in my configurations at the moment), rather than providing a generic login shell which happens to be used for git-annex.

The command to run on the remote server did not seem to be trivial (this is what I'm currently bumping against), and I guess there already are a few functions which create and install the authorized_files entry. Maybe providing, e.g., a

    git-annex installkey REMOTE

command, automating only this key-setup step for the user, would be good?
