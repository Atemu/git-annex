I agree that it is a tricky situation. The main issue I have is that archive preferred content expressions indicates that all versions are transferred, but when you (worst case) migrate full archives to other disks and just use git annex sync --content, you would loose all objects.

I like the idea of --content --all as this would be consistent with other commands such as fsck for example.
Still it seems with preferred content expressions only applying to working tree data that it would still miss \"copies=backup:2\" for example and only use working tree files. Which is misleading and could lead to dataloss in my opinion.

So the best would probably be to let preferred content for number of copies at least work on all objects, either per default or when \"git annex sync --content --all\" is used. You wouldn't run that on usual repos, but definitely on backup, archive or similar repos.
