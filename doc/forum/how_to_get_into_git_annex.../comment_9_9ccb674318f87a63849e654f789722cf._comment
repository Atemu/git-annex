I'll chew on the rest of your response, I was bent on hardlinks because I haven't messed with btrfs reflog COW thing much, but its likely clearly the way to go here, so all of my consternation with hardlinks is likely getting me nowhere. I am just always at 90% full and so I don't want to do anything that is going to run me out of space in the middle of an expensive operation. 

anyways, thanks. I guess I just wish I had only put big files into my annex at first, though I would never have known how badly it fails at scale (on my hardware, etc.)
