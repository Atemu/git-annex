### Please describe the problem.

I have to run the webapp to do upgrades...it would be nice to have a CLI.  I would hate for the CLI to be less featured than the webapp.  Unless I've missed it in the man page?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
