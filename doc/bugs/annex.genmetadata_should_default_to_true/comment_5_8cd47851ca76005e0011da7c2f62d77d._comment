I agree with Ilya's points.

And it's unresonable to characterize this as data loss, because git itself
does not store file timestamp data. Making such mischaracterizations does,
however, cause me, as the maintainer, to wonder if this is a feature that
is worth keeping, since I have no interest in descending that rabbit hole
or fighting such accusations. Generally, going to the strongest possible
argument, when requesting a change, is not actually your best move.

Closing this bug report.
