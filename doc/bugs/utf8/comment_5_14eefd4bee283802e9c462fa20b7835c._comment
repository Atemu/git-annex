Hi,

Sorry, it was on my phone and very long and I didn't think it'd be important... Sheesh Users eh!

I think the error happened for every file or at least lots, not just the one with the strange tilde above the \"n\".
Eventually, it might have been after a phone reboot, it sorted itself and continued.

I can try and recreate it if it'll help, though it won't be till Wednesday / Thursday as I'm going away for a few days and I still need to pack.

Sorry for the bad bug report, I know how annoying they are.

It's not so easy for me to upgrade because one's an Ubuntu LTS and one is a Mint Debian Edition, both are the repository versions.
