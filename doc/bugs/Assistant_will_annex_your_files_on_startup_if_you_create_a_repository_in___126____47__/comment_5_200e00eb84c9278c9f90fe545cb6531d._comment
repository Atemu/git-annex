If ~/ is a git repository, the assistant will still refuse to run in it,
unless you've manually run `git annex init` in that git repository
at some point in the past.

Here it is in my home directory, which is indeed a git repo:

	joey@darkstar:~>git annex assistant
	git-annex: First run: git-annex init

When I run the webapp, it doesn't run the assistant, but prompts in the web browser for
where I want to make a new git-annex repository.
