Wow, the `git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch 100mb-3' HEAD` that you'd expect to remove the file doesn't workâ€”`git annex sync` merges it right back in from one of its internal branches (filtering `synced/master` too seems to work).

I'd hate to think of the mess had I actually had remotes. Good thing this is a test repository!

(It *almost* happened on a real one, but I control-C'd it before it committed, after wondering 'why is it taking forever...')
