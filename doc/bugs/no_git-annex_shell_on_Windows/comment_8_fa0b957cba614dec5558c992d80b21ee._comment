For reference, here's the .git/config section.

I can either set receivepack/uploadpack like below or add /cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Git/libexec/git-core to PATH in cygwin shell.

Also, if I set url to /cygdrive/f/backup/f, git complains that it's not a git repository (msysgit doesn't understand cygwin stuff?)

    [remote \"kpf\"]
            url = kp:f:/backup/ph
            fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/kpf/*
            receivepack = git receive-pack
            uploadpack = git upload-pack
            annex-uuid = 99c498fc-e38e-11e3-8bb0-5368a291bd90
            annex-ignore = true
