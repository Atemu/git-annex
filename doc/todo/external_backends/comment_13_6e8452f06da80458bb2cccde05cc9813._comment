1. What is the advantage of a separate `VERIFYCONTENT` request, vs calling `GENKEY` and comparing the result?
2. Can the protocol specify that the file passed to `GENKEY` may be a named pipe?  Or, add a `CANPIPE` request where the external backend program tells git-annex that it can take pipes; if the program can't, git-annex can always drain the pipe to a tempfile before passing it to the program.
3. \"While stderr is connected to the console and so visible to the user, the program should avoid using it\" -- then maybe add `DEBUG` and `INFO` requests as in the [[design/external_special_remote_protocol]]?
