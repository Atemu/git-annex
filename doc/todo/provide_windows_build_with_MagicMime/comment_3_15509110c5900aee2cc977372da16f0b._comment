I looked into WSL 1 and 2 in the context (and with the hope) of trying to avoid having windows-specific code and documentation in and for datalad. My conclusion was that neither of them is practical (maybe: yet), because with a unix-like default setup of a repository (lock, symlinks) no repository content was accessible from outside the WSL environment. I think the main motivation for running on Windows is using Windows apps. And that specifically is not possible/easily achievable for any random app.
