If I've understood Efraim correctly, he means that soemone (perhaps, Joey) can run a custom F-Droid server with Joey's builds of the app, so that those using an F-Droid client would get the updates through this standard path (for them) instead of manually looking for updates here.

Like from a custom APT repository run not by Debian (in this case -- F-Droid team), but by an independent developer who is providing package builds not avaialble in Debian.
