This question happens to have overlap with the recent http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/help_running_git-annex_on_top_of_existing_repo/

I have a git repository which I want to keep in sync with an svn repository via git-svn. My git repository with annex stores large files (database dumps) in annex. I'm having trouble understanding how git-annex will hand off to git, and to git-svn. If I want to merge my repo to another git repo, or on to svn, do I have to do anything special to make sure my large files are not copied?

I tested this by cloning the git repo. The symlinks are copied, and become broken as they obviously point to the annex directory which is not copied by the clone.

The lesson seems to be: if you git clone or merge to a repo that is NOT annex enabled, you will end up with a normal git repo without any annex stuff. So as long as I don't explictly use git-annex, I can safely copy my other files to other repositories, and not worry about my annexed files coming along. Is this a safe conclusion for me to work with? Also, does anyone know of anything specific that would be different using git svn dcommit to merge my changes to an svn repo?

Thanks.
