Ok, this is a mix of luser error and a bug.

I noticed that I wasn't providing a description in git annex init. So if I do \"git annex init foo\" in the first repository and \"git annex init bar\" in the clone, then git annex status works!

So the bug is actually that you need to provide a description in git annex init, even though the man page says a description will be generated otherwise.

(In my defense I hit the non-ACII characters bug with the git annex version in Ubuntu, and that one still has the same error even if a description is provided so this was fixed later).
