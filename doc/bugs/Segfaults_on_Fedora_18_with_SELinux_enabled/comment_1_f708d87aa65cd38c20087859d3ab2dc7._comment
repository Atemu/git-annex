What is this GITWRAP? That is not part of git-annex, I suspect it's a locally set up wrapper around git of some sort.

--debug causes the assistant to log to `.git/annex/daemon.log`, there may be useful information in there. In particular it's not at all clear whether the web browser is segfaulting, or whether the crash occurs before the web browser is started.

Does your SE linux policy allow git-annex to run your web browser? What happens if you start the assistant and then manually open file:///home/zerodogg/Documents/annexed/.git/annex/webapp.html in your web browser?
