Approaching the solution after hours and hours of debugging:

https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7695
This explains why so much ram is used when trying to open gconv-modules in the ssh strace!

the local strace is using \"/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive\" instead of gconv-modules
both libs are stated in the ghc.haskell bug report

Just have to figure out, why the ghc created haskell binary tries to access gconv-modules instead of locale/locale-archive when run per ssh
