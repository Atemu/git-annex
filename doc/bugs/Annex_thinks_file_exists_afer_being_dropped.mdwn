#### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I've posted some code here:
   https://gist.github.com/4552036


#### What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I think I've found three bugs.  If they aren't bugs then there is a usage issue that could do with some documentation improvements.

Problem 1 - With 3 local annexes git-annex doesn't seem to search properly for them  (See code)

Problem 2 - Even after a sync an annex thinks another (local) annex has a file, even after it has been dropped  (See code)

SCARY bug - `whereis` seems to think that a locally dropped file still exists  (See code) 


#### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 3.20130114

OS: OSX 10.6.8
