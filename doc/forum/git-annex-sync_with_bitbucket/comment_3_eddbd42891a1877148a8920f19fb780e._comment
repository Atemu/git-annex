> But I do want git-annex-sync to sync the git-annex branch with that remote.

When annex-ignore is true, git-annex won't try to store content there, but `git annex sync` should still sync with the remote.  From the `man git-annex`

    This does not prevent git-annex sync (or the git-annex assistant) from
    syncing the git repository to the remote.

Setting `annex-sync=false` on the other hand will prevent `git annex sync` from syncing the remote unless it is explicitly named.

> Normally, git-annex deals with the case of git remotes that don't support git-annex-shell without giving an error.

AFAIK it deals with this by automatically setting annex-ignore on failure (fetching first to make sure it is not a connectivity issue).  I don't know why the error is getting through in this case.
