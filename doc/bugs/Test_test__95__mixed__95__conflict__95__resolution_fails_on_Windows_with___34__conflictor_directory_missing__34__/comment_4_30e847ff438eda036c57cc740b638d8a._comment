Ok, what's happening is that code path calls System.PosixCompat.Files.rename, and on unix that maps to regular rename() which can rename files or directories, but on windows, it's a compatability stub that calls haskell's renameFile, which oddly refuses to rename directories.

I remember testing my fix to the parent bug originally, but I don't know how. Possibly I changed something afterwards that exposed this new problem.

Need to use System.Win32.File.moveFile, which actually can move directories too. Made this change in git, and you can download an windows autobuild of it already if you'd like.
