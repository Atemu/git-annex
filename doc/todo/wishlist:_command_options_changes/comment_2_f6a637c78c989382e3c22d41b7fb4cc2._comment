Let's see..

* -v is already an alias for --verbose

* I don't find --source and --destination as easy to type or as clear as --from or --to.

* -F is fast, so it cannot be used for --force. And I have no desire to make it easy to mistype a short option and enable --force; it can lose data. 

@richard while it would be possible to support some syntax like \"git annex copy . remote\"; what is it supposed to do if there are local files named foo and bar, and a remotes named foo and bar? Does \"git annex copy foo bar\" copy file foo to remote bar, or file bar from remote foo? I chose to use --from/--to to specify remotes independant of files to avoid such
ambiguity, which plain old `cp` doesn't have since it's operating entirely on filesystem objects, not both filesystem objects and abstract remotes.

Seems like nothing to do here. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
