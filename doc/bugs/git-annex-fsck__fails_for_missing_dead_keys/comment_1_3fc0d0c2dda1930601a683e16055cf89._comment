Your transcript does not show the bug, but I was able to reproduce it eventually.

	# git annex required here anything
	# git annex add foo
	# git annex drop --force foo
	# git rm foo
	# git annex fsck --all
	fsck SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 
	  ** No known copies exist of SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
	
	  (Avoid this check by running: git annex dead --key )
	# git-annex dead --key SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
	# git annex fsck --all
	fsck SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 
	  This key is dead, skipping.
	ok
	# 

So far this is operating as expected. But then clone this repo to another
one, and in the other one:

	# git annex fsck --all --from origin
	fsck SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 
	  ** Required content SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 is missing from these repositories:
	  	56b59085-83b0-4b98-82c3-1baacd93d3e2 -- joey@darkstar:/tmp/test [origin]
	
	  This key is dead, skipping.
	failed
	(recording state in git...)
	git-annex: fsck: 1 failed

So fsck --from --all is verifying required content when it should not,
because a) matching required content with --all mostly doesn't make sense
(considering things like "include=" can be in it and can't be matched)
and b) it's not done without --all.

(I don't think dead keys are actually involved, I mean if a particular file
is set as required content of a repo, and is not present in it, fsck should
complain about that, even if the key is dead.)
