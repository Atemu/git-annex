IMHO, docker is too insecure to auto-install, enable and execute random special-remote programs. It has a extremely large attack surface (syscalls, ioctls, etc.) compared to, say, virtual machines. [And people regularly are able to break out of the latter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine_escape).
