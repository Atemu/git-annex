I think this issue of multiple files in a torrent is another place that
using an external special remote  (or maybe one built into git-annex)
is better than just specifying a download command. A special remote for
torrents could use a temp directory that accumulates all the files in the
torrent, and then pluck out specific files as git-annex requests them.

When git-annex exits, the special remote could clean up any unused files.
