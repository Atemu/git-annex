Similar to the yearly git user survey, there is a
[2018 git-annex user survey](http://git-annex-survey.branchable.com/polls/2018/).

If you use git-annex, please take a few minutes to answer the questions!

Since git-annex is seeing increasing use to manage scientific data, the
survey also includes some extra questions about that at the end.
