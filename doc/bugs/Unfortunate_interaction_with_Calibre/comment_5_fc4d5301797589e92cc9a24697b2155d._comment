calibre store all the metadata for safekeeping of the metadata
(author, title...).

If like me you do not like much direct mode (because of its not so
cool interaction with plain git), you could use the largfiles config
to let those files in plain git. You will then also need something for
the database. See [[tips/Git_annex_and_Calibre]] for a full solution.
