I mean, I made it do so already, but since this is not a bug tracking
system, but an increasingly too long set of disjoint comments, I didn't
want to follow up here to say that.

Please, if you have some question about special remotes, post it in the
forum. If you have an improvement, post a todo item. If you have a problem,
file a bug report. If you're commenting on this page, please think about
all the subsequent visitors who will see a huge comment thread and how they
will react.
