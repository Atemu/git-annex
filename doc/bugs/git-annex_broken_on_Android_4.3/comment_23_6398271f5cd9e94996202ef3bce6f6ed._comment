Script variation is ok.

So, it's looking like perhaps a problem with the way cabal links the executable, which I notice is a two stage process, vs the way ghc links it with --make.

To narrow down, here is hello built using cabal:

<http://tmp.kitenet.net/hello-cabal>

Here is git-annex built not using cabal:

<http://tmp.kitenet.net/git-annex-byhand>

(For my own reference, it's also built without WITH_CLIBS.)
