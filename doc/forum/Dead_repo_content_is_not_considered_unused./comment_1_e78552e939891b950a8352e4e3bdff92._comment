A file is not considered unused until there are no git branches that still
refer to that file. 

When you delete the symlink in step 5, you don't say
you commit it, so the master branch still refers to the file; it's not
unused.

Also, you have A as a remote of B still. So git still has a tracking
branch, remotes/A/master, that still contains the file. So the file
is still considered in use because of that.

I think you'll probably also have a synced/master branch that contains
the file too, at least until you sync with some other repository, or delete
the branch. Arguably that's an implementation detail of git-annex and perhaps
it should not consider those branches when checking for branches
that contain a file.
