[The first SHA1 collision](https://shattered.io/) was announced today,
produced by an identical-prefix collision attack.

After looking into it all day, it does not appear to impact git's security
immediately. But we're well past the time when it seemed ok that git
uses SHA1. If this gets improved into a chosen-prefix collision
attack, git will start to be rather insecure.

git-annex's SHA1 backend is already documented as only being 
"for those who want a checksum but are not concerned about
security", so no changes needed here.
