Finally got around to [report the issue to GHC tracker](http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5085#comment:7).

Looks quite alike (at least to the haskell-illiterate person like me) to a highest-priority issue that's hanging right at the top of the list.
There are other similar reports, but they seem to be either related to PowerPC Macs, closed as invalid or due to needinfo inactivity.

Guess any further discussion belongs there, unless ghc developers will bounce it back.
Thanks a lot for your help, Joey, and for sharing a great thing that git-annex is.
