Looks like the fix is to edit ~/.ssh/config and in each stanza added by git-annex, add this line:

        IdentitiesOnly yes

This prevents the ssh-agent from using the normal key, and allows the git-annex key to be used instead.

People experiencing this bug can manually make that change. Then if you edit your git-annex repository's `.git/config` and delete the `annex-ignore` line, the assistant should finally learn the UUID and start syncing.
