Hello, it has been a while since I posted here about this issue with sqlite but it keeps following me! I randomly get errors while trying to lock files: 
```sqlite worker thread crashed: SQLite3 returned ErrorIO while attempting to perform prepare \"SELECT null from content limit 1\": disk I/O error```

Should I worry about the state of my hard drive? And I don't know if it is intended, but when this happens, the process doesn't stop with a failure code, it just freezes.
I checked with top, and git-annex seems to continue doing stuff as it is still using a full core.
