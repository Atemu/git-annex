I'm running three repositories (laptop, usb connected to laptop, local server) that are connected via ssh access.
Running the webapp on both laptop and server, I'm quite frequently seeing in both webapps:

     warning
    Pusher crashed: fd:56: hPutStr: illegal operation (handle is closed)

Pushing the "Restart thread" button sometimes dismisses the warning, sometimes it immediatly comes back even when trying several times.
A similar warning sometimes shows up for a Netwatcher thread.

Not sure but when that crash occurs tranfers between the repos seem to get stalled.

Server: git-annex 7.20190129-2~bpo9+1 on debian stretch
Laptop: git-annex 7.20190129-3 on debian testing
