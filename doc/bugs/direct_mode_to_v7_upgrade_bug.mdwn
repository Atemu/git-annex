Upgrade from a direct mode repo to a v7 repo can cause annexed files to
get checked into git, in an edge case.

The annexed files need to be already v7 unlocked files, and their content
needs to be present in the direct mode repo. Of course this is an unusual
situation.

Then, the upgrade to v7 from direct mode makes a commit 
"commit before upgrade to annex.version 6" which converts the pointer
files into the full file content.
