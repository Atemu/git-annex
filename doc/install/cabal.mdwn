As a haskell package, git-annex can be installed using cabal.

Start by installing the [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/),
and then:

	cabal update
	PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
	cabal install git-annex -f-assistant --bindir=$HOME/bin

The above downloads the latest release and installs it into a ~/bin/
directory, which you can put in your PATH.

## building in the assistant and webapp

The above builds git-annex without the git-annex assistant and webapp. To
build with those features enabled, you will need to install several C
libraries and their headers, including libgnutls, libgsasl, libxml2, and
zlib. Then run:

	cabal install c2hs --bindir=$HOME/bin
	cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin

## building from git checkout

But maybe you want something newer (or older). Then [[download]] the version
you want, and use cabal as follows inside its source tree:

	cabal update
	PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
	cabal install c2hs --bindir=$HOME/bin
	cabal install --only-dependencies
	cabal configure
	cabal build
	cabal install --bindir=$HOME/bin
