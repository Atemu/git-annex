Currently there is no way to drop files, or list what files are available, on a special remote.
It would be good if "git annex drop" and "git annex find" supported the --from argument.

For commands that don't support the --from argument, it would also be nice to print an error.
Currently running "git annex drop --from usbdrive" doesn't behave as hoped and instead drops
all content from the local annex.
