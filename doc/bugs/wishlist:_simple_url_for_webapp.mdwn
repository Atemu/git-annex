### Please describe the problem.

The environment is os/x with chrome as the browser.

Let's say I close the tab with the webapp running in it. The 'git-annex webapp' process is still running, according to 'ps'.

So I open a new tab, but then what do I  type into the browser url bar to get the app back? What is usually there is a loopback address and an authorisation hash.

* Should I double-click on the git-annex icon in the dock (or Applications directory)?
* I figured out from observing the startup that if I give the url ://localhost/Users/me/annex/.git/annex/webapp.html I will get redirected to the right place.
Should I set up a bookmark for that?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

see above.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version: 4.20130723-ge023649 
Build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV FsEvents XMPP DNS
os: os/x 10.8.4

### Please provide any additional information below.

I notice that in the webapp ui, all the items at the top of the page highlight when one hovers over them and have useful URLs attached,
with the exception of the 'git-annex' item at the far left.What if that had the entry point url attached to it (so one could bookmark that)?
