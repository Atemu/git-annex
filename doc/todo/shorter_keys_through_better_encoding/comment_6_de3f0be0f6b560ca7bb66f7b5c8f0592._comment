Removing KEY/directory could give more savings, but sometimes there is more than one file there (eg key metadata), so the dir makes sense.  But the content filename in the dir neednâ€™t repeat the key.   But, changing that could be hard.  Adding backend variamts with base64-encoded checksums seems possible though?
