> Several commenters seem to be under the misapprehension that git add of a modified file that is stored in git before will annex the new version. It does not.

For what it's worth, this wasn't a misapprehension that I had in my posts above. It's possible I conflated or wasn't clear enough about other concerns in a way that created that impression (or maybe you simply weren't talking about my posts!), but my concerns are about:

  - Loss of control of what's added to git vs. git-annex
  - Violating the Principle of Least Astonishment
  - Too much \"magic\" requiring me to work against, instead of with, my tools
  - Breaking my and others' existing git-annex workflows

All of which are relevant to adding new files to the repo.
