# NAME

git-annex p2p - configure peer-2-peer links between repositories

# SYNOPSIS

git annex p2p [options]

# DESCRIPTION

This command can be used to link git-annex repositories over peer-2-peer
networks.

Currently, the only P2P network supported by git-annex is Tor hidden
services.

# OPTIONS

* `--gen-address`

  Generates addresses that can be used to access this git-annex repository
  over the available P2P networks. The address or addresses is output to
  stdout.

* `--link`

  Sets up a link with a peer over the P2P network.
  
  This will prompt for an address to be entered; you should paste in the
  address that was generated by --gen-address in the remote repository.

  A git remote will be created, with a name like "peer1", "peer2"
  by default (the `--name` option can be used to specify the name).

  The link is bi-directional, so the peer will also have a git
  remote added to it, linking back to the repository where this is run.

* `--name`

  Specify a name to use when setting up a git remote.

* `--one-way`

  Use with `--link` to create a one-way link with a peer, rather than the
  default bi-directional link.
