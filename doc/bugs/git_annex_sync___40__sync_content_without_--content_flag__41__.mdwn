### Please describe the problem.

Not sure if it's a bug, but pls explain why it sync files and how to stop it by cfg.

Repos. created with Assistant - git annex sync i an indirect mode not only fetch metadata but also a files. What is the correct way to disable file sync (so only broken links are created in working tree)

Desired:
to boostrap annex infrastructure with assistant, but then some repos switch to indirect mode (while still synced by assistant/webapp) but only metadata (not files). Files to be fetched on request (like git annex get xyz/*) when needed.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. with git annex webapp create two repos on two nodes (Alice and Bob).
2. pair them using discovery on local lan
3. on Bob stop assistant and fire "git annex indirect"
4. add files to Alice repo
5. run git annex sync on Bob repo from CLI

Bob's repo not only sync metadata but also retrive files.
The documentation says "sync" only sync metadata.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
