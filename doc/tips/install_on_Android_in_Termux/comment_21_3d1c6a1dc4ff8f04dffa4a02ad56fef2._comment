Well, I see the signal 11 too, on my arm64 phone running LineageOS Android 8.1. 
Some others had earlier reported it worked on arm64, but perhaps newer
versions of Android don't or whatever.

I made a test arm64 build, and it does work. Get it here:
<https://tmp.joeyh.name/git-annex-arm64-test-build/>

(I also had to run termux-fix-shebang as described above.) 

I do not yet have an arm64 autobuilder running, todo for that is
[[todo/arm64_autobuilder]] -- if anyone has an arm64 machine that could run
the autobuilder, that would help!
