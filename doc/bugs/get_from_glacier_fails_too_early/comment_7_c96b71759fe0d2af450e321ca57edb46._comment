I forgot to include the creds in `git annex info` for glacier; fixed that now.

It seems that changing the creds with `enableremote` did embed them into your git repository, but it neglected to update the .git/annex/creds/$remoteuuid file that caches the creds locally. So I think that your old creds are still cached there, and still being used, and this explains why the file is not found in glacier; the wrong creds are being used to access it! You can work around this by deleting the .git/annex/creds/$remoteuuid file correspnding to the uuid of the glacier remote. (You can also look at that file and compare it with what the creds are supposed to be.) I have fixed git-annex enableremote to update that creds file.

Also, it looks like you did not fall afoul of the [[upgrades/insecure_embedded_creds]] problem! If you had, this new version of git-annex would be complaining that it had detected that problem. If you want to double-check that, the s3creds= value is base64 encoded, and when run through `base64 -d`, it should yield a gpg encrypted file. If your repo did have that problem, it would instead decode to the creds in clear text.
