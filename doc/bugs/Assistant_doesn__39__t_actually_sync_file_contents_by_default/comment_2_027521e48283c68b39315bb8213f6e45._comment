I know what the broken symlinks are I just don't think they should ever happen in a direct mode repository. They're an artifact of the traditional way git-annex was run but the assistant in direct mode should never use them. Right now if one of the repositories changes a file and another finds out that has happened but hasn't synced the content yet you lose access to your file. That's not acceptable in a file sync utility. Dropbox certainly doesn't do that. What git-annex should do in this case is use the knowledge of the updated file to run a sync but before it can complete it maintain the file at its previous version. By definition direct mode should not be deleting my files and replacing them with symlinks, it should only replace existing files with newer versions of those same files.

I also don't know why numcopies didn't work but it shouldn't be needed at all. What I want to do is to tell the assistant \"sync the contents of every file into this repository as soon as you can from whatever remote you happen to be able to copy it from\". I couldn't find a setting that would do that though.
