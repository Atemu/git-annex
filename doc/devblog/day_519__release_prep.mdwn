I'm in release prep mode now, fixing build problems and a few bugs, but
the v6 sprint is well over, though v6 still has its issues.
Might as well release all the last month's work.

Yesterday was taken up with dealing with some very ugly git interface
stuff that changed between versions. An July workaround for a bug in
git turns out to have caused reversions with older versions, and was not
a complete fix either. Tuned it to hopefully work better.
