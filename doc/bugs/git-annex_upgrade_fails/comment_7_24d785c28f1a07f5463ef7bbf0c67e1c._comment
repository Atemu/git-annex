You are responding to a bug that was fixed and closed 6 months ago 
with some complaint about a vague error message.

While it's true that the error message reported in the original bug report
was not very good -- because git was crashing! -- the fix involved making
git-annex detect the problimatic git versions and display a useful message.
See [[!commit 1558e03014f6a5ebf71e04f1498dd3c1acdbad5c]]

If you are having a problem with current versions of git-annex, you need to
file a new bug report, not followup vaguely to an old one. Thank you.
