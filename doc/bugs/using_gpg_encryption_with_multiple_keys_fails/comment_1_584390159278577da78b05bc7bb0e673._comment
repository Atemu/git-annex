AFAICs, this is a known bug in git-remote-gcrypt: <https://github.com/blake2-ppc/git-remote-gcrypt/issues/9> 

In your log, it encrypts to A1FE7E9BECB5C7CA. I think this is the new key that git-annex generated. The problem comes when trying to decrypt the manifest, then it tries every gpg key until it finds one that works.
