“The tricky part is that multiple git-annex assistant processes can be running, if there are multiple local repositories.”

This would probably mean a lot of work, but it might be nice if there was just a single git-annex assistant per user which could take care of multiple local repos. The UI would be nicer, too, since the status of and notifications from every repository could be shown in the same place.
