You have described the following git-annex network:

	A --(ssh)-- S --(ssh)-- B

So A automatically syncs to S. But there is no way at all for A to tell B that it has made changes. So B does not automatically sync.

The git-annex webapp will detect this kind of situation, and display this alert:

[[assistant/xmppnudge.png]]

Once you set up an XMPP account, the network will look like: 

	A --(ssh)-- S --(ssh)-- B
	\_________(XMPP)_______/
                    
And now B will immediatly know when A has pushed a change to S, and will go get it.                                          

(The `getDirectoryContents` error is probably because you are running git annex sync in a repository that the git-annex assistant is running in, and they are both using the same tmp directory for merging branches sync pulled. It does not seem to be worth worrying about.)
