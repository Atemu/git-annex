Hi. I read the post http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files/, and got into this post through the comment to check the limitations of repo v6.
I read through this post, but I still don't grasp the drawbacks of repo v6.
I like the idea of mixed mode repositories with locked and unlocked co-existing. And I need repo v6 for that right?
I also like the annex.largefiles to control what is annex what is normal git files.
With these two combined feature I can configure my project and let users without too much burden on controlling what is annex, what is not, and what are locked or unlocked.
I want to use repo v6, but what are the drawbacks on adopting it? Is it in terms of git could be bugged? Or the smudge filters could be bugged?
Sorry for not being able to grasp this from the current post. I appreciate any help. Thanks.
