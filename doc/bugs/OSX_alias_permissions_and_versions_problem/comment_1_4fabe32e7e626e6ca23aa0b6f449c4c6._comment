After looking more into the git annex working, I understand the use of symlinks, but they are not always correctly handled by OSX. 


Apple's Timemachine uses hardlinks for example... 


Not being able to easily edit files that are in the repo without problems or quirks makes it unusable as a dropbox replacement and version control, which is a shame.
