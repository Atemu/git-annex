Seems sharebox development stopped a year ago...now that you are working on the assistant, which sound awesome, I think you really should consider pick up the sharebox development and integrate it.

Too bad I missed kickstarter, but I might donate now. 
I just find it wierd that it said \"Like Dropbox\" on the title, but sharebox-like functionality is not on the roadmap, and being able to easily edit the files is a big feature of dropbox.
