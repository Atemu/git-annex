It's now possible to use storageclass=NEARLINE, when git-annex is built
with aws-0.13.0. So, the approach of manually creating the bucket with the
desired storage class should work now.

I'm unsure if the first method, of letting git-annex create the bucket,
will work now. Can you test? It may work now too with
storageclass=NEARLINE. While no storage class is currently specified when
creating the bucket (that's not in the S3 api at all); but once the bucket
exists, with whatever storage class is default, git-annex will specify
NEARLINE when storing objects in it. Seems a good chance this will work,
and it'd be easier than extending the aws library with google-specific
features.
