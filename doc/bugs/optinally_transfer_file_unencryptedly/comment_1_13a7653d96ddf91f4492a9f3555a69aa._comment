Using a plain tcp connection would be simpler than HTTP, the sending side would just need to tell the receiver to listen on a port and write any data received to a file(or the reverse). Basically what you can do with netcat.

I had a similar problem, but I found that using arcfour was fast enough:

.ssh/config:

    Host slow
    Ciphers arcfour
