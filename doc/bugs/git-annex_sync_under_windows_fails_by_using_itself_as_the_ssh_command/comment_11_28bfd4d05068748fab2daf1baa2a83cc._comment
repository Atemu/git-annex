I took another look at this, and I have a suspicion that the difference is
window's behavior when an env var is set to the empty string.

On Unix, that has a distinct meaning from an env var being set. I suspect
that it doesn't on Windows. Or perhaps on some versions of windows and/or
some versions of haskell libraries on some versions of windows... (Since I
still can't reproduce the problem on windows myself.)

If `GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION=""` results in it not being set, then the rest
of this bug report follows.

I've made a simple change. If the option is empty, it doesn't try to set
`GIT_SSH` at all. I am pretty sure this entirely fixes the problem.

Please test the windows daily build, which has this fix applied to it,
and get back to me if not.
