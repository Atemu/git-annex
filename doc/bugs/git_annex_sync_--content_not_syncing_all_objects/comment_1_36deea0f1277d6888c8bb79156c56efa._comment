Yep, sync --content only looks at the work tree. 

I suppose that the assistant does a better job in this situation, since if it cannot access an archive repo, it will remember that it tried to send a file to it, and retry that transfer later -- even if in the meantime the file has gotten deleted out of the work tree (and still has content present, due to using indirect mode). I'm actually not 100% sure .. the assistant may give up on transferring a file if it's gotten removed from the work tree. It's worth considering this because I basically want sync --content to do the same syncing that the assistant does.

Anyway, sync --content could certianly look at all keys present in the annex. This would require a separate pass, and it might then try to upload a key twice, once from work tree, and once from annex, and fail twice. 

Maybe it would be better to have this as a separate --content --all. It might also make sense to keep sync --content only looking at the work tree by default to support cases where there are multiple branches and you only want to sync one.

I think this needs more thought.
