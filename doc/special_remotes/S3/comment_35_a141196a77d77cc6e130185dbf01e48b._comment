> I don't want to enable versioning since that permanently loses the chance of dropping any objects (even if they're stored elsewhere)

I believe it is in principle [possible to remove object versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/delete-object.html) from S3 and/or completely wipe out an object with all of its versions (so it wouldn't be just a DeleteMarker added as the most recent version).  So in principle git-annex could (if doesn't already, didn't check) delete previous versions in a versioned bucket upon `drop`.
