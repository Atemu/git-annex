 - What if the key there already has content? This could happen for

 - Perhaps there has been a hash collision generating the keys.
 -
 - The current strategy is to assume that in this case it's safe to delete
 - one of the two copies of the content; and the one already in the annex
 - is left there, assuming it's the original, canonical copy.
 -
 - I considered being more paranoid, and checking that both files had
 - the same content. Decided against it because A) users explicitly choose
 - a backend based on its hashing properties and so if they're dealing
 - with colliding files it's their own fault and B) adding such a check
 - would not catch all cases of colliding keys. For example, perhaps 
 - a remote has a key; if it's then added again with different content then
 - the overall system now has two different peices of content for that
 - key, and one of them will probably get deleted later. So, adding the
