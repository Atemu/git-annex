It sound to me it would be 1st prize if the cloud provider supported the git-annex functionality over ssh.
Then it could be a full git-annex repo, and used for recovery if my laptop with the git info gets lost.

From [[special remotes]] \"These can be used just like any normal remote by git-annex\"
Your comment \"No, special remotes do not contain a copy of the git repository\"

so a special remote is 
A. just a remote filesystem, that contains the objects with sha1 names ?
B. there is no git info and thus no file name & directory details or am i missing something ?
C. you can't use the remote as a cloud drive to sync changes e.g. file moves, renames between two other git-annex repositories ? (no meta data)
D. the data on the cloud/rsync storage can not be used directly it has to moved into a git-annex capable storage location.

Would it not be better to mount the remote storage over ssh(sshfs) and then use full git-annex on mounted directory ?
