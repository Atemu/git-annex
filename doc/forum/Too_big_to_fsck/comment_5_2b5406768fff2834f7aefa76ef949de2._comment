You have an older version of git, which does not support --no-dangling.

git-annex will detect that, and omit the option. This does make it more likely that git fsck is outputing a ton of information, so I continue to think that's the most likely cause of the memory use.

Please verify with: git fsck --no-reflogs |wc
