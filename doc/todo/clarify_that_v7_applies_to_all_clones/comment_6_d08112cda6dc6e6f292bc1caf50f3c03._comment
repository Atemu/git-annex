THANK YOU Kyle!  `find --unlocked` works!
  
But the tricky part is that I wanted to use some \"single\" instance of git-annex which would support `find --unlocked` and also v5 so I could fsck and do some other tests after I do the evil downgrade.  But older versions, such as 7.20191114, which support v5 do not support v8, so cannot do `find --unlocked` on v8.  So I need to either

- find another later version which would support both v5 and v8
- make script use multiple versions of git-annex from different locations (one for initial `find --unlocked` and then another one for subsequent checks etc)
- find a way for `find --unlocked`  without invoking `git-annex`.
