Hashing & segmenting seems to be around the corner, which is nice :)

Is there a chance that you will optionally add mtime to your native metadata store? If yes, I'd rather wait for v2 to start with the native system from the start. If not, I will probably set it up tonight.

PS: While posting from work, my comments are held for moderation once again. I am somewhat confused as to why this happens when I can just submit directly from home. And yes, I am using the same auth provider and user in both cases.
