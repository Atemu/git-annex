Regarding git-annex-dead:

Dead-ifying keys automatically could result in the situation where a key is marked as dead and the user doesn't (and wouldn't) know about it (until trying to use the file) because git-annex would never complain about it.

Adding --batch support for `git-annex-dead --keys` would be good. I suggest making a todo for just that and/or for adding support for `git annex drop --force --dead`?
