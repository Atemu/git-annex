you'll notice that some of those processes have been hanging out there for days. i believe the TCP sockets are long gone, at least their parent SSH process are gone. this is why i related this to the \"kill git-annex assistant on logout\" - but since git-annex doesn't do setsid anymore (right?) I don't understand why those process could be left there without a parent... especially since that's on the server-side, which has a (relatively) up to date git-annex version...
