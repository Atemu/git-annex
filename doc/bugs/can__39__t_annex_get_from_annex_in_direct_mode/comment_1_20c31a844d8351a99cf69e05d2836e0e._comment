When I tried to duplicate these results today, it failed in a different fashion.

adding a new file (file2.txt) to a test repo on windows, setting up an HTTP access, and fetching and merging onto linux leaves the following state:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
test-git-annex@linux_host:~/test_annex$ ls -l
total 4
lrwxrwxrwx 1 test-git-annex test-git-annex   <datetime> file1.txt -> this is some content?
lrwxrwxrwx 1 test-git-annex test-git-annex   <datetime> file2.txt -> some new content, on a new annex
\"\"\"]]

it is treating the contents of the files as the name of a symlink. get annex get . is unable to retrieve them as contents.
