My general feeling about git-annex import is that everything not involving
importing from a special remote should be deprecated and eventually
removed.

The --duplicate option probably does what you want, but if the interface is
going to be changed, such as making that the default, I'd rather the
interface change move toward the goal of deprecating the old mode.

The fundamental mistake that the legacy interface made is it conflated
copying content into the repository, dropping content from the directory, 
and updating the working tree. The new interface decouples all 3,
only doing the first, and updating a tracking branch, which the user is then
free to merge as-is, or otherwise modify before merging. Dropping requires
an export of a new tree, which is the main pain point in emulating
the old interface, but you happen to not want to drop the content from the
directory, so that pain point shouldn't affect you.
