Seeing `git-annex sync` after resolving a merge conflict between a
directory and an annexed file leave behind
files like `foo~refs_remotes_origin_master`, which are not checked into
git. 

Also happens with merge.directoryRenames=conflict

Seems to only happen sometimes, unsure why.. Maybe git doesn't always
write those files, or sometimes something done with git deletes them?

Root cause seems to be that it's making an InodeCache, but that can't
be done of a broken symlink. So, it's probably a reversion introduced with
v7 unlocked files or so.
