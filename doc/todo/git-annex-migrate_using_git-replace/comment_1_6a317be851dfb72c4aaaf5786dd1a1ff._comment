Very interesting idea! But some problems:

- As mentioned, not only `.git/annex/<...>` blobs need to be replaces for every key, but also `/annex/<...>`
and all `../.git/annex/<...>`, `../../.git/annex/<...>`, etc.

- In big repositories it can create a giant amount of *refs/replace/* refs.
I don't know how it affects the performance if they are stored in .git/packed-refs,
but it can interfere with the normal operation on a repo.
For example `git show-ref` will not work without ` | grep` or something.
