haskell http-client has a strange default handling of compressed files.
It seems to want to decompress them unless the content-type is
"application/x-tar". It defaults to accept-encoding of gzip.

That seems to be targeting being used to implement a web browser or
something, although I don't entirely understand how that behavior would
make sense for a web browser either; I'd expect it to only decompress
content that was transparently compressed in transit, but not other
content. Firefox does not decompress that tarball when downloading it; nor
does it display a foo.html.gz as a web page; it downloads it as-is. 

Very strange default for a general purpose http library; IMHO it's a bug.

`Accept-Encoding: identity` and no transparent decompression seems to be
the way to go here, just like wget.
