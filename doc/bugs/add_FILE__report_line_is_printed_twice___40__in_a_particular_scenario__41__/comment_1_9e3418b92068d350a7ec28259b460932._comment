This is because git-annex add makes multiple passes looking for files in
different situations. In particular, the withFilesMaybeModified and
withFilesOldUnlocked passes both find the file.

I don't immediately see a way to improve it. But it is avoided in v6 mode.

(I'm fairly sure someone, possibly even you, has reported this same issue
before, so it's probably still open somewhere.)
