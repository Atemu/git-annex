hS3's author seems to have abandoned it and it has other problems. I should try to switch to a different S3 library.

There is now a workaround; S3 special remotes can be configured to use [[chunking]]. A max of one chunk will then be buffered in memory at a time. 

For example, to reconfigure an existing mys3 remote: `enableremote mys3 chunk=1MiB`
