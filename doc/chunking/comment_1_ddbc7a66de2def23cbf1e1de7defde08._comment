\"git-annex has to buffer chunks in memory before they are sent to a remote\" -- would it be hard to remove this restriction?  I want to have a non-chunked S3 remote, so that files in it can be accessed through a URL.  But if some files are 50GB, then git-annex running on a 16GB machine would fail when talking to this repo?
