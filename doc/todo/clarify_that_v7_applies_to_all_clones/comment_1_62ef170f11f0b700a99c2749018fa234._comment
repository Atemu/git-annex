You only need to upgrade to v7 when the repository has unlocked files
committed to it. If a file contains a pointer to an annex object, it won't
work with v5. There is not a good way for git-annex to detect when that is
the case; such a file could be committed any time. Committing unlocked
files and upgrading has to be coordinated amoung the users of the repository.
