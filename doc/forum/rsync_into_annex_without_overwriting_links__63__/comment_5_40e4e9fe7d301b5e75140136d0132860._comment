Just to clarify: My comment was in the context of unlocked files (in
v6+ repos).  In that case, symlinks aren't used: the content is kept
in the working tree (and a pointer file is tracked by git).

Also, since it sounds like you may want all files to be unlocked, you
might want to look into `git annex adjust --unlock` to enter an
adjusted with all files in an unlocked state.

FWIW, if you don't need importing for this use case, I think using
`git annex export` with an rsync special remote configured with
`exporttree=yes` would work well.
