git-annex 7.20190730 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Improved probing when CoW copies can be made between files on the same
     drive. Now supports CoW between BTRFS subvolumes. And, falls back to rsync
     instead of using cp when CoW won't work, eg copies between repos on the
     same EXT4 filesystem.
   * Add BLAKE2BP512 and BLAKE2BP512E backends, using a blake2 variant
     optimised for 4-way CPUs.
   * Support running v7 upgrade in a repo where there is no branch checked
     out, but HEAD is set directly to some other ref.
   * Windows build no longer ships with a copy of rsync, since that is only
     used any more to access rsync special remotes or remotes with a very
     old version of git-annex-shell.
   * Windows build is now 64 bit, and using it with the 64 bit git for
     Windows is fully supported.
   * Windows problems with long filenames should be fixed now,
     since the Windows build is made with a newer ghc version that works
     around the problems.
   * stack.yaml: Build with http-client-0.5.14 to get a bug fix to http header
     parsing.
   * Drop support for building with ghc older than 8.4.4,
     and with older versions of serveral haskell libraries.
   * Support building with socks-0.6 and persistant-template-2.7.
   * Corrected some license statements.
     Thanks, Sean Whitton."""]]
