Hello everyone,
Creating a new repository through the web-app fails on Android 4.4.3 (current git annex version downloaded from http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/android/current/4.3/git-annex.apk ).

Steps to reproduce the problem:
(1) install git annex from the aforementioned apk
(2) launch git annex.
(3) the terminal opens up reporting some (non-fatal?) errors. (I notice that I can't do anything in the terminal, is it supposed to reply to git annex commands? typing in "git annex version" does nothing.)
(4) The web-app is launched
(5) Click on make repository
(6) Error message

I've made a few screenshots to illustrate:

This is the terminal:

This is the webapp error when creating a new repo:
(1) to be continued in 2.

(2) ... continued from 1.

Being on android I can't find any ".git/annex/daemon.log to" to report. I tried to look in the repo folder but there was no .git in it (maybe hidden?)
