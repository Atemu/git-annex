I think that making rmurl filter out urls with an OtherDownloader
when removing an url claimed by the web is sufficient.
Then SETURIPRESENT won't confuse rmurl from the web.

But what about SETURLPRESENT? Well, that url ought to be a url that can be
downloaded by the web special remote. And if the web special remote is marked
as present, it will try to download from that url along with whatever other urls
are recorded. So, it makes sense for rmurl to treat that url as an indication
that the web still has content, when removing some other url.

But then if an url is added to the web, and then an external special remote
uses SETURLPRESENT with another url, and then rmurl removes the first url,
and then SETURLMISSING removes the other url, the content will still be marked
as present in the web. So it seem that SETURLMISSING should mark the
content as not present in the web if that was the last url. (So should other
special remotes that remove regular urls, like bittorrent.)

Currently the content is marked as not present in the remote making the change,
which is the wrong thing! (And SETURLPRESENT/SETURIPRESENT mark content
as present in the external remote, which also seems unncessary.)

The remaining case is an rmurl on an url with an OtherDownloader,
which is being removed from some other special remote than web, when there are
some more urls with OtherDownloader that were set by other special remotes.

I think that it doesn't actually make sense for rmurl of such an url to 
mark the content as not being present in the special remote. The user should
drop it if they want to remove it from the special remote. It's ok for it to
remove the url but not update the presence information.
