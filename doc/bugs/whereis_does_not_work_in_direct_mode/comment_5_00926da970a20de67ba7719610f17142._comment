I have found out that there is a connection between this problem and the _global_ configuration of `annex.alwayscommit`. This problem will appear only if `annex.alwayscommit` is globally set to `false`. What is very strange is that setting `annex.alwayscommit` locally does not make this bug appear; only a globally set `annex.alwayscommit` will trigger this problem.

I fixed the test script to set `annex.alwayscommit` globally.

Now I see why I could reproduce this bug on different machines but Joey could not: all my machines have the same `~/.gitconfig`.
