fastDebug is implemented.. Benchmarking, I get:

- without debugging in Annex.Branch: 4.75s
- debug in Annex.Branch: 4.88s, 0.027% slower
- fastDebug in Annex.Branch: 4.83s, 0.016% slower

So I was right that fastDebug would be faster, but I guess there's still
some small overhead to check the data structure to see if debugging is
enabled, and it may not be possible to avoid that. (Maybe unboxing would
help?)

I'm not bothered by such a small slowdown;
git-annex has been sped up a lot in recent times and it's ok to pay that.
(Although I actually finessed it by not debugging cache hits.)
But cumulative slowdowns from adding debugging lots of places that end up
all being used in the same tight loop is still something to keep an eye on.

With that said, it should be easy to add
additional debug info to most parts of git-annex now, so get in touch if
you have something specific you want debug info for. I'm closing this todo
here.
