echoing https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/9 \"parallel download of a file from multiple URLs (and special remotes?)\"
might be worth adding e.g.

git config annex.downloader.torrent.allowmultiple True

and then using downloader which could fetch from multiple originating URLs simultaneously.  In respect to aria2 (which seems to not support ATM specification of the output filename) see
https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/aria2/issues/190
