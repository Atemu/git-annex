Revisiting the idea of using different uuids with a sameas= parameter:

If one remote is marked dead, it ought to be the one that sameas= points
to, since that's the uuid in the location log. So that's ok.

As long as enableremote does not allow changing the sameas= paramter,
sameas loops could only occur maliciously, not in normal operation.
So it's fine to break such a loop in an arbitrary way.

There would need to be a way to prevent a remote with sameas= from being
used by a version of git-annex that does not support it. One way would be
to omit the name= parameter from remote.log, and use some other parameter
for the name. Then old git-annex could not initremote with the wrong uuid.

Using remote.name.annex-uuid-sameas=uuid instead of remote.name.annex-uuid
would prevent old git-annex from using initialized sameas remotes.

Seems that encryption parameter inheritance would happen the same way as
has been discussed above. When constructing the RemoteConfig, copy over the
encryption parameters from the parent remote.

All in all, using separate uuids instead of name= seems perhaps better.
