TBH, an exported tree can contain the same content in two files,
and the export database does contain information to deal with that;
the location log doesn't really need to be modified to support this.

Another way to look at it is that you want to build a larger tree, that
contains two or more trees in subdirectories, and export the larger tree
to the top of the remote. And if you look at this that way, it's
already possible to do what you want using only git commands like `git mktree`.
