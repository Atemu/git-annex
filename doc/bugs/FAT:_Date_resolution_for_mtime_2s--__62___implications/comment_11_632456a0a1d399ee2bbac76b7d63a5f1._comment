@martin, to the best of my knowledge and testing, what you're proposing `git annex add` do in this case is identical to what it already happens to do, except for the message displayed.

Do you have an example of it not doing that?

We seem to be talking past one-another, since I've now said three times this is what it does. And I've tested it twice.

I don't think that the current behavior of add, or your suggested behavior (which again, happens to be nearly identical) is sufficient to close this bug report with.
