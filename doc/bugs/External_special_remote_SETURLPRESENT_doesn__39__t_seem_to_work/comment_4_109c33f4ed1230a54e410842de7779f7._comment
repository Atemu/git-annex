Thinking some more, getting the external special remote program installed
may be the real pain point here.

I could easily add support for enableremote with readonly=yes, and have it
not use the external program at all, just hit the urls previously registered
with SETURLPRESENT.

The git-annex branch would bloat some if a remote works this way, but if
the urls consist mostly of some fixed strings, and the key, then git should
pack those pretty efficiently.
