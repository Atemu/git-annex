Create the new repository and then add the \"source\" repository as a [local cache](/tips/local_caching_of_annexed_files).

This will allow you to copy the symlinks to the new repository and `git annex get` the content, in any order you like, with all the safety precautions of git-annex. The fact that it came from the cache isn't stored either, so it is added cleanly!

I use this method very heavily and it works really well.
