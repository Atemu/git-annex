I've had a report of the assistant failing to commit when there are a lot
of files on OSX Yosemite.

<pre>
Committer crashed: git: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: resource exhausted (Argument list too long)
[2015-03-22 23:14:42 CET] Committer: warning Committer crashed: git: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: resource exhausted (Argument list too
long)
</pre>

Probably need to tune the command length limit for !linux. --[[Joey]]
