### Please describe the problem.
Using "--numcopies=N" on the command line doesn't overrides (as advertised) the annex.numcopies variable when set via .gitattributes. 

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

$ echo '* annex.numcopies=2' > .gitattributes

$ git annex drop --numcopies=1 somefile.txt

Second line fails if only one other copy exists.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 4.20130627
