### Please describe the problem.
The webapp configuration for enabling a new gitlab remote is out of date and no longer functions.

Attempt to use the webapp to create a new gitlab remote.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
6.20160229-g37a89cc on linux x86 fedora 18

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Git-annex is a miracle to find.  I intend to stick with it, migrate my life to it, and perhaps learn haskell some day to contribute.
