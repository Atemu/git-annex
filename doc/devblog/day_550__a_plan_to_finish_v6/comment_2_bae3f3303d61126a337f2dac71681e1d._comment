Well, `git annex add -J` works of course.. `git add` doesn't have a way to
parallelize, nor does git checkout.

It might be useful to parallelize `git annex smudge --update` which updates
unlocked files in the work tree. I guess it should already be mostly disk
bound when it's copying files and parallalizing that would likely only
worsten things due to seeking (on spinning rust), 
but it may have some parallizable overhead when it's making annex.thin hardlinks.
It would need to be controlled via a git config flag or something since
it gets run internally.
