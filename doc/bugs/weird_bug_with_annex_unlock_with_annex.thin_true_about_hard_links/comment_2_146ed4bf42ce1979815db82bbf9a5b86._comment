Hit this, too. dev-vcs/git-annex-6.20180529.
All files which are successfully hardlinked have executability bit not set. `chmod a-x *` eventually fixes hardlinking for almost all files, but interestingly, not for all. Also as I see executability permissions bit does not propagate through git commits with modechange.
