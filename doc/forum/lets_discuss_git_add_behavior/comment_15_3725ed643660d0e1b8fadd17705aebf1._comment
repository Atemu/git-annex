The best way to restore v5 semantics right now seems to be: (1) set `annex.largefiles=nothing` to prevent `git add` from annexing; (2) make an alias to use instead of `git annex add`, which temporarily sets `annex.largefiles` to whatever it normally would be and then calls `git-annex-add`.  But old scripts that call `git-annex-add` would need to be changed to call the alias.
