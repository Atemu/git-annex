### Please describe the problem.

[https://github.com/jwodder](https://github.com/jwodder) is cooking up OS X build recipe (+testing) in [datalad-extensions/pull/31](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/pull/31).  The test step where HOME is pointing to a crippled FS (see [workflow + scripts in PR](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/pull/31/files) for details of the setup) was running for 3h and I canceled it, so the [log]() showed

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

tired me failed to find a clear version printed anywhere  (will be added) but it happened earlier today so some state a few hours back from 8.20200908-9-g8955ac39f

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

depends on the weather, but I am a rain magnet.
