This strongly resembles ghc RTS bugs such as <http://bugs.debian.org/677096> (except that one got fixed, and affected the non-threaded RTS, while this is using the threaded RTS).

The assistant and the webapp are the same process. The only difference is whether a web browser is talking to it. Unless the other bug is regarding the CPU used by the web browser, that other bug is a duplicate of this one.
