It sounds like you would want to unlock all files in the repo this
way, is that right?

If so, it seems like a case for `git-annex adjust`, eg 
`git annex adjust --hardlink`. And it would perhaps make sense to do
that on a crippled filesystem by default instead of the current default of
--unlock.

Keeping it in adjust only avoids needing to make the unlock command do
something that is not an unlocking, and it avoids needing to add a new
command. 

It also neatly avoids the problem that, while `git annex unlock`
makes a change that can be committed to git (in v7 mode), this new
operation is not something that can be committed to git
(at least w/o some change to indicate it in the pointer file).
