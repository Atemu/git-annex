git-annex copy -A --to S3 -J40 hangs reproductibly for phibs (on irc).

When it hangs, at least one job is stuck at 100%, and often several,
though some other jobs are hung at smaller percent.

Without -J, it did not seem to hang. It also may have not been hung with
-J2 (was interrupted before finishing).

One attempt (with --json) had this message:

	magicFile: got error code but no error message

Two attempts had this:

	Missing root element

One time just before the hang, the other time 20+ files before the hang.
That message coes from Text.XML apparently,
which I think points to this being the same bug.

phibs tried a similar copy to a directory special remote, did not hang.

phibs tried the ResourceT strictness patch there and it did not help.
I think that pretty much rules out any problem in git-annex's code,
the problem is probably in the aws library or the http stack.

The S3 remote has chunking (10 mb) and no encryption, and is on AWS.

Some file sizes of files that hung at 100%: 64083380, 7668, 72792, 6952,
9584456, 21050948.
