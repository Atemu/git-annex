Hello everyone,
I need some help with this use-case: two local computers, paired with git annex, also sync in the cloud (box.com) to pull and push changes even when the other local computer is offline.

I've tried the following steps with the webapp, but the result isn't working so far:

1. Create repo in *Computer A* through the webapp.
2. Create repo in *Computer B* through the webapp.
3. In *Computer A*, add box.com repository and put it in the 'backup' group (Just to make sure that it gets everything but I've also tried re-doing the whole procedure with box.com set to 'transfer' (as suggested by the webapp), and still will not work).
4. Pair computer *A* and *B* over the local network. 
5. Now also enable box.com in *B* (the cloud repo has appeared thanks to pairing)

So far, when everyone is online, everything syncs correctly. Creating "file1" in *A*, will sync it to all repositories as shown by "git annex whereis file1".

The problem is that this won't work for the following use-case, which I'm currently trying to solve:

(continued from the previous steps)

6. *B* goes offline.
7. *A* creates a file (or makes a change), which is correctly synced to box.com (*whereis* shows that it's there too). As expected, syncing with B fails because B is offline.
8. *A* goes offline.
9. *B* come back online.

The expected behavior here is that B gets the new file (or change) from box.com, since it's been pushed there by *A*, but this doesn't happen. Strangely, the new file doesn't get in *B* until *A* comes back online.

**What am I missing? Should I do something differently to get this behavior?**

(This use-case is important for me because I need to keep some binary files in sync. These files are frequently modified by either *B* or *A*, and very often one of the two repos is not online. The different versions can't be simply merged back because of the binary nature of the files.)

Thanks everyone for your help.
