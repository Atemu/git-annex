Well, it could be a rmurl bug.

        whenM (null <$> getUrls key) $
                logChange key uuid InfoMissing

I think that might behave wrongly if an uri 
has been registered by a special remote, since the
list of urls would then not be empty. So it ought to filter out uris
that have an OtherDownloader.

And hmm, SETURLPRESENT adds an url to the list, doesn't mark it as present
in the web, but if you then did a `git annex addurl` to add an url to the web,
there would be two urls listed, so `git annex rmurl` of the url addurl added would
leave it marked present in the web because of the other url. Given the data
that's stored, that can't be handled any better. Fixing this would need to
add the uuid of the remote next to the url in the log file.
