Yes, it knows which remotes are configured, and every configured remote
that it's going to list will have been tried and not been accessible
when there's such a message. So, the list can be split into repos
that have a remote and those without one. Eg:

	  Try making some of these remotes accessible:
	    2370e576-fcef-11ea-a46e-7fce4739e70f -- joey@localhost:/media/usb [usbdrive]
	    346cad24-fcef-11ea-a275-d3951b734346 -- joey@server:repo [origin]
	    9808c3da-fcf0-11ea-b47f-cfa6e90a9d4a -- amazon S3
	  Maybe enable some of these special remotes (git annex enableremote):
	    e513795e-1311-431d-8106-917d9528cfbd -- datasets.datalad.org
	  Maybe add some of these git remotes (git remote add):
	    2cca1320-6f51-4acf-a778-efdc79f87ab3 -- smaug:/mnt/btrfs/datasets/datalad/crawl/labs/churchland/najafi-2018-nwb

So only 2 lines longer at most.

(The "Maybe" wording is because "And/or" is so ugly, and yet
the user may need to only do one, or more than one, depending on what
they're doing.)
