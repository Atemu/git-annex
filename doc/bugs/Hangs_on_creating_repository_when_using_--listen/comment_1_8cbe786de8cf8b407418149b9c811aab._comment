Thanks for looking into this.

Following your explanation there is no easy solution to this. I guess one could potentially grey out all actions in the webapp that lead to problems. But that might be overkill for a rare use case (which I assume the use of --listen with a given port is). Maybe just documenting for which use cases (repository creation, switching, ...?) the provided port will lead to problems (e.g. in the man page under the --listen section) is good enough (it is for me)?
