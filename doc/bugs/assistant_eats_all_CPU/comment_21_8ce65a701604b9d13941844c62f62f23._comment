This bug is about a particular sequence of system calls. It is not about every possible way that git-annex can use CPU! If you think you have reproduced this bug, you need to include a strace demonstrating the problem, or you're just adding noise.

@Thomas your log shows git-annex doing a git pull over XMPP. This will take CPU, as will any git pull. It is not related to this bug.

@myownlittl the assistant has to scan your repository when it's started to find any files you have modified since the last time it was run. That is not related to this bug. However, I will probably be adding a config knob to disable the startup scan.

@Oliver, you said you had seen this same bug on Ubuntu, but did not show a strace, so I don't know if you are really experiencing the same bug.
