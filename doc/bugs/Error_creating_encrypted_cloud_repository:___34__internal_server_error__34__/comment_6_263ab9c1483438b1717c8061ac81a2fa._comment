I have verified the gpg build I am currently using on OSX fails with that line. MacGPG doesn't but I had problems including it in the build before.
If you remove the \"cert\" and the \"pkg\" from the line it will work. It seems I need to update the gpg build to support these DNS based key finding methods.
