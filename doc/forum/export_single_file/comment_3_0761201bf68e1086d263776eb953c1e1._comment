`git annex export` only exports trees, but you can easily make a tree
containing only a single file, and then export that. 

For example:

	mkdir exporttree
	cp tests/tests1.mov exporttree
	git annex add exporttree
	git commit -m 'created export tree'
	git annex export master:exporttree --to public

If you don't want to commit that you can switch to a temporary branch
and build the tree there. Or there are plenty of lower-level git commands
to build trees.
