Also, it could check if annex.pidlock is already set globally, and skip the
probe. Which maybe would work for you? 

I'm going to implement both the delayed message, and checking
annex.pidlock.

(Timing out the probe after some period of time less than 2 minutes would
also be a possibility, but then there could be false positives on
filesystems that are just legitimately very slow. Doesn't seem a good
idea.)
