> I guess those are both marked as dead, since whereis skipps dead repos and doesn't show them.

Well, only `500G` should be marked as dead, not `1T` â€“ that is the repository I am working in!... 

And indeed, `git annex semitrust 1T` solved it.

Maybe at one point I had re-used uuids, because I was copying repositories?

So this might have been an issue with PEBKAC, although maybe git-annex could warn, for examle in `git annex fsck` or in other commands, if the current repository is marked dead, or in `git annex sync` if very much alive looking remotes are marked as dead.
