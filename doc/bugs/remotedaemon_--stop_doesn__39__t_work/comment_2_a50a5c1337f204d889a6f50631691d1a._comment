Given that there is one remotedaemon process per repository, if a user has (say) 10 of them running and wants to stop a particular one, what is the expectation of how they would do this?  Presumably it would involve something like searching the process table for a remotedaemon process whose cwd is the repository in question.  I can't think of any trivial one-liner to do this, since the usual suspects like `pkill` / `ps` / `pidof` etc. do not support filtering by cwd. 

So an advantage of implementing pidfiles and `--stop` would be that each user doesn't have to worry about such details.
