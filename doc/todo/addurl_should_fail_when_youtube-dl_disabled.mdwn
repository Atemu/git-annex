When using addurl on an url that youtube-dl supports, if it's installed but
not enabled to be used due to the recent security fix, git-annex will
download the web page and add it, which is unlikely to be desired behavior.
Instead, it should check if youtube-dl supports the page, and then error
out at the download stage, with a message that points at how to enable it.
