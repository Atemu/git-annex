This works fine with \"git annex addurl\". 

However, with --fast, it fails:

  git-annex: user error (https not supported)

This is because the Haskell HTTP library doesn't support https yet. <https://github.com/haskell/HTTP/issues/17> Seems to be very little momentum on fixing that, perhaps I need to switch the code to use http-enumerator, which does.
