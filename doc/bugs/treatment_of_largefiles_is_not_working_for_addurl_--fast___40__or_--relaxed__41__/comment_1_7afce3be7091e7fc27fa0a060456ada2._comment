Obviously --relaxed doesn't know the size of the file at all, so it
wouldn't know what to do for "largerthan".

--fast often knows the file size, but not always. When quvi is used, the
size is not included in the key. When a special remote claims an url, the
size may or may not be known.

So, annex.largefiles could be supported for --fast but not for --relaxed,
and only for urls not using quvi or some special remotes.
This seems so complicated to document that it's probably not a good idea.
Such complexity makes me start to wonder if I made a mistake by adding this
feature to addurl.

Also, adding support for this would complicate any later annex.largefiles
settings, like mime type matching, that need to look at the content of the
file.
