If I revert to a previous commit, the metadata changes are not reverted to their previous state.
Is there a way to revert metadata?
If I understood that correctly, the metadata are stored in a single git-annex branch: so there is no way to have two regular branches with different metadata for the same file, right?
Does any call to git-annex metadata creates a new commit in the git-annex branch?
The commit message of the git-annex branch are not super informative: they all say \"update\".

A related question: is there a way to get the git-annex branch commit that matches a regular/master branch commit?

Thanks.
