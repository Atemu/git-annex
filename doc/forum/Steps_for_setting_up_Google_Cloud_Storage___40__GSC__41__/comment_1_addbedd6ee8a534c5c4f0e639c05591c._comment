 subject="GCS using S3: removeKey when not present: FAIL "
 date="2020-05-14T20:39:21Z"
 content="""
I mostly got it to work but running: \"git annex testremote cloud\" is all green OKs except it produces one failure for each file of: fails with the message: removeKey when not present:                      FAIL (0.35s)

Annex was setup by:
git annex initremote --force cloud      type=S3      host=storage.googleapis.com protocol=https port=80 bucket=gitannex-datalad encryption=none
git annex wanted cloud \"anything\"

testremote cloud (generating test keys...) Remote Tests
  unavailable remote
