Add to the [[webapp]] some configuration of git-annex.

There are some basic settings that pass through to `git config`, things
like how much disk space to leave free, how many copies to ensure are kept
of files, etc.

The meat of the configuration will be in configuration assistants that walk
through setting up common use cases.

* Create a repository (run when the web app is started without a configured
  repository too).
* Clone this repo to a USB drive.
* Clone this repo to another host:
  1. Prompt for the hostname (or do avahi local machine discovery). 
  2. Enable the two hosts to ssh to one-another and run git-annex shell.
     (A tricky problem, if ssh keys need to be added to do that.)
  3. Push over a clone of the repository. (Using git-annex-shell?)
  4. Start [[syncing]].
* Set up Amazon S3.
* Set up rsync remote.
* Set up encryption.
* I lost my USB drive!
* etc -- many more possibilities
