The git-annex Windows port is not ready for prime time. But it does exist
now! --[[Joey]] 

## status

* Does not work with Cygwin's build of git (that git does not consistently
  support use of DOS style paths, which git-annex uses on Windows). 
  Must use Msysgit.
* rsync special remotes are known buggy.
* Bad file locking, it's probably not safe to run more than one git-annex
  process at the same time on Windows.
* Ssh connection caching does not work on Windows, so `git annex get`
  has to connect twice to the remote system over ssh per file, which
  is much slower than on systems supporting connection caching.
* `git annex watch` works, but does not detect when files are still open
  for write as they're being added (no lsof). So watch/webapp/assistant
  may be unsafe.
* `git annex assistant` has not been tested, is probably quite incomplete.
* Assistant is known to not transfer any files.  
  (transferrer doesn't built yet)  
  Need a createPipe for windows. See the mkAnonPipe in
  System.Process source. (cbits/runProcess.c)
* No XMPP support (needs a lot of C libraries which are available in
  cygwin, but pkg-config does not list them once installed).
* Doesn't daemonize. Maybe use
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Win32-services>
  or perhaps easier,
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Win32-services-wrapper>
