Found this in the changelog:

  * webapp: When adding another local repository, and combining it
    with the current repository, the new repository's remote path
    was set to "." rather than the path to the current repository.
    This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.

I guess this is a similar problem, although it seems that the "." in your case
made it into `~/.config/git-annex/autostart`

I found two ways to do that. One is to tell the webapp to make a repository, and
enter "." as the repository location. The other, which is probably what you
did, is to go to Configuration -> Preferences and uncheck "Auto start", save
and then go back and check it. This wrongly puts in a "." instead of the full
repo path.

I've fixed all code paths to force absolute paths in the autostart file,
and made any relative paths that got in there be ignored.
