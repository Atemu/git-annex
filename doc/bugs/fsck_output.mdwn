When you check several files and the fsck fails, you get confusing output:

<pre>
O fsck test1 (checksum...) 
E  Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies of test1 exist.
E  Back it up with git-annex copy.
O
O failed
O fsck test2 (checksum...) 
E  Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies of test2 exist.
E  Back it up with git-annex copy.
O 
O failed
</pre>

The newline is in the wrong place and confuses the user. It should be printed _after_ "failed".

> This is a consequence of part of the output being printed to stderr, and
> part to stdout. I've marked the lines above with E and O.
