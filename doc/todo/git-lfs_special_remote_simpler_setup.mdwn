It would be nice if a clone from eg, gitlab could autoenable the git-lfs
special remote. Currently, autoenable doesn't work for git-lfs special
remotes at all, because the url is not stored.

What if, an url or urls passed to initremote were stored. Then when
enableremote/autoenable runs, if it sees a git remote with a known url,
it sets that remote up with annex-uuid and annex-git-lfs set, instead of
adding a new remote.

That might need changes to the Remote setup method, not sure.

Problem: Many urls could be used to clone. http and ssh are the obvious
two. url=http:// url=ssh:// won't work, only one value will be used.
url1= url2= is annoying for the user, especially if they later want to add
another url with enableremote and have to work out the number.

Problem: The user might go in and change the remote's url to point to some
other server with a different git-lfs backend. In fact, they could already
do so! Remembering the urls actually would let the special remote detect
this; it can check if its remote's url is one that it knows about, and
refuse to use it otherwise.
