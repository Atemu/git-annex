[[design/external_special_remote_protocol/async_appendix]] has a draft
protocol extension.

I improved on the design, so any and all requests can be handled async,
or  sequentially, as the external special remote prefers. Had to add async
job ids, but the protocol simplicity was worth it.

(Implementation will be something like, a thread relaying to and from the
special remote, with requests sent to it when it's not blocked, and with
its async replies sent back to the corresponding requester based on the
JobId.)
