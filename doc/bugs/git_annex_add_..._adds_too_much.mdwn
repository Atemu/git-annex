When a hidden file (starting with a dot) is git-annex add'ed, other non-tracked files are also added 

What steps will reproduce the problem?

$ touch a .b

$ git annex add .b

add a (checksum...) ok

add .b (checksum...) ok

(Recording state in git...)


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Only file .b should be added.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20120406
(same problem with version 3.20120123) on Debian.
