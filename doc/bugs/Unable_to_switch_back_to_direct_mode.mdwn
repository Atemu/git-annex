### Please describe the problem.

I seem to be unable to switch back and forth between git annex direct and git annex indirect mode in one of my repositories.  I can in others just fine.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

In the broken repository I can do:

    cwebber@earlgrey:~/gfx-proj/mediagoblin_vid$ git annex direct
    commit  
    add audio/part2.aup (checksum...) ok
    ok
    add images/campaign.png (checksum...) ok
    ok
    add images/transifex.png (checksum...) ok
    ok
    add script-lines.txt (checksum...) ok
    ok
    add vid_pitch.blend (checksum...) ok
    ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    [master 9f13dc0] commit before switching to direct mode
     1 file changed, 145 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
     rewrite audio/part2.aup (100%)
     mode change 120000 => 100644
    ok
    direct gavroche-vid-shot.blend 
    git-annex: /home/cwebber/gfx-proj/mediagoblin_vid/.git/annex/objects/3M/mx/SHA256E-s2935980--3a1c838333a4a0ee1eaa837c3f08a910d3f29fc60baf41affd936fbefe11111f/SHA256E-s2935980--3a1c838333a4a0ee1eaa837c3f08a910d3f29fc60baf41affd936fbefe11111f: rename: permission denied (Permission denied)
    failed
    git-annex: direct: 1 failed

looking at the files:

    cwebber@earlgrey:~/gfx-proj/mediagoblin_vid$ ls -l gavroche-vid-shot.blend
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 cwebber cwebber 190 Apr 28 18:27 gavroche-vid-shot.blend -> .git/annex/objects/3M/mx/SHA256E-s2935980--3a1c838333a4a0ee1eaa837c3f08a910d3f29fc60baf41affd936fbefe11111f/SHA256E-s2935980--3a1c838333a4a0ee1eaa837c3f08a910d3f29fc60baf41affd936fbefe11111f

... it looks like these permissions should be fine!

Some notable things:

* I believe Blender wrote directly to a file that was in "locked" somehow, despite it being in that state.  It may have actually followed the symlink and overwritten that file, I'm not sure.
* However, the file that git-annex is now reporting with "permission denied" is not the one it did previously... I did git checkout -- on all the files, switched them over, and it's a different set of broken things now!
* It's actually easy enough to fix... in fact, I did fix it!  I just did a fresh clone of the git repository and a git annex get and everything is fine now.  However, it seemed like possibly a bug that might hit other people, hence my reporting it.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git annex version 4.20130417 on debian wheezy
