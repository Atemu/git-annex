If you are a user of AOL mailing client then this thread is for you. Being a user I found many bugs by which it was insane for me to use and then I found some sort of solution by which you get rid of these bugs. Firstly check your internet connection if that is working properly then uninstall the app and re-install it. After then it does not work, check out all the setting of the AOL system. If after doing all these steps and yet your mail not working properly or any other services provided by AOL are not working properly then follow on <a href="https://emailsupports.net/how-to-fix-aol-mail-on-android-not-working/">AOL mail on android not working<a/>.
