There's not currently a way to do per-file youtube-dl options.
The difficulty is that we don't know what youtube-dl options might be
unsafe, and which such a feature could make eg `git annex get` use when run
by a different user.

I feel that this needs some support in youtube-dl to avoid git-annex
needing to know about all its safe options. Especially since which options
are available, or safe, could vary between versions of youtube-dl.
