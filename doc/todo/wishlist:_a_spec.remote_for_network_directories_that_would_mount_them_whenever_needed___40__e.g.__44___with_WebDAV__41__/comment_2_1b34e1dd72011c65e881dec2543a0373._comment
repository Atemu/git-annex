I see, thanks for pointing at these config options! Perhaps, that'll be enough.

I'll have to see whether the information on how to access the remote copy (the source URL and how to mount it) saved in config variables will be transferred to the clones of the repo.

AFAIU [[location tracking]], usually, git-annex would transfer the information on where to look for copies from one repo to another.
