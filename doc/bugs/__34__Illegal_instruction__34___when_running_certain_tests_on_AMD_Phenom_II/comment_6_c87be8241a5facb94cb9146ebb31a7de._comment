git-annex does not use blake2 by default. If someone has configured it to
use blake2 (probably because they want the speed) and added some files to 
a repo, it will then use blake2 to hash those files going forward.

So, in balance, it seems better to disable the unsafe optimisation,
and have it be a little bit slower, than not work on some machines.

Thanks for fileing the issue on cryptonite. I don't see anything further to
be done in git-annex, so I'll close this bug now.
