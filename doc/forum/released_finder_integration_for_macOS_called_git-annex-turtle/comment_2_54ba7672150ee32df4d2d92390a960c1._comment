Thanks for the positive feedback!

>Please do file todo requests if there are interface improvements that git-annex can offer to query for the data you need.

Will do. I think I have most of the queries I need right now. I really wanted to show nice, meaningful icons for folders; I ended up showing some measure of the number of copies of all files contained within folders. This is something I decided to cache in a database since, to my knowledge, neither git nor git-annex tracks folders directly. I don't think it would make sense to cache folder level queries in git-annex anytime soon?


>But I do wonder if it would make sense for the git-annex.app to bundle git-annex-turtle, so users don't need that extra step.

Great! Yes, that sounds like an excellent idea! Yes, as you mentioned git-annex-turtle.app is ~30mb with all the icon assets. I believe this is because the icons are uncompressed PDFs exported from Adobe Illustrator, oops. I'll see if I can compress them and get the .app size down. Currently, zipping git-annex-turtle.app brings down the size to ~8mb.

Thanks,

â€”Andrew
