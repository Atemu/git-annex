### Please describe the problem.

I'm using accessing to a repo with sshfs, but I noticed hooks do not get executed. I noticed the permissions of hooks created by git-annex were all set to 700 (while the default .sample hooks seem to be 755). Is it intended?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

(example)
[[!format sh """
$ git checkout 'adjusted/master(unlocked)'
Updating files: 100% (3499/3499), done.
Switched to branch 'adjusted/master(unlocked)'
hint: The '.git/hooks/post-checkout' hook was ignored because it's not set as executable.
hint: You can disable this warning with `git config advice.ignoredHook false`.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 8.20201103, on Debian sid

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

git-annex is super great :-)
