thank you. I workaround this by using the DNS hostname instead the IPv6 address directly. But this is not a nice solution, like any workaround. But now i have problems with `git annex get` over IPv6-only:

```
get ***.mp3 (not available) 
  Try making some of these repositories available:
  	5636aefa-c509-4ea0-bebe-f5b96d8eb15a -- hserver
failed
<snip>
```

but i can ping it:
```
thomas@alus:~/Musik$ ping6 hserver.h.b128.net

```
(the high pings are caused by a download from an other source. Also i have no problems with rsync over IPv6)

PS: the markdown for code blocks is not working too :)
