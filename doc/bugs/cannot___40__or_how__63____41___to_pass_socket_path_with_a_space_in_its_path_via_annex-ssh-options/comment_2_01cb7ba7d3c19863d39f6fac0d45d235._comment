Is this still something you need, or does `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` cover the use
case?

The missing case would be, if you need remote.name.annex-ssh-options,
to pass the options only to that one remote and not others.

I don't feel it would be a good idea for git-annex to try to parse quoted
options, etc. It would need to expose the config to the shell, the same way
it implements GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, by wrapping the original command in "sh
-c".

That would need to be a different config than ssh-options, because
existing ssh-options might be broken by the change. Eg, if it is set to
something containing a "$", that would not be exposed to the shell
currently.

So, while this is clearly a gap, I'd prefer to only implement a fix if it's
actually needed. Since the bug report is 3 years old and I've not gotten a
nudge, I'm guessing maybe not needed..
