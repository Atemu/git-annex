### Please describe the problem.

Lately I have been building my own git-annex binary for Windows from source ([[install/fromsource]])
just to keep myself on edge, so to speak, and usually I don't have a problem doing that with
the `stack setup` & `stack build` method under PowerShell (v7.1.0) if I choose a tagged commit
from Git Annex's git repo. However, this latest release doesn't seem to build without additional minor
coaxing/editing of the Haskell source due to type mismatches. I don't really know Haskell but I have
some rudimentary understanding of the ML family of languages, so I went ahead and peppered the troublesome
points of code with some invocations of `fromRawFilePath` and `toRawFilePath` to please the GHC
gods. Additionally, I cherry-picked commit `bce8865` on top of my own corrections to make things work.
This indeed allowed the code to compile but then the part of the testsuite which I exercised,
namely the "Unit Tests v8" set failed completely due to not being able to init the annex. The gist of
the matter is that git-annex.exe complains thusly:
"git-annex.exe: System.PosixCompat.Files.removeLink: not supported: illegal operation".

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Checking out tag `8.20201116`, making the corrections in the diff below, and then building with `stack setup`
and `stack build` (with no extras enabled, not even libmagic/MagicMime); finally testing the resulting binary
within *Git Bash* (in a folder like `c:\annx`) in the following fashion:

[[!format sh """
$ pwd
/c/annx

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I've been trying out Git Annex for a number of years but only for a year now I've had a nice use case for it
with archiving/mirroring my Macrium Reflect backup files (multi-gigabyte disk images with .mrimg extension)
to a secondary drive. Obviously because I'm on Windows I use adjusted branches a lot (even
`git-annex adjust --hide-missing --unlock`) with the `annex.thin` set to true so I rely on basic v8 features
to just work. I haven't tried special remotes yet, so I'm not at the moment concerned about that part of Git
Annex -- my use case is more like local archiving and stuff. Git Annex does give me some rigor to how I move
my backup files around and it's always nice to have an external checksum (I use MD5E w/Annex) recorded
"in the system" so that you can be sure your files are not altered due to bit rot, etc. In any case,
big thanks go to Joey (et al.) for this wonderful tool you made!
