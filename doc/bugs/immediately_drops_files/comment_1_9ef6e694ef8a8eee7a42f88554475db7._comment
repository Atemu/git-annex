You are running the git annex assistant, which takes care of getting and dropping files as it's configured to do, and you are then going in and manually running `git annex get`. If the assistant sees a file's content has appeared, and that file is in a directory that it has been configured to not want the content of file in (the `archive` directory by default), it will immediately try to drop it.

The only thing I don't understand is why the number of `..` in the symlink would change.
