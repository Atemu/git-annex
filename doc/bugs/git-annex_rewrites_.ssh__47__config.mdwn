### Please describe the problem.
Running git annex assistant, my .ssh/config file is rewritten. First, it is a symlink, but then git-annex makes it into an actual file. Second, it adds a trailing whitespace to a generic host block:

    Host
        ForwardAgent no
        ...

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
For the symlink, just make .ssh/config a symlink to the real thing. Have a generic host block will add trailing whitespace. Starting git annex assistant will rewrite .ssh/config.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex-5.20140717-8.fc24.x86_64

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Has worked wonders for syncing keepass files between devices; just now setting up assistant to do things automatically though :) .
