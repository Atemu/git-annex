the problem here is that it upgrading the repo will not work on a readonly filesystem, so we can't upgrade, we can't get files, so we can't sync.

we should be able to sync anyways - can't we try our best shot at getting files even without upgrading the metadata? i mean i'm looking for something in .git/annex/objects/, maybe i don't care about tracking so much - i just want to recover some files...
