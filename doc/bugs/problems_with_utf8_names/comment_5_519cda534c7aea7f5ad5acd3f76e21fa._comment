I also encountered Adam's bug. The problem seems to be that communication with the git process is done with `Char8`-bytestrings. So, when `L.unpack` is called, all filenames that git outputs (with `ls-files` or `ls-tree`) are interpreted to be in latin-1, which wreaks havoc if they are really in UTF-8.

I suspect that it would be enough to just switch to standard `String`s (or `Data.Text.Text`) instead of bytestrings for textual data, and to `Word8`-bytestrings for pure binary data. GHC should nowadays handle locale-dependent encoding of `String`s transparently.
