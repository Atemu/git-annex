You can temporarily enable annex-ignore for a remote.

For example:

git -c remote.horus.annex-ignore=true git annex drop ...

Adjusting the annex-cost of the remote may also be useful, so git-annex
will avoid using that remote when it can use a lower-cost remote instead.
The annex-cost-command could be used to detect the network where the remote
access times out and make its cost be very high then.
