### Please describe the problem.

When pairing two machines with git-annex assistant, the assistant kept asking for the ssh password.  Checking the git-annex daemon logs, I saw that ssh was refusing to use the key the assistant had created because it was group readable (see below for the log extract).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

The assistant was installed from the ubuntu precise ppa backport on an up-to-date copy of ubuntu precise.
It was started using "git-annex webapp --listen=XYZ".
This was done on two machines on the same network.
Created a repository using the web-app, the same on both machines.
Did a pair request.  This initially worked fine, until it got to the point of using ssh, when it started asking for the password many many  times.
