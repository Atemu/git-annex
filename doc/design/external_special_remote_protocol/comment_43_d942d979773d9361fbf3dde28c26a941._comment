Notice that the --debug flag shows how this protocol is flowing in
both directions.

	<-- TRANSFER STORE ...
	--> TRANSFER-SUCCESS STORE ...

The first line was sent from git-annex to the external special remote

This is very handy for understanding when something strange seems to be
happening with the protocol.
