Running the tip of the watch branch on OSX in an annex'ed directory.

The watch command detects the changes, does _something_, see the output below.

Output from watch command

<pre>
(Recording state in git...)
Added "./KeePass2.18.dmg"
Added "./KeePassX-0.4.3.dmg"
add ./KeePass2.18.dmg (checksum...) ok
add ./KeePassX-0.4.3.dmg (checksum...) ok
</pre>

State of the annex

<pre>
laplace:annex jtang$ git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	KeePass2.18.dmg
#	KeePassX-0.4.3.dmg
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>

It seems to not do a git add and commit after the creation of the symlinks, manually doing this makes it all happy again till more files are added.

note: i had posted a comment in the blog post, but posting the issue here is probably more appropriate.
