## what
After starting the assistant, daemon.log is being spammed with "accept: unsupported operation (Function not implemented)" due to dbus failing.

## version
[[!format sh """
$ git-annex version
git-annex version: 5.20131224-g6ca5271
"""]]
(The armel standalone)

## question
Is this detrimental to the assistant?

## partial daemon.log
