What steps will reproduce the problem?

    try to unlock a file in a git annex checkout

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

    % git annex unlock FILENAME
    unlock FILENAME (copying...) cp: illegal option -- -
    usage: cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file target_file
           cp [-R [-H | -L | -P]] [-fi | -n] [-apvX] source_file ... target_directory
    git-annex: copy failed!

    (should unlock the file)

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

    latest git annex osx build as of yesterday (12-11-03)
