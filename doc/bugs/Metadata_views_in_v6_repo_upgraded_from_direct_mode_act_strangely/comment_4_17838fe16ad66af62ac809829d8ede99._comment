`git annex adjust --hide-missing` is now available to do what you want
re hiding missing files.

`git annex view` doesn't currently unlock files in a v6 repo, so it's not
usable on a crippled filesystem. That's why the cat in the transcript above
shows the symlink content which git writes to a regular file when in a
crippled filesystem.

I would like to eventually unify adjust with view, so `git annex adjust
--unlock` can be used with a view, which would support that.
See [[todo/unify_adjust_with_view]].
