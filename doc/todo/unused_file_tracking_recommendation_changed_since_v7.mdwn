I might be wrong, but I believe this stopped working since "pointer files" are used in v7 smudge/clean filters and [[tips/unlocked files]]:

    $ git annex unused
    unused . (checking for unused data...) (checking kingston/master...) (checking kingston/adjusted/master(unlocked)...) (checking master...) 
      Some annexed data is no longer used by any files:
        NUMBER  KEY

        [...]

    (To see where data was previously used, try: git log --stat -S'KEY')
      
      To remove unwanted data: git-annex dropunused NUMBER
      
    ok

Indeed, -S doesn't find anything here. I suspect that is because git's
smudge/clean interface kicks in in `--stat`. The above text should add
the `--no-textconv` argument to avoid that. At least it works here. :)
