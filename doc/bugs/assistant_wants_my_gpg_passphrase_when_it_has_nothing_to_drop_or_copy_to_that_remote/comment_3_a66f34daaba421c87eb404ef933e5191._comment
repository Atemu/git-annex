How is this rsync remote configured? Is it configured as a transfer remote? If not, the assistant's default behavior is to sync all files to it, and since you say the file is not there, it'd make sense it would start transferring it to there on startup.

OTOH, this could be a complete red herring. You haven't shown me the log file. Perhaps the drop you're seeing in the log is before the operation that is asking for the GPG passphrase. I can't tell until you show me the log.
