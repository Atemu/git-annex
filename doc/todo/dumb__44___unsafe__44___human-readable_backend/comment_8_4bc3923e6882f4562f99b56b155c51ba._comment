Your suggestion was not practical though, because the regular special
remote interface does not allow all necessary operations for that. 
The exporttree interface is the minimal API extension that supports this.

And picking which tree to export and how necessarily involves an additional
user interface, `git annex exporttree` is that. Once it's set up you can
use the `git annex sync --content` interface at least.
