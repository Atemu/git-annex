The standalone linux tarball will work on 64 or 32 bit systems, as long as they are capable of linking 32 bit elf executables. I cannot test if Arch Linux is incapable of this.

I'm getting a bit tired of wild tangents, can we you just find someplace, be it a Debian chroot or whatever, to run the standalone linux tarball and test if DAV works there?
