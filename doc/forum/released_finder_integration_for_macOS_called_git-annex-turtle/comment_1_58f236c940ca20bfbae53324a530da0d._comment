Thanks very much for building this. It looks great.

I especially appreciated the notes in DESIGN.md about how it uses git-annex
interfaces and what is fast/too slow. Please do file todo requests if there
are interface improvements that git-annex can offer to query for the data
you need.

I suppose it does not make sense to integrate the code into git-annex,
as is done for the much simpler Nautilus and Konqueror file
manager integration. git-annex-turtle is something like 33M large with all
the assets, and has a significant quantity of source code that I would 
only get in the way of maintaining.

And it looks like it's easy enough to install it from the zip file.
But I do wonder if it would make sense for the git-annex.app to bundle
git-annex-turtle, so users don't need that extra step. What do you think?
