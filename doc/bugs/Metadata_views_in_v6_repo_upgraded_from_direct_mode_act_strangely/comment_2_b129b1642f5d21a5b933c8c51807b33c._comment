This has nothing to do with direct mode or v6, or the filesystem.
It is behaving more or less as intended.

Filenames in views are always mangled to make them guaranteed to be 
unique, since two files with base name "foo" could be collected into the
same view directory. This is done by embedding the directory structure
inside the filename as you show.

In the specific case of "/=*" that is not necessary since the view
is replicating the full directory structure. But most views do need
the mangling, and I feel it's better to always do the mangling than try to
work out when it's not needed.

And "/=*" is a mostly not useful edge case in the actual useful functionality
of views. Note my comment in the http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/How_to_hide_broken_symlinks/
forum post; it's not really a good way to hide missing files.
