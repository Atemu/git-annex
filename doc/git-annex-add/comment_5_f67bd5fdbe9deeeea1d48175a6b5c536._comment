You use `git-annex add` when you have a file located
inside your git-annex repository, which you want to check in.

You use `git-annex import` when you have some other thing
storing files and you want git-annex to learn about the files stored there.
Using git-annex import to move individual files to the repository and add
them is not significantly different than mv+add and will eventually be
deprecated.
