What you can do is run `git annex whereis` on the file,
and paste the url to `git annex addurl`. Once it downloads it to a 
new file, you can rename that over top of the old file.

(BTW, `git annex importfeed --fast` uses the URL backend,
which you mentioned you did not want to use. Easily dealt with
by running `git annex migrate` on the files.)
