When maintaining several replica of the same git-annex repo "git annex sync" is quite handy.
But it would be even handier if "git annex sync" would also perform automatic "git merge synced/*" actions on all remotes.

Clearly, this is beneficial when the user wants to keep all working copies synchronized.
This is likely the case in git annex assistant like scenarios. And it's always the case in my day to day scenarios :-)
I'm not sure about other use cases that I've hard time imagining...

As just discussed on IRC (#vcs-home/OFTC), this could be implemented in various ways:

1) By doing ssh on each remote and running the appropriate "git merge ..." commands there.
   The drawback of this is that quite often it won't be permitted to ssh on the remote and run arbitrary commands there.

2) Having a default post-receive hook, created at the time of "git annex init" that automatically does the merges when contacted by other remotes as a consequence of "git annex sync".


Thanks for git-annex!
