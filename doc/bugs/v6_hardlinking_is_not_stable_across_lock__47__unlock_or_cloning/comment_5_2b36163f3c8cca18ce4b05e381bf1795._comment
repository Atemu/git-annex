[[!commit b7c8bf5274a64389ac87d6ce0388b8708c261971]] is where that was
implemented. Interestingly, its commit message does say that the annex
object file is made executable when using annex.thin.
And indeed, git add of an executable file with annex.thin set does
make the object executable and hard link to it.

But that commit contains this line that avoids hard linking:

	        | maybe False isExecutable destmode = copy =<< getstat

Which is what I based my earlier comment on. But without that line,
AFAIK it will behave the way you want, with the annex object and
executable worktree file being hard linked. The code also removes the
execute bit if the annex object file later ends up getting hard linked
instead to a non-executable file.

So, based on this analysis, I'm going to remove that line. And improve the
annex.thin docs slightly, and I think that's sufficient to close this bug.
