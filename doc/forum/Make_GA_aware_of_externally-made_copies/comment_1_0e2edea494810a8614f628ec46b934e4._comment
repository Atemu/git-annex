Hi,
I tested it with `encryption=shared` and it works, but not with chunking. When creating the 2nd remote, you have to look up the cipher of the first one with `git cat-file blob git-annex:remote.log` and pass it to initremote with `cipher=`. Finally, after externally copying everything from the 1st remote to the 2nd remote, you have to run `git annex fsck --fast --all --from=remote2` to make git-annex aware of the copies.
