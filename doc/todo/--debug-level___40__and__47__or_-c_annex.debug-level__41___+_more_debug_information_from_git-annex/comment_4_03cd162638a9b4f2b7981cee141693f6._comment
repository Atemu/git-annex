I benchmarked calls to debugM when no debug output is enabled,
and it looks like around 1 million can be made per second
on my netbook. So if a 1% slowdown due to debugging is acceptable (which
seems a bit above the upper bound to me), that would allow 10 thousand
debugM calls per second.

Current call rate is probably always under 10 per second. Keeping it
out of tight loops would probably be sufficient.

Once place I sometimes wish had debugging is reads from the git-annex
branch. But running eg "git-annex get --from foo" in a repository with
many thousands of files, none of them in foo, does tends of 
thousands of reads per second in a tight loop. Benchmarked
that command with debugM of reads added, and it was 0.05% slower
than without debugM.

So, to add debugM there, would need to do what comment #3 discussed.
