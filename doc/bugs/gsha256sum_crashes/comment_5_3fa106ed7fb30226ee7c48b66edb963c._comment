Searching for \"OSX SIGILL\" finds rather a lot of reports of problems like this.

> My libraries were built using homebrew. By default homebrew optimizes for native architecture, resulting in machine instructions that don't work on older machines.

Suggests to me that the OSX autobuilder probably needs to run the build with PATH set to a directory with un-optimised builds (or fat binary builds?) of all the utilities included in the app. Seems we're lucky and git-annex itself is not built with whatever sort of optimisations (SSE?) is causing this.
