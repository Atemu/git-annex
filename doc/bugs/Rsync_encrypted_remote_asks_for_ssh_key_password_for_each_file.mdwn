What steps will reproduce the problem?

Add an encrypted rsync remote by it's 'Host' value in ~/.ssh/config.

eg.:

cat ~/.ssh/config | grep Host

    Host serverNick

git annex initremote rsyncRemote type=rsync rsyncurl=serverNick:/home/USER/Music encryption=USER@gmail.com

git annex copy some\ artist --to serverNick


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I'd expect it to remember the key password like a normal ssh remote.  Instead I get asked for the key password 3 times for each file in the folder.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20130216.  Arch x64 (up to date as of 2013-03-07)
