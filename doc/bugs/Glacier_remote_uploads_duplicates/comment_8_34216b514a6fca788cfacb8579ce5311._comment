The duplicates script fails because the BSD/MacOS version of uniq doesn't support the -D option.

You can work around this by installing the GNU version using Homebrew ('brew install coreutils') and then replacing the 'uniq' in the script with 'guniq' (Homebrew prefixes the coreutils with \"g\" by default).

I seem to still be running in to this bug using git annex version 4.20131106 and 'git annex copy --to glacier' without the '--not --in glacier' flags.  It's not a problem to use the extra flags but I wasn't originally aware of this issue and the duplicates don't seem to always occur.  I'll do some more testing and see whether I can reliably predict what will create duplicates and what won't.
