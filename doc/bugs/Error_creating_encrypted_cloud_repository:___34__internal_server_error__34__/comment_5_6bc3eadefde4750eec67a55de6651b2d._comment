OK (you just generated 1 byte of base64-encoded random data).
No, I'm afraid git-annex will croak for each operation using gpg on your remote (which includes get, push, fsck, ...).

This lines specifies how gpg automatically retrieves public keys when you get a signed message for instance. If you don't want to mix configurations, it is easy to create a git-annex-specific GnuPG home directory, but it requires you to point the `GNUPGHOME` to this alternative directory before starting git-annex.

That said, other MacOSX users have encountered the same problem, and it was [[reported_to_be_solved_recently|/bugs/internal_server_error_when_choosing_encrypted_rsync_repo_option/]].
