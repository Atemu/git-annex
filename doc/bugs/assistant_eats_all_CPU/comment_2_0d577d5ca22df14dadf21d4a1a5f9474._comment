Humm... it doesn't look like #677096 is fixed in wheezy, are you sure this isn't the problem I am seeing?

I am considering upgrading this machine to jessie soon, would that help diagnosing the problem?

Regarding the other bug, if you are refering to [[webapp takes 100% of the cpu]], i do believe it's a different issue because the CPU usage is lower in the assistant when it's *not* transfering lots of small files.
