Git Annex has been and is a terrific tool. And, I would, very respectfully, like to +1 the comments above.   I agree with spwhitton that v7 `git add` behavior would benefit from being off by default, with a way to turn it on as required.  Both from a migration safety/friction-reduction standpoint, but also from the least invasive integration with Git principle that amindfv and others have so well articulated.
