I've long been unsatisfied with the amount of effort needed to maintain the
Android port in its current state, the hacky cross-compiler toolchain 
needs days of wasted work to update, and is constantly out of date and
breaking in one way or other. This sucks up any time I might spare to
actually improve the Android port.

So, it was quite a surprise yesterday when I downloaded the git-annex
standalone Linux tarball into the Termux Android shell and unpacked it, and
it more or less worked!

The result, after a [[few minor fixes|todo/termux_package]], works 
just as well as the git-annex Android app, and probably better. Even the 
webapp works well, and with the Termux:Boot app, it can even
autostart the assistant on boot as a daemon. If you want to give it a
try, see [[tips/install_on_Android_in_Termux]].

So, I am leaning toward deprecating the android port for this, removing 14
thousand lines of patches and android-specific code. Not going to do it
just yet, but I feel a weight lifting...
