Need to support annex.largefiles when importing a tree from a special
remote.

Note that the legacy `git annex import` from a directory does honor
annex.largefiles.

The tricky bit might be that the largefiles matcher will need to run on
the temporary annex key that's used to import, before calculating the real
annex key; there's no corresponding file in the working tree. Also,
a "branch:subdir" at the command line or in
remote.name.annex-tracking-branch can change the path
that the file is being imported to, which needs to be communicated to the
largefiles matcher.
