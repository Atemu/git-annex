unix-2.6.0.1 is a very old version of that package, and unix-2.7.1.0 is
included with the version of ghc used by the android build.

So, it seems that some dependency mess is causing cabal to try to install a
second, old version of unix. Which can't possibly work.

This is apparently happening in the host ghc setup, not the cross compiling
ghc setup.
