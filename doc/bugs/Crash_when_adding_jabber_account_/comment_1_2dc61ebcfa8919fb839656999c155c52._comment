Are you using the 64 bit or the 32 bit build? Did you download the standalone tarball? How are you running git-annex exactly? (Using runshell, or by hand?)

A segfault here seems likely to involve the Haskell GNUTLS binding. At least, the only other time git-annex has segfaulted, which also involved jabber, it was a bug in the GNUTLS binding.
