Ah, that theory was right. I unplugged my iphone thus cutting my internet off, and the file is gone indeed.
Does that mean we can ignore this problem? I'm only sporadically online via internet cafes and to check emails at night via iphone.

Can't say whether git annex is working or not, still trying to figure out how it all works so I have only put a relatively small folder into the local repo and created a full backup S3 repo as well as an archive one on box.com
