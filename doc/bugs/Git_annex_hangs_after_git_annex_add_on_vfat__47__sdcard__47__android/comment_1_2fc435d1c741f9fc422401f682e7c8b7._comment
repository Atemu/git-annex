Comparing straces from Android and Linux, it seems to be due to git check-attr outputting something different:

<pre>
read(16, \"andro\0annex.backend\0unspecified\0\"..., 8096) = 66
read(10, \"linux: annex.backend: unspecifie\"..., 8096) = 70
</pre>

So, this is not actually Android specific, thankfully. It's just a breakage caused by a change in a newish version of git! I think it's not yet released, just Android is building from git head right now.

I have reverted the Android stable build to the last version I think won't be affected by this.
