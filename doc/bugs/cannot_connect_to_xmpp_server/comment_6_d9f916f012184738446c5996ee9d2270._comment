If the initiating entity includes in the initial stream header the 'version' attribute set to a value of at least \"1.0\" (see Section 4.7.5), after sending the response stream header the receiving entity MUST send a <features/> child element 

-- <http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6120.html#streams-negotiation>\"

By my reading this XMPP server is not RFC compliant. It's not clear to me if there's a good way for the XMPP client
to cater to XMPP servers that neglect to send at least an empty features tag.
