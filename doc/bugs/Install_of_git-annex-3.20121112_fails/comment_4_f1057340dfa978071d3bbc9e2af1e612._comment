Thank you Joey. Than I tried a workaround. On one machine I don't need the Webapp.

I was using 

cabal install --only-dependencies -f-Webapp
cabal configure -f-Webapp

mp/Utility/libdiskfree.o dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/libmounts.o ./git-annex.hs

Assistant/Alert.hs:21:8:
    Could not find module `Yesod'
    Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
