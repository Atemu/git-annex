It's true that you can currently use git-annex config to set absolutely any
value, but git-annex only looks at the values that are listed in the
documentation.

I suppose I'll change it to reject other values.

So, you say it works, but I still don't understand the behavior you
originally reported. Have you somehow fixed it? Or just not reproduced it
with your new from scratch repository?
