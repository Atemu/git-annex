The most likely cause of this error is a bad `~/.config/git-annex/program` file. Either the file is missing, or it points to the wrong location for the git-annex command. All that --autostart does is run the program listed on that file in each repository listed in the autostart file. Note that you don't need the file when git-annex is installed in your PATH.

So, how did you install git-annex?
