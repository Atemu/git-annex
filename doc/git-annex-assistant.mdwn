# OPTIONS

  in the file `~/.config/git-annex/autostart`

  This is typically started at boot, or when you log in.

* `--startdelay=N`

  Wait N seconds before running the startup scan. This process can
  be expensive and you may not want to run it immediately upon login.

* `--foreground`

  Avoid forking to the background.

* `--stop`

  Stop a running daemon in the current repository.
