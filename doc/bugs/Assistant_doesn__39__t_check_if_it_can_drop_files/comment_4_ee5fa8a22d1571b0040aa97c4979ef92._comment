Actually, I'm still a little confused.

If git-annex was presuming I wanted to keep all the files as you say, why were they listed in `git annex find --want-drop` and dropped by `git annex drop --auto`?

Shouldn't they have been empty and a no-op respectively?

There seems to be a difference in the behaviour between the command line (wanting to and actually dropping the files) and the assistant (wanting to keep them) for the same settings.
