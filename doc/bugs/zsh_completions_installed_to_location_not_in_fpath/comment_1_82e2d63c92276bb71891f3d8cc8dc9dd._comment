Debian also supports /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/,
it's just that it's for local sysadmin use and not a place that
packages should install files, so they added /usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/
for that.

However, checking `/etc/os_release` probably entails keeping track of the
name of every debian derivative, so I'd really rather not do that.

Also, even if the Makefile were changed to use
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/, it sounds as if that might not be a
path that works universally either.

Surely there must be a way to ask zsh where to install completions to?
But short of taking the first item from $fpath, which doesn't seem robust,
I don't know how to. And zsh may not even be installed when building a
package that should later integrate with zsh.

FWIW, I checked half a dozen packages like curl that include zsh
completions, and none of them installed them with `make install`,
they were just there to be installed manually. It seems zsh is making this
too hard for software to bother integrating with it.
