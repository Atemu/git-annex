So this sounds like [[bugs/direct_mode_assistant_in_subdir_confusion]], which was fixed in 4.20131024. Is there a possibility that you started the git-annex assistant (or webapp) from within `incoming/5d` ?

I'm not sure if the bug could also cause the removal of directories to happen in the wrong location.

It should be possible to revert these changes and get your files back.

1. `git annex indirect`
2. `git log --stat` (find the commit that deleted files)
3. `git revert $commit`
4. `git annex direct`
