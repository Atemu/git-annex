For most files, whether they get annexed is controlled by `annex.largefiles`.  But dotfiles are configured to *never* be annexed regardless of `annex.largefiles`.  This is unexpected and confusing.  More oddly, `git-annex-add` doesn't seem to add them to regular git, either.

I'm guessing this flows from the new default of `git add` adding files to the annex, which [[I hope gets reversed|forum/lets_discuss_git_add_behavior]].  But separately, I'm not sure why `git-annex-add` does not add the dotfiles to regular git:
