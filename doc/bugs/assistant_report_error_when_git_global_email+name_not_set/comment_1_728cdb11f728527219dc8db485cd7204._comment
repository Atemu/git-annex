You didn't say what version of git-annex you're using.

Different versions of git-annex have gone to increasing lengths to work
around this problem of git not working out of the box on systems like
yours. Without a version number, or other infortmation, I have no way
of knowing why it didn't work.

Since the current version's workarounds include noticing if commit fails,
and coniguring the user.name and user.email, I'll bet you're using some
old version..
