Ok, that verifies my hypothesis that fsck is outputting a lot of lines. 369082 lines to be precise, comprising 20 mb of data in all. So it's not too surprising this ends up blowing up into a bad amount of memory use. 

I'm going to move this from a forum post over to a bug: <http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/enormous_fsck_output_OOM>
