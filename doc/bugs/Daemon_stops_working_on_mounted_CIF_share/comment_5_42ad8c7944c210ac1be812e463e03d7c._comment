My point is that if the filesystem is rejecting all attempts to access it with \"permission denied\", it's hardly surprising that git-annex doesn't work, since nothing works. If running the assistant somehow causes the filesystem to get into this strange broken state, then you have a nice repoducible bug to report on the filesystem, I suppose. I don't see how it could be a bug in git-annex, since it is using only standard posix filesystem system calls, plus inotify.

Based on this, samba/CIFS does not support inotify: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8124617/getting-file-create-notifications-for-cifs-mount-in-linux>
Thus, the assistant won't work on it.

If I were you, I'd set up git-annex repositories on local filesystems, and let it take care of the syncronosation, rather than using a networked filesystem.
