Just tried torrents backend -- it works -- THANKS!!!
But amount of output dumped upon user is somewhat outstanding (I can't even scroll terminal back far enough for 1 file fetch).  May be for such backends, where no easy/reasonable way to estimate progress it would be possible at least to have some spinning wheel animation which would react (spin) to any output received from the corresponding downloader/backend?  (unless in debug mode in which normal output probably should be shown as well)
