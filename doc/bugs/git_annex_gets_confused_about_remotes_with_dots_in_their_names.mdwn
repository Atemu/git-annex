For test.com//test, I get this:

    % git annex copy . --to test.com//test
    (getting UUID for test...) git-annex: there is no git remote named "test.com//test"

And my .git/config changes from

    [remote "test.com//test"]
    	url = richih@test.com:/test
    	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/test.com//test/*

to

    [remote "test.com//test"]
    	url = richih@test.com:/test
    	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/test.com//test/*
    	annex-uuid = xyz
    [remote "test"]
    	annex-uuid = xyz


Unless I am misunderstanding something, git annex gets confused about what the name of the remote it supposed to be, truncates at the dot for some operations and uses the full name for others.
