By file history, I mean old versions of a file. So, if I do something like this:

touch file.txt
sleep 5
echo -n \"1\" > file.txt
sleep 5
echo -n \"2\" >> file.txt

How do I find copies of the initial and 2nd version (with only \"1\n\") of file.txt?

Diffs could be done (if meaningful) via command line pipes or whatever.
