Guys talking about uname -o and stuff, this is not the place to do that.
File a [[bug]] report if you have a bug like that. You're making it harder
for every person who opens this page to install git-annex and ends up
wwading through discussion of fixed bugs like that one. Also, I respond
*much* faster to bug reports than to random misplaced comments about bugs.
