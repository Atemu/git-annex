Per-remote state is an added complication. A sameas remote should not
use the same per-remote state, because what's stored in it is up to the
remote backend and would conflict.

So Logs.RemoteState would need to use something other than a UUID,
which contains the underlying uuid of the sameas remote. (Logs.MetaData too for
per-remote metadata.) That would have to be passed in when constructing the
remote.

And, `git-annex forget` would need to be made to remote the per-remote state of
sameas remotes that point to a dead uuid.
