Hmm, other git-annex man pages don't show use of -- before eg,
filenames, which seem more likely to need it than any value a config could
be set to. Highly unlikely something like annex.youtube-dl-options would
ever be supported here, as it would invite security holes. So I'm inclined
to feel mentioning the -- on the man page is clutter, the same way
it's eg not mentioned on the man page for `ls`. Although I suppose that
does raise the question of how anyone ever learns about -- .. I forget how
I did.

Anyway, yes, the current implementation is really --set=value, and due to
that implementation detail, -- can't come before the the value.
