Seems that 5.20151208 (I tried it) attempts to get content from the remote
specified with --from even though the git-annex branch's location log 
doesn't say the remote contains that content. It stats the expected
location on the remote, notices there's a file there, and ignores the
location log.

That was changed in [[!commit cd1676d6048ff7307518df94ea22a23e711be29d]],
and the change had a good reason motivating it. It would be possible to add
back a check of Remote.hasKeyCheap when the location log doesn't think it
has a copy, but that would make every copy from a directory remote slower
to handle this edge case and I don't think that's warranted.

As noted, annex-speculate-present does work if you really need that for
some reason.
