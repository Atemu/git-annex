Hmm, is this an encrypted rsync remote? 

I have not been able to reproduce the problem so fat.

If you start the assistant with --debug, and look in .git/annex/daemon.log, you should find where it runs gpg, and the lines showing what it's doing just before/after that should provide a hint what it's doing.
