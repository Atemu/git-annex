I have a large USB hard disk where I store all my projects and a computer with a rather small SSD.
The SSD holds only projects that are active, they are my "working copy". 
Whenever I connect the USB drive to the computer, I want it to be updated from the SSD.

What would be the best possible setup for that? Is it possible at all? How would I tag certain projects as active?
