I absolutely agree that the -m should stop git from requiring a commit message.  I don't know if anything has changed in a newer version, but that's what I'm seeing.

I'm using the git-annex-bin package from the AUR so it's already the standalone binary: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex-bin/

As you can see by the PKGBUILD, it just copies the git-annex binary to /usr/bin/git-annex and creates a symlink for git-annex-shell.
