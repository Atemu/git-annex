HongoDB doesn't build with current hackage.

keyvaluehash passed some inital load etc tests. The inability to delete old keys/values might not be a significant problem.

However I don't think it has any ACID guarantees; eg a crash at the wrong time could leave the database in some inconsistent state. <https://github.com/Peaker/keyvaluehash/issues/1>
