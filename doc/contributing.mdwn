## Style

This project uses tabs for indentation and the code looks fine with
any tab width. If you are using Emacs, and have it configured to use
spaces for indentation, then you can add a `./.dir-locals.el` to use
tabs for files in this project. See
<http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DirectoryVariables>.
