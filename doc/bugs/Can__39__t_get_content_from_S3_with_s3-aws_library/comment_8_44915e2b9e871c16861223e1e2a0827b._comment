Glad that resolved it, but I'm still confused why I can't seem to get the
test file when I have my test program use ap-southeast-2. (But maybe those
creds you gave me just don't let me or something..)

If you're up for some sleuthing, you could check out the git-annex branch
and look through `git blame remotes.log`. And changes that git-annex ever
made to the config of the remote will be in the history of that file.
