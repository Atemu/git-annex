git-annex 7.20191218 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * git-lfs: The url provided to initremote/enableremote will now be
     stored in the git-annex branch, allowing enableremote to be used without
     an url. initremote --sameas can be used to add additional urls.
   * git-lfs: When there's a git remote with an url that's known to be
     used for git-lfs, automatically enable the special remote.
   * sync, assistant: Pull and push from git-lfs remotes.
   * Fix bug that made bare repos be treated as non-bare when --git-dir
     was used.
   * inprogress: Support --key.
   * Sped up many git-annex commands that operate on many files, by
     avoiding reserialization of keys.
     find is 7% faster; whereis is 3% faster; and git-annex get when
     all files are already present is 5% faster
   * Stop displaying rsync progress, and use git-annex's own progress display
     for local-to-local repo transfers.
   * benchmark: Changed --databases to take a parameter specifiying the size
     of the database to benchmark.
   * benchmark --databases: Display size of the populated database.
   * benchmark --databases: Improve the "addAssociatedFile (new)"
     benchmark to really add new values, not overwriting old values.
   * Windows: Fix handling of changes to time zone. (Used to work but was
     broken in version 7.20181031.)"""]]
