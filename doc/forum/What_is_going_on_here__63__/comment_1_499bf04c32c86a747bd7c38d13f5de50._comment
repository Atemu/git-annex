From a quick glance, you don't sync the `git-annex` branch (which tracks the location of files) across the two repos, so the 2nd repo doesn't know that the file is in the `shared-storage` remote. I suspect that `git annex get` silently skips the file, see this excerpt from the [[git-annex-get]] manpage:
>* `--from=remote`
>
>  Normally git-annex will choose which remotes to get the content
>  from, preferring remotes with lower costs. Use this option to specify
>  which remote to use. 
>  
>  **Any files that are not available on the remote will be silently skipped.**

If you don't pass the `--from=` option, it will probably complain that the there are no known copies of the file instead. <br>
Instead, I suggest you to keep the `git-annex` branch in sync with `git annex sync --only-annex`. It can also directly get/copy the files if you pass the `--content` option.
