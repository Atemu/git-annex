I have successfully built git-annex using plain cabal on OpenBSD, and ran into significant problems using stack.

The main thing was that I needed to add a lot of swap space, and the build took forever. Running out of memory pretty much just killed the machine. I would love to have an official build available. Would make my life easier too, and put the effort in one place.
