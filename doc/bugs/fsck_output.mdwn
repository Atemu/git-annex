When you check several files and the fsck fails, you get confusing output:

<pre>
fsck test1 (checksum...) 
  Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies of test1 exist.
  Back it up with git-annex copy.

failed
fsck test2 (checksum...) 
  Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies of test2 exist.
  Back it up with git-annex copy.

failed
</pre>

The newline is in the wrong place and confuses the user. It should be printed _after_ "failed".
