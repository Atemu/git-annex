How much data do you have stored in git-annex?

The way to get this value is to run `git annex status` (or `git annex info`
if you have git-annex version 5 already), and look for the line
that says "size of annexed files in working tree" or "known annex size".

If you've got multiple repositories that each contain different files
(not git clones), you can run it in each and add them up.
