# NAME

git-annex export - export content to a remote

# SYNOPSIS

git annex export `treeish --to remote`

# DESCRIPTION

Use this command to export a tree of files from a git-annex repository.

Normally files are stored on a git-annex special remote named by their
keys. That is great for data storage, but your filenames are obscured.
Exporting replicates the tree to the special remote as-is.

Mixing key/value and exports in the same remote would be a mess and so is
not allowed. So, you have to configure a remote with `exporttree=true`
when initially setting it up with [[git-annex-initremote]](1).

Repeated exports are done efficiently, by diffing the old and new tree,
and transferring only the changed files.

Exports can be interrupted and resumed. However, partially uploaded files
will be re-started from the beginning.
