A conflict during sync or merge is something that requires user intervention, or at least notification. For that reason it would be nice if git annex returned a nonzero exit status when such a conflict happened during a sync or a merge. This is what git does after a conflicting pull, and would make it easier to spot a conflict in automated syncs without having to parse annex output or the logs.

Also, it would be nice if your new `git annex status` were able to inform about remaining conflicts in the repo, for instance by reporting files with variant-XXX suffix.
