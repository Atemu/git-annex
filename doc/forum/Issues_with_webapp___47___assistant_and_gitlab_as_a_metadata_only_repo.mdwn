Greetings,

Two more issues have come up.  

1) webapp (and assistant) don't always seem to inherit ssh-agent keys (I've setup a passwordless key for gitlab).  It usually takes multiple cycles of killing off ssh and annex-related daemons before a new instance will not fail auth with gitlab - is there a more solid way of doing this?

2) When I do get auth, the assistant / webui will notice file changes (i.e moving a small file that doesn't match annex.largefiles, but the changes don't get committed to origin (gitlab - metadata only).  The log file is below - thougts?
