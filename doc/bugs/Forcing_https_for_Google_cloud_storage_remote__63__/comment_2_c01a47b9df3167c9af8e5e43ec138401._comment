You need to upgrade to git-annex 5.20141203. With that version, 
you can pass port=443 to git-annex initremote and it will then use
https.

The old version you're using does not support this.

Also, AFAIK, S3 does not send passwords over the wire; it uses a
challange-response, which proves to the S3 server that you possess the
access keys. This would not be susceptable to attackers in the way you
think it is.
