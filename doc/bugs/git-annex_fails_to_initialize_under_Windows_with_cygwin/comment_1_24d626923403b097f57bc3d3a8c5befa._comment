This looks similar to [[bugs/git-annex_fails_to_initialize_under_Windows]], which was solved by upgrading to a newer version of msysgit.

git 1.7.9 is extremely old (years). Probably the empty commit that is done when switching to direct mode, precisely to avoid this problem, fails, because the pre-built git-annex for windows is targeting a modern version of git, from msysgit.
