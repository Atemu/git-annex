Yes, I run the assistant in the background. The error came up after I ran 

    git init
    git annex init
    git annex direct
    git annex assistant

in a directory containing a lot of files (around 80G). Right away, `git annex status` gave me the error below. The file name in question never changed during the process of adding files and hasn't changed after all files have been added.

Here's the complete command line output:

    $ git annex status
