It's quite easy to implement an [external special remote](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/external/) that does transparent compression. You can use the example implementations of the directory remote as a starting point (see [Bash](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/external/example.sh/) or [Python](https://github.com/Lykos153/AnnexRemote/blob/master/examples/git-annex-remote-directory)). Then just modify the dostore() and doretrieve() functions to your liking. You probably don't want to support exporting when compression is enabled, though.
