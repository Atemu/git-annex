Followed the instructions over here: http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/git-annex_on_OSX/

and had to install the following extra packages to be able to get make to start:

[realizes pcre-light is needed but pcre not installed on my mac]  
sudo port install pcre  
sudo cabal install pcre-light

But then I got the following error:  

<pre>
ghc -O2 -Wall --make git-annex  
[ 7 of 52] Compiling BackendTypes     ( BackendTypes.hs, BackendTypes.o

My knowledge of Haskell (had to lookup the spelling...) is more than rudimentary so any help would be appreciated.

Closing this bug because the above problem now has a solution documented on
the install page, and the below test suite failure problems should all be
resolved on OSX. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
