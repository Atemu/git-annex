The way git-annex uses the '%f' file, the smudge filter does
not actually write to it, so that's fine. The clean filter
does directly access the file, but this would only be a problem if git ran
the clean filter with stdin not matching the file. As far as I know git never
does, because the clean filter is only used by `git add` (or `commit -a`).

However, the lack of clarity regarding when it's safe to really access
'%f' is indeed a problem with git's interface; git-annex has to very
carefully work around git's current, not fully specified behavior.
