cwebber sent me a test case, and it turns out that while his problem was different, I fixed it in the same commit I fixed the problem described in the comment above. Both problems involved cases where the object storage directory was left with frozen permissions, and they needed to be unlocked before moving files in/out of it.

Also, it seems that blender did not misbehave as thought. It only replaces the git-annex symlink with a new .blend file. Which is fine.

Finally, there was an unrelated bug in `git annex direct` that chris's test case repo happened to have, which caused it to not convert 2 files to direct mode. I've fixed that bug as well.
