This is not the kind of problem that `git-annex repair` can fix.
The problems it fixes are all where one clone of a repo has gotten some
object files corrupted by eg disk problems, but other clones still have
good copies of those object files.

The reason `git-annex repair` reports it failed is because it sees that
`git fsck` is reporting a problem and the things it's tried to do didn't
fix it.

Are the "missing files" missing in that their annexed content is not
present, or missing in that there is no annex symlink at all? In the former
case, you need `git annex fsck` on those files, or `git-annex get`. In the
latter case, if `git status` doesn't show a missing file as deleted, that
would be a very strange problem with git.
