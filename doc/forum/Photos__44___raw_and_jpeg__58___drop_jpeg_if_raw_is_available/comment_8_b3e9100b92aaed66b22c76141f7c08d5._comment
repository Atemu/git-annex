Hm, the raw converter reads and writes metadata from the “sidecar” xmp files, so it would not work to have it only in git-annex. Therefore, a full sync would be required, but luckily this is one-directional, so it should be possible. I think that's the way to go for me.

Thanks for your effort helping me with my stupid questions :).

And disk space is my main concern here, as mentioned above. I really need solutions since I did not know where to put new images, which unfortunately coincided with the birth of my 2nd child and I caught myself taking less photographs of her because I did not know where to put them (and having them accessible from the photo management/raw converter). Therefore, I decided to finally seriously try git-annex which I watch almost from the beginning of the project.

Thanks again :)
