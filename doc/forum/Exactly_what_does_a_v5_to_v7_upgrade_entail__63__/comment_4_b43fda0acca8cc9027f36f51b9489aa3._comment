Just for completeness, here's what upgrading a direct mode repository to v7
entails:

* everything listed above
* annex.thin is set to true
* .git/annex/objects gets populated, since direct mode didn't populate
  it and in v7 annexed objects always get stored there.
  This involves hard linking annexed files in the work tree
  into the objects directory. If the filesystem doesn't support
  hard links, it unfortunately has to copy the files, which will
  double the disk space used by the repository.
  (There's a todo item discussing maybe clawing that space back,
  but it seems to need changes to git to do.)
* An adjusted unlocked branch is created from the current branch,
  and checked out.
  Essentially the same as running `git annex adjust --unlock`
