On 10abf964f (add new deps, 2020-06-30), `stack build` fails for me
with

```
/home/kyle/src/haskell/git-annex/git-lfs 1.1.0/: getDirectoryContents:openDirStream: does not exist (No such file or directory)
```

I think this is due to a hyphen missing before the version.  I've
added those locally to stack.yaml (assuming that's correct,
stack-lts-12.14.yaml should of course get the same update).

After doing that, it looks like there is a dependency mismatch that
can't be resolved:

```
Error: While constructing the build plan, the following exceptions were encountered:

In the dependencies for http-client-restricted-0.0.2:
    http-client-0.6.4 from stack configuration does not match >=0.5 && <0.6  (latest matching version
                      is 0.5.14)
needed due to git-annex-8.20200617 -> http-client-restricted-0.0.2

Some different approaches to resolving this:

  * Set 'allow-newer: true'
    in /home/kyle/.stack/config.yaml to ignore all version constraints and build anyway.

  * Recommended action: try adding the following to your extra-deps
    in /home/kyle/src/haskell/git-annex/stack.yaml:

- http-client-0.5.14@sha256:4880b27d6741e331454a1d4c887d96ce3d7d625322c8433983a4b1cd08538577,5348

Plan construction failed.
```

Here's my stack version, which is running on top of Debian Buster:

```
$ stack --version
Version 2.3.1, Git revision de2a7b694f07de7e6cf17f8c92338c16286b2878 (8103 commits) x86_64 hpack-0.33.0
```

Locally, I've set `httpclientrestricted` and `gitlfs` flags to false
to use the vendored version for now.
