I just created a new remote on a USB drive and wanted to copy my files over. git-annex wasn't too happy about that ;)
I included a few OK transfers as there was an error before git-annex ran into a wall. As I could easily access that temp file after it aborted, I suspect something went wrong internally before git-annex started to throw those errors.

Please note the "_n TIMES_" comments. It's how often I got the same error message...
