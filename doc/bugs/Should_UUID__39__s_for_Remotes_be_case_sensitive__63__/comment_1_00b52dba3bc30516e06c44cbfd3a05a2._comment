There does not seem to be an actual bug description in here. Can you provide more info?

To answer the actual question: RFC 4122 clearly answers no:

      Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a
      zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant
      digit first.  The hexadecimal values \"a\" through \"f\" are output as
      lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.

Yes, that means that git-annex prints them wrongly as that's upper case.
