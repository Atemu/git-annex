2. \"Of a file, to be able to revert it to an older version of that file's content\" -- if you create a branch off the commit with that file version,  and check out that branch, this will check out the file pointer to the older contents version.  You may need to then [[`git-annex-get`|git-annex-get]] that old content if it has been moved somewhere.
3. \"Of a file, to get visibility into what versions of that file's content are available on what remotes\" -- see [[`git-annex-log`|git-annex-log]]
