Hi, 

I have a laptop and desktop pc.
I initialized git-annex repo on laptop and mounted laptop to desktop.
I added mounted laptop directory to desktop as a remote.
After I synced files with content with laptop on desktop.
I want to get files and commits on laptop but I can't.

On laptop there is a .git directory but I don't know how to get files from it.
