Use `SETURLPRESENT` when it's a regular http url. This allows
git-annex to download from the remote in readonly mode without needing the
external special remote program to be installed at all.

Use `SETURIPRESENT` for things that are not http urls, but that it makes
sense for `git annex whereis` to display.
