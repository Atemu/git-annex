git-annex 3.20110928 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * --in can be used to make git-annex only operate on files
     believed to be present in a given repository.
   * Arbitrarily complex expressions can be built to limit the files git-annex
     operates on, by combining the options --not --and --or -( and -)
     Example: git annex get --exclude '*.mp3' --and --not -( --in usbdrive --or --in archive -)
   * --copies=N can be used to make git-annex only operate on files with
     the specified number of copies. (And --not --copies=N for the inverse.)
   * find: Rather than only showing files whose contents are present,
     when used with --exclude --copies or --in, displays all files that
     match the specified conditions.
   * Note that this is a behavior change for git-annex find! Old behavior
     can be gotten by using: git-annex find --in .
   * status: Massively sped up; remove --fast mode.
   * unused: File contents used by branches and tags are no longer
     considered unused, even when not used by the current branch. This is
     the final piece of the puzzle needed for git-annex to to play nicely
     with branches."""]]
