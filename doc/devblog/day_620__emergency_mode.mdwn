I'm only working on git-annex a day or two a week at present. Like
everyone, dealing with the covid-19 crisis taking up a lot of my time.
Some days I can't concentrate, some days I am dealing with basic needs,
and other days I am rushing to develop other software targeted at this crisis.
(See my [personal blog](https://joeyh.name/blog/).)

I remotely attended the
[MONII](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/channels/event/virtual-web-based-making-open-neuroscience-infrastructures-interoperable-30-303671)
conference a week ago, with lots of researchers doing things with software
related to git-annex, some in the health field, and something that struck
me was a mention that it's important that scientists continue their work,
even if it's not directly related to the crisis. All kinds of fields are
going to be important in the time ahead beyond saving lives.

So I am prioritizing anything scientists need to use git-annex, and
anything those working on the crisis might need. If that's you and you need
something, you can use the new "priority" tag on bugs and todos, and it
will go right to the top of the [[design/roadmap]]. Do bear in mind that I
have limited time/resources/attention right now, so only use it when you
really need something urgently.
