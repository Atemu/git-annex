I noticed that `git annex drop` of an unlocked file causes the next `git
status` to re-smudge the file. That's surprising because git-annex
internally updates the index using git update-index, so git should not see
any need to revisit it.

So my guess is you were getting or dropping a lot of unlocked files when
you saw that.
