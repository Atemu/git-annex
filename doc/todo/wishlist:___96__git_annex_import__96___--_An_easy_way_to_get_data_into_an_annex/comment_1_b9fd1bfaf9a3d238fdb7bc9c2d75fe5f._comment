This is such a good idea that I went into the time machine and arranged for it to be implemented in June 2012:

<pre>
       import [path ...]
              Moves files from somewhere outside the git work‐
              ing copy, and adds them to the annex. Individual
              files to import can be specified.  If  a  direc‐
              tory is specified, all files in it are imported,
              and any subdirectory structure inside it is pre‐
              served.

               git annex import /media/camera/DCIM/
</pre>

I don't see much use for `--copy-only` though. so did not implement it them (also I needed to spend some of my time at the race track). It seems to me that using `--copy-only` as you describe it would do everything except for add the files to git. You can get the same behavior by using `git annex import`, which only stages the new files but does not commit them, and then moving files around and running `git annex add` on them, followed by committing.
