Great. We can see git-annex opens the XMPP stream tag, and your server responds by opening its own tag.

Compare with this similar conversation:

    joey@gnu:~>telnet kite 5222
    Trying 80.68.85.49...
    Connected to wren.kitenet.net.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    <?xml version='1.0'?>
    <stream:stream xmlns=\"jabber:client\" to=\"kitenet.net\" version=\"1.0\"   xmlns:stream=\"http://etherx.jabber.org/streams\">
    <?xml version='1.0'?><stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'   id='e7d73883-a362-4923-89f8-0531eb9d16a0' from='kitenet.net' version='1.0' xml:lang='en'><stream:features>   

So far it's the same as the conversation with your server, but now my server goes on to send another line:

    <stream:features><starttls xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls'/><mechanisms xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'>  <mechanism>SCRAM-SHA-1</mechanism><mechanism>DIGEST-MD5</mechanism></mechanisms></stream:features>

While your server does not send anything. 

I see that my XMPP client library expects to receive a features tag at this point. Until it does, it won't continue. It may be that your server is not sending the features because it does not implement TLS or any of the other features that need to be advertised.

I think I need to report this to the author of the XMPP client library. It would help to know what XMPP server software you're using, and if it has TLS support enabled.
