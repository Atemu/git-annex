There are still use cases for read-only unlock of just some files.  One issue with symlinks is that Docker doesn't follow them.  So if I want to let Dockerized code read annexed files, I have to unlock them first.  But, if these files are to be only used as input, unlocking them for modification is not really what I want to do.  I don't want `git status` to list these files as modified.
