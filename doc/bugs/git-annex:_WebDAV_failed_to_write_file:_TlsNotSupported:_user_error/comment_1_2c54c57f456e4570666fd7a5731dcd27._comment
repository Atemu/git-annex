Tested this with the Debian build and it works ok.

TlsNotSupported is a new exception thrown by http-client, which is a very new library. Using an older version of http-conduit should avoid whatever the bug is.
Probably something to do with http-conduit not using http-client-tls, so http-client is left with no way to handle TLS connections.
