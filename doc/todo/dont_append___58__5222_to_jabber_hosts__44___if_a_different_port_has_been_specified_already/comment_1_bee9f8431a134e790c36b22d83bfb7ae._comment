Well, the weppapp prompts for a XMPP address, which AFAIK does not include
a port.

`.git/annex/creds/xmpp` can contain a port, but that's only used when
the SRV record lookup doesn't find anything. Since most XMPP servers
have SRV records, and SRV includes a port.

AFAICS, if the SRV record includes a nonstandard port, it will be used. 
If there's no SRV record, port 5222 will be used, unless you edit
`.git/annex/creds/xmpp` to use another port, and then what you specified
will be used.
