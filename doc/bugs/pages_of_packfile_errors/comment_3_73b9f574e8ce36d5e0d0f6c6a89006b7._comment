Well, if there's a bug here, it might be that this particular problem has caused the repair process to loop repeatedly trying to unpack a pack file. 
I don't see how that could happen, looking at the code it will try to unpack each pack file only once.

If you run `git annex repair --debug`, you can see the git commands it runs, and so see if it's somehow looping. When I do this with some corrupt pack files (actually, I swapped one pack file for another one), I see, for example:

<pre>
[2014-02-24 19:11:42 JEST] feed: git [\"--git-dir=/home/joey/tmp/git/.git\",\"--work-tree=/home/joey/tmp/git\",\"unpack-objects\",\"-r\"]

...
</pre>

Which shows that git-annex only ran `git unpack-objects -r` once, and yet it printed out the same error repeatedly.

One possibility is a problem using `-r`, which makes it keep going on errors. Which seemed like a good idea at the time to unpack as much as possible from a damaged file. It might be that `git unpack-objects` is itself getting stuck in some kind of loop with the -r.

In my case, it did not get stuck; it eventually quit and it moved on to the next pack file, after 900-some repitions of the error message:

<pre>
[2014-02-24 19:16:47 JEST] feed: git [\"--git-dir=/home/joey/tmp/git/.git\",\"--work-tree=/home/joey/tmp/git\",\"unpack-objects\",\"-r\"]

</pre>

Intesting that it's again complaining about the same pack file, despite having moved from one pack file on to the next one. I think what's going on here is while unpacking pack files A..Y (which may all be fine), it's checking pack file Z, which is corrupt, to see if the objects exist in it, and complaining each time.

So, I can improve this a lot by moving *all* the pack files out of the way before trying to unpack any of them. In my test case, that completely eliminated the errors, and probably also sped it up a bit.

If I were you, I'd either try stopping your running git-annex and run `git annex repair --debug` and analize the log like I did above, or get the next daily build which has that change, and see if it helps in your case.
