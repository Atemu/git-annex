Looking back at the original bug description:

\"repo A a symlink to a file whose contents aren't yet available, are overwritten, while at repo B the file is deleted.\"

I think the \"overwritten\" is key. I suspect you were always doing echo > f where f was a symlink, and this does not actually overwrite the symlink, it just puts data (that fsck will reject) into the annex.

So, proceeding as if the real bug here is the ability to write through symlink in direct mode, unless told otherwise..
