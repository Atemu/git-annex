There is a difference between a WHEREIS that for some reason itself hit the
network, and a single network connection in PREPARE. The language was
really talking about the former, which would make whereis on a large number
of files painful. Not saying it wouldn't be better to avoid the latter too;
if the user is only running whereis on 1 file the overhead is equally as bad.

Hmm, there is that "long running network connections" section
that encourages using PREPARE that way, I think the idea was to make it as
simple as possible to implement an external remote. All of git-annex's
built-in remotes defer anything like that until it's needed.

In a way the real problem here is that WHEREIS is something most
remotes will never need to implement, but it's queried of all of them.
If only the few remotes that implement it needed to avoid network
connections in PREPARE, that would not be much trouble to do.

PREPARE-LOCAL would need to be a protocol extension, so special remotes
would have to be modified to request it, and those that are not modified
would still have the overhead. Would that be any more likely to
happen/easier to do than modifying all special remotes to defer network
connections until needed?
