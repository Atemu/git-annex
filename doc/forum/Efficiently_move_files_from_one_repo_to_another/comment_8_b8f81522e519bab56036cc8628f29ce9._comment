Ilya_Shlyakhter, thanks for the link. Apparently \"git-annex get\" also works on bare repos (but I still have to find out how to use this with gitolite, maybe I can write some custom hook or something..)

About the refspecs etc. I think my git-knowledge is not sufficient to fully grasp your idea. But there's one thing that makes me hesitate. I'm looking for a solution that is as less \"special\" as possible. If I have to remember what I was thinking when I designed all this, I'm pretty sure things will break eventually. Thus, in a good solution all thinks should work identically as with regular git-annex. If I have to remember something to do things (e.g. move operations) more efficiently that's okay, as long as things don't break when I just use my repo like a regular git-annex repo. I'm not sure if your approach would provide this.

Also, I suppose I would have to \"design\" one mega-repository for all my current (and probably future) use cases. A loose coupling of otherwise separated repos seems not to be possible, as far as I understand the solution. This could especially become an issue for repos I want to share with others.
