### Please describe the problem.

The git-annex annex repo at <https://downloads.kitenet.net/.git/> is not available. This is the address mentioned at <http://git-annex.branchable.com/publicrepos/>.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    $ git clone https://downloads.kitenet.net/.git/
    Cloning into 'downloads.kitenet.net'...
    fatal: repository 'https://downloads.kitenet.net/.git/' not found

### Please provide any additional information below.

Have tried various combinations of the URL, but nothing works. It was like this a week ago too, but I didn't report it because I thought it was a temporary error due to some server reconfiguration or something.
