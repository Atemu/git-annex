- I have successfully cross-built (well -- it produced binaries, didn't test if they are usable) built `file` using/as shown in https://github.com/nscaife/file-windows/pull/9
- There is https://github.com/julian-r/file-windows with a visual studio built `file`.  releases provide builds using difference VS versions, not sure if it needs any VS runtime
- In conda apparently there is already `m2-file` package (a bit dated from 3 years ago) 

so may be one of those ways could assist in establishing a built with MAGIC support on windows?
