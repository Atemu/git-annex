### Please describe the problem.

Creating a SSH remote git-annex repository using the assisstant gives transcript:

Initialized empty shared Git repository in /home/flindner/annex2/
exec: 76: git-annex: Argument list too long

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Using assistent: Creating a new empty local repository. Next, add another remote server repository using SSH. Checking the server went fine. I choose creating git repository. After about 5 minutes the error message above appears. In that time on the server runshell and git take plenty of CPU power but almost no memory. The directory on the server is created, but pairing was not successfull.

Local: git-annex-standalone 4.20130909-1 from Archlinux AUR
Remote: git-annex-standalone-i386.tar.gz as of 13. sept. 13. on Debian Squeeze.
