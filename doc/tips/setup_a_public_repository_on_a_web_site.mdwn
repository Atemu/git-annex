Let's say you want to distribute some big files to the whole world.
You can of course, just drop them onto a website. But perhaps you'd like to
use git-annex to manage those files. And as an added bonus, why not let
anyone in the world clone your site and use `git-annex get`!

My site like this is [downloads.kitenet.net](https://downloads.kitenet.net).
Here's how I set it up. --[[Joey]]

1. Set up a web site. I used Apache, and configured it to follow symlinks.
   `Options FollowSymLinks`
2. Put some files on the website. Make sure it works.
4. `git init; git annex init`
3. We want users to be able to clone the git repository over http, because
   git-annex can download files from it over http as well. For this to
   work, `git update-server-info` needs to get run after commits. The
   git `post-update` hook will take care of this, you just need to enable
   the hook. `chmod +x .git/hooks/post-update`
5. `git annex add; git commit -m added`
6. Make sure users can still download files from the site directly.
7. Instruct advanced users to clone a http url that ends with the "/.git/"
   directory. For example, for downloads.kitenet.net, the clone url
   is `https://downloads.kitenet.net/.git/`
8. Set up a git `post-receive` hook that runs `git annex merge`, and
   the repository's working tree will automatically be updated when
   you run `git annex sync` in a clone that can push to the repository.  
   (Needs git-annex version 4.20130703 or newer; older versions
   can use `git annex sync` in the post-receive hook instead.)

When users clone over http, and run git-annex, it will
automatically learn all about your repository and be able to download files
right out of it, also using http.
