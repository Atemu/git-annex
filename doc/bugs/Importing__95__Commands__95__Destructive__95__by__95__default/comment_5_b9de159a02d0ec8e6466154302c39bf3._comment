I was also confused the first time I read the documentation of `git-annex-import`. By default it *moves* files, IE copies files into your annex and then deletes them from the source. Since `git-annex` commands seems to be eager to preserve multiple copies of files I did find it surprising that with this command it does not. I suppose one motivation for deleting the files at the source is so `git-annex` or the user can keep track of which files have been imported, IE they are using the import command to put unorganized files under the control of an annex.

I would have expected `git-annex import` to *copy* files by default, then have an option like `--move` to *move* files instead. I'm not sure this is a compelling enough reason to change an existing command thoughâ€¦

Personally I always do `git-annex import --duplicate`
