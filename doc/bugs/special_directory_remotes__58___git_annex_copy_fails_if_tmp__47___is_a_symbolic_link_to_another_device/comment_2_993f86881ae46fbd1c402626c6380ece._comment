The directory special remote writes to a directory under the "tmp"
directory, and then it renames that into place. Amoung other things that
makes the update happen atomically. If "tmp" is on another filesystem than
the final destination, a rename won't work.

I just don't see any point in making this be supported, because if it were,
git-annex would have to first write to the "tmp" directory, and then
re-write the same files all over again to the final destination. So making
the tmp directory be on a faster device can't actually speed anything up.
It would just make it slower.
