What do you think of the following simpler variant:
    % git annex size myfile1.zip
    myfile1.zip is 1329 MB
    % git annex size mydir/
    mydir contains 2803 files totaling 328 GB.

It may be a good idea to store the size of a subtree along with the other metadata. It's not a big overhead and you'd avoid the double run.
