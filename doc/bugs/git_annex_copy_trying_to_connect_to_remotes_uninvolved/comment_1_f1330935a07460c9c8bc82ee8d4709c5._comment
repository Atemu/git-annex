git-annex needs to discover the uuid of each remote before it can use it. So it currently goes off the discover these uuids at startup time.

If you have a remote that you do not want git-annex to use, you can set remote.name.annex-ignore and it will not do this discovery process for that remote.

While it would be possible to defer the lookup until an operation that needs to know the remote's uuid, it would complicate the code quite a bit, so I have not tried to do so.
