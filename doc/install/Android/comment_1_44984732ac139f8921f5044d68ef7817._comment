Git-annex repositories consist of symlinks that are checked into git, and in turn point at the content of large files that are stored in .git/annex/objects/. 
Direct mode gets rid of the symlinks. The advantage of direct mode is that you can access files directly, including modifying them.
Enjoyed reading the article above, really explains steps to install git-annex in detail, the article is very interesting and effective.
I learn new information from your article. Thank you for this post.
