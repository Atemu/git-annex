### Please describe the problem.
Attempting to populate one annex from another over an SSH connection is very slow.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create an annex on Linux
2. Clone annex to Windows system
3. Set up sshd on Linux system, access keys, etc.
4. "git annex get ."
5. Checking if an individual file exists takes a few seconds, and downloading it takes a few seconds. on a 100Mbps LAN, transfers at an average of 7Mbps.
6. By comparison operating over a working HTTP connection transfers between 20~40 Mbps.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Windows 7: 4.20140627-g8a36ec5 (from the git-annex download page)

Debian Linux: 3.20120629 (from the package manager)
