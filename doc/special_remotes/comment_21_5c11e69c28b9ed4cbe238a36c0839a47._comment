@Bence the closest I have is some tests of particular special remotes inside Test.hs. The shell equivilant of that code is:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
set -e
git annex copy file --to remote # tests store
git annex drop file # tests checkpresent when remote has file
git annex move file --from remote # tests retrieve and remove
\"\"\"]]
"""]]
