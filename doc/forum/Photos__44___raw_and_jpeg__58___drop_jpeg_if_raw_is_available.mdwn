I try to use git-annex to manage my photographs. With most cameras, I do shoot raw+jpeg, but sometimes or from some sources there are only jpegs. Is there a possibility to automatically detect the raw+jpeg pairs (same basename, in the same directory, matching raw+jpeg extensions, would be the rule) and drop these jpegs from my notebooks repository, but keep the jpegs that do not have a complementing raw?
