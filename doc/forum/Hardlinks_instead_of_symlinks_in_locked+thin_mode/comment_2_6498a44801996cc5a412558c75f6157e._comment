Well, it does have the benefits of locked mode, but does it really have
additional benefits like direct mode did? 

Locked mode also does not involve duplication of files so that's kind of
irrelevant.

The actual benefit of direct mode was well, you could directly modify
files, in place. This mode would not have that benefit. annex.thin
also allows direct modification in place.

The only advantage that the old direct mode had, over the
current `git config annex.thin true; git-annex adjust --unlock`, is that
direct mode managed to not store two copies of content even on a filesystem
that does not support hard links. But this new mode relies on hard links.

I do sort of like this idea, but I'm struggling to articulate why at the
moment, and so unsure how I'd even begin to document it. Any help
appreciated. :)
