### Please describe the problem.

Hi,  all excited that the new release fixes the unknown UUID issue in the Webapp I hurridly installed the latest versions.  

Some progress in that the webapp now reports my missing/non-existent repo as an "unfinished repository" in the process of being setup.  I see a check status box that when clicked says "in progress please be patient".  Also I see the ssh config has changed to use IdentitiesOnly option.

I had a go a deleting details via git-annex vicfg and directly editing the git-annex branch log files as detailed [here](http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Reappearing_repos_in_webapp_and_vicfg/).  But still no joy.  

Any hints on what to do?  Nothing in the log seems to help...

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Not sure anymore.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Latest.

### Please provide any additional information below.
