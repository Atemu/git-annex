Thanks for the explanation!  Might be better then to remove Files in Android build to prevent confusion?

OI filemanager http://www.openintents.org/en/filemanager  I believe is open source.  according to app info it is only 1.53MB (thus negligible in comparison) and probably could be 'collaborated with' so they could ship basic support for annex (git annex get/drop)... I just don't know if it would be possible to start existing OI manager under annex user (that would be needed right?).
