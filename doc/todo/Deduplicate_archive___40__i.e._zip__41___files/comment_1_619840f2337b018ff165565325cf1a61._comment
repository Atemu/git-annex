All you need to do is unzip your zip file, and then `git annex add` or `git annex import` its contents. It will then automatically deduplicate.

Due to the way compression works, two zip (or gz) files with identical contents but different checksums are unlikely to share many bytes in common. So git-annex cannot help with de-duplicating unless you unzip them.
