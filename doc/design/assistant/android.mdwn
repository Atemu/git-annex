## goals

1. Get git-annex working at the command line in Android,
   along with all the programs it needs.
2. Get the webapp and assistant working. A hopefully small Java app will be
   developed, which runs the webapp daemon, and a web browser to display it.

Current status: git-annex can be built for Android, with `make android`.
You need <https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android> installed first,
and also have to `cabal install` all necessary dependencies.

### programs to port

These will probably need to be bundled into the Android app, unless already
available in the App Store.

* ssh (native ssh needed for scp, not a client like ConnectBot)
* rsync
* gpg
* git (not all git commands are needed,
  but core plumbing and a few like `git-add` are.)

### Android specific features

The app should be aware of power status, and avoid expensive background
jobs when low on battery or run flat out when plugged in.

The app should be aware of network status, and avoid expensive data
transfers when not on wifi. This may need to be configurable.

## FAT

Due to use of the FAT filesystem, which doesn't do symlinks, [[desymlink]]
is probably needed for at least older Android devices that have SD cards.
