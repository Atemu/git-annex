@joey,

Thanks for your reply. I certainly appreciate you giving your perspective and rationale, and you bring up several good points. I never intended for my comment to be hostile or harsh, and I'm sorry if it struck you that way.

I do believe you acted in the best of intentions, and going back through the devblog and documentation one can follow along and see how this change came about. So the bit about it being casually communicated, as I wrote, is in one sense absolutely false.

And yet, to me, a somewhat recent user (who still find aspects of git-annex and its inner workings hard to grasp at times), it appeared to happen without warning and came pretty much out of nowhere. As you note, there are several reasons for that, and I'm obviously responsible for making sure I understand the tools I use.

As you have touched upon on your personal blog, there are probably some lessons to learn here. I hope we can turn it into something constructive. And mostly, I hope we as a community can avoid putting you in this regrettable position again.

Finally, the solution you have come up with since my post, seems very, very good and should alleviate most, if not all, concerns.
