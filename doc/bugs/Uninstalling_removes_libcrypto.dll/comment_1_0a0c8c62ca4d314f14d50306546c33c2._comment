Hmm, git-annex bundles a libcrypto.dll, and so the uninstallation
process should remove that.

I suspect what's going on is that the uninstaller is accidentially
being told the full path to the library, as it was on the build system.

Hmm, doesn't seem so, relevant code is:

	removefilesFrom d = mapM_ (\f -> delete [RebootOK] $ fromString $ d ++ "/" ++ takeFileName f)

Note `takeFileName`..

Alternate theory: Maybe if git-annex is installed before git, it
installs libcrypto.dll. Then maybe git's installer sees that is installed
and doesn't install its own copy.
