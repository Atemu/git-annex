> Of course, if you can get the content into the git-annex repository by other means like manual cp --reflink, git-annex will never have any reason to transfer the imported file from the remote, so that workaround would work.

FWIW: doing that now.  Minor pain will come later when I will need to update it (only once again) with a new sync'ed data (some files will be added, some removed) -- to simplify my own life I will just `rm -rf` in target git-annex repo, redo `cp --reflink` and redo `datalad save` (which will take care about removing gone, and `git-annex add` on all others -- but that would take again many hours to complete even though only a handful of files will be changed)
