# NAME

git-annex drop - indicate content of files not currently wanted

# SYNOPSIS

git annex drop `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Drops the content of annexed files from this repository, when
possible.

git-annex will refuse to drop content if it cannot verify it is
safe to do so.

# OPTIONS

* `--from=remote`

  Rather than dropping the content of files in the local repository,
  this option can specifiy a remote from which the files'
  contents should be removed.

* `--force`

  Use this option with care! It bypasses safety checks, and forces
  git-annex to delete the content of the specified files, even from
  the last repository that is storing their content. Data loss can
  result from using this option.

* file matching options

  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to drop.
