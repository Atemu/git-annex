Hmm, --fast is not very descriptive for this when it's used with a
directory special remote, because hashing is almost as slow as copying.

Probably better to use --no-content and --content, same as sync.
(Though unfortunately with an opposite default though iirc there are plans
somewhere to transition sync to default to --content).
