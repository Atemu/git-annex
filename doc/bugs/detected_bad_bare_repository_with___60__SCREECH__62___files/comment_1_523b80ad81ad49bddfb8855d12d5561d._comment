To fix this problem, git-annex has to find all the keys in the repository. This is necessarily an expensive operation when the repository is that large. Printing out the count of them does not take any appreciable additional time.

This is a one-time fix up. Once you let git-annex run and fix your repository, you should not be bothered by it again.
