You are right, that the merging picture doesn't work out if you have a \"single entity\" spread across multiple files. Whether that be a version control system like git or mercurial, or a package unpacked by a package manager. I do not plan on doing any merging. I want to esencially store the file trees of Docker images in git annex. What does it even mean to merge two Docker images? Would you expect that when merging an image based on a debian base image which has git installed, with one that has vim installed, that you would get an image with both git and vim? That would be cool, obviously, but I don't think that it is going to happen, and I don't need it to. OSTree doesn't have merging. You cannot merge two Docker images which happen to be based on the same base image...

So while it is true, that tracking multifile entities in git-annex breaks merging, that doesn't make it silly.
