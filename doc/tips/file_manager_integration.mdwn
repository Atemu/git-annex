## general

If your file manager can run a command on a file, it should be easy to
integrate git-annex with it. A simple script will suffice:

	#!/bun/sh
	git-annex get --notify-start --notify-finish "$@"

The --notify-start and --notify-stop options make git-annex display a
desktop notification. This is useful to give the user an indication that
their action took effect. Desktop notifications are currently only
implenented for Linux.
