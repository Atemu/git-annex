A workaround for now is to use a newer GIT from [http://git-for-windows.github.io/](http://git-for-windows.github.io/) which has Git 2.5+ and use the new environment variable GIT_SSH_COMMAND which overrides GIT_SSH so setting

`export GIT_SSH_COMMAND=ssh`  

allows git annex sync to work successfully for me
