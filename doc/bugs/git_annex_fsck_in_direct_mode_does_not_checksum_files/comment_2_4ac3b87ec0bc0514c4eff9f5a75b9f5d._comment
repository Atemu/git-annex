I'm still somewhat confused about the following commit (which seems to suggest fsck in direct mode could actually checksum files):

commit 0da2507fd622120217cf03038b851b47c47ace53

    improve direct mode fsck
    
    An earlier commit (mislabeled) made direct mode fsck check file checksums.
    While it's expected for files to change at any time in direct mode, and so
    fsck cannot complain every time there's a checksum mismatch, it is possible
    for it to detect when a file does not *seem* to have changed, then check
    its checksum, and so detect disk corruption or other problems.
    
    This commit improves that, by checking a second time, if the checksum
    fails, that the file is still not modified, before taking action. This way,
    a direct mode file can be modified while being fscked.
