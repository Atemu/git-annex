This works fine when LANG is set to a utf-8 capable locale. I reproduced it
with LANG=C. quvi outputs utf-8 in that configuration, and git-annex,
following the locale settings, did not know what to do with that. 

Easily fixed, but you'll have better luck in general if you get into a
utf-8 capable locale.
