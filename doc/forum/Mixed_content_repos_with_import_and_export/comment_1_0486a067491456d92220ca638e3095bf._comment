This is one of the still open items in [[todo/import_tree]],
namely "Need to support annex.largefiles when importing"

I don't think there's any major issue implementing it, other than it being
a bit of bother due to things like matching on mime type. I've lifted that
todo out to [[todo/import_tree_should_honor_annex.largefiles]] so hopefully
it'll be more of an action item on my todo list rather than buried away.
