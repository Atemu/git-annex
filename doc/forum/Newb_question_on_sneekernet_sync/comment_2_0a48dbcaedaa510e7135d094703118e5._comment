Well, working with git annex, you should think of two things:

1. location of annex information (git commit tree), I'll call it INFO
2. location of files contents, I'll call it CONTENT

So, for your sneekernet scenario these general steps are required:

1. sync INFO between Laptop A and USB
2. transfer required CONTENT from LAPTOP A to USB
3. sync INFO between Laptop B and USB
4. transfer required CONTENT from USB to Laptop B

Let's describe your options on every step:

1. issue `git annex sync` on Laptop A. Either from within USB or Laptop repo, I prefer Laptop becouse of automatic commit.
2. 
* issue `git annex copy <files> --to=<usb-remote-name>` from within Laptop A repo
   * issue `git annex get <files>` from within USB repo. This is not possible if you have bare repo on USB.
3. issue `git annex sync` on Laptop B
4. same as 2, but transfer to Laptop B
