After more deliberation, there should probably be an option to not have `git annex import` run `git annex add` automagically (but still call `git annex fix`) so manual shuffling around of files is still possible.

See [[doc/bugs/__96__git_annex_fix__96___run_on_non-annexed_files_is_no-op]] for more of the rationale on this.
