Seems we're ruled out nearly anything except for a bug in the aws library
that git-annex uses.

So, I think we need to file a bug on that library. It would be very helpful
to include the library's debugging output with such a bug report. You can
get it by upgrading to git-annex version 5.20150420 or newer, and passing
--debug to git-annex. Should result in some debug logs for aws.

Also, if possible make sure git-annex is built with the newest version of
the aws library. I assume this is easy, since you're using Nix. ;)

(If you're comfortable building haskell programs, it would also be great to
test with Examples/GetObject.hs from the aws package's source, which
has to be modified to use your bucket, and to get the annex-uuid file from
it. If we can get git-annex entirely out of the loop, we can be sure the
bug is in the aws library..)
