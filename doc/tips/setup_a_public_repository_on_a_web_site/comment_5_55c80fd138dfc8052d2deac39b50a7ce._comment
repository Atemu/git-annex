The post is pretty clear but I misinterpreted at first and got stuck for a while, so just in case this helps anyone else:

The issues about the `post-receive` hook running in the `.git` directory and `GIT_DIR` being set to `.` are distinct issues and you might need to fix both them. At first, I thought they were the same thing and just doing `cd ..` would be enough to fix things, but it is not.
