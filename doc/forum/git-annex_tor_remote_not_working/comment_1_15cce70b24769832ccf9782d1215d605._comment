I've just tested it on Debian with tor version 0.4.1.6,
and it worked for me.

It seems to have gotten considerably further in the first error message
you showed than in the second error message.

It's easier to investigate the second problem. git-annex is expecting tor
to have created a directory with a name starting
with "/var/lib/tor/tor-annex_" and with the git-annex UUID of your
repository in its name. Inside that directory, it expects to find a
hostname file that contains a tor onion address.

So tor is not creating that directory or that file, or the file
contains something else. Which one it is will help narrow the problem.
