This bug, introduced in version 5.20131118, caused `git annex init`, when run in a bare repository, to set `core.bare` to false.

I have fixed the bug. I may need to make git-annex detect and automatically fix up after the problem.

To manually fix a bare repository created by the buggy version of git-annex, run `git config core.bare true` in the repository. Then if there's a .git/annex/objects inside the bare git repository, you can move it to annex/objects.
