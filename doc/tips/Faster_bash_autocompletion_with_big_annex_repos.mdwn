I'm currently using git annex to manage my entire file collection
(including tons of music and books) and I noticed how slow
autocompletion has become for files in the index (say for git add).
The main offender is a while-read-case-echo bash loop in
`__git_index_files` that can be readily substituted with a much faster
sed invocation. Here is my benchmark:

```
__git_index_files ()
{
    local dir="$(__gitdir)" root="${2-.}" file;
    if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
        __git_ls_files_helper "$root" "$1" | while read -r file; do
            case "$file" in
                ?*/*)
                    echo "${file%%/*}"
                ;;
                *)
                    echo "$file"
                ;;
            esac;
        done | sort | uniq;
    fi
}

time __git_index_files > /dev/null


__git_index_files ()
{
    local dir="$(__gitdir)" root="${2-.}" file;
    if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
        __git_ls_files_helper "$root" "$1" | \
            sed -r 's@^"?([^/]+)/.*$@\1@' | sort | uniq
    fi
}

time __git_index_files > /dev/null

real    0m0.830s
user    0m0.597s
sys    0m0.310s

real    0m0.345s
user    0m0.357s
sys    0m0.000s
```

So you might redefine `__git_index_files` as above in your .bashrc after sourcing the git autocomplete script.
