Again this error message has nothing to do with git-annex beyond it being a file in the git-annex branch that is corrupt. Your system seems to be repeatedly corrupting git repositories. You need to run `git fsck`, get the git repository in a clean state, and probably check the drive it's on, and run a memory test or otherwise deal with whatever is causing your system to corrupt files in the git repository.
