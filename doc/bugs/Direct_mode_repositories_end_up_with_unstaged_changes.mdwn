### Please describe the problem.

After running two repositories syncing with one another in direct mode "git status" shows unstaged changes in both.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create two direct mode repositories with each other as ssh remotes
2. Run "git annex assistant" on each
3. Create files on each and they get synced
4. Run "git status"

In my current repository the output is:

[[!format sh """
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	typechange: fromgolias
#	typechange: fromwintermute
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
"""]]
