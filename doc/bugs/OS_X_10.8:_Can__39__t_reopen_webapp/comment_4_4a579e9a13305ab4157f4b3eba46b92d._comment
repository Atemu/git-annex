There's clearly something not quite right with how the program is started on OSX. I've had reports about the app icon \"bouncing\" for a long time, and now this. 

Since I do not own a Mac, and only have VNC access to a Mac desktop one for about 1 hour a week (and that's pretty slow), doing anything to improve this is quite a low priority background task for me.

It seems that, as a non-Cocoa application, there are only a couple of behaviors that git-annex could have that play into this. 

Perhaps the problem is that if the git-annex assistant daemon is not already running (it's supposed to autostart on login, but this may not be working, or perhaps git-annex has only just been installed and has not started yet), git-annex-webapp runs the daemon, and keeps it running, in the foreground. Perhaps this is interpreted by the GUI as an app that has not finished starting up, or as an app that is already running so it does not re-run it when the icon is clicked on again (which would run git-annex webapp and have it open a new browser window). This should be easy to play around with, by just editing the `git-annex-webapp` shell script. For example, adding a \"&\" at the end of the last line in the file would make it instead run in the background.

Or, the problem might be with the .plist file for the app. Perhaps there's some change that could be made to it that would clue OSX in on how git-annex works.
