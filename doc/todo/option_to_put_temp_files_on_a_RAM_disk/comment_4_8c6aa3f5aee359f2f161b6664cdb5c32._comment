When git-annex downloads chunks, it uses a single file and seeks forward to
the next chunk boundry when resuming, for example.

I agree with chrysn's analysis on all points.

Also, this smells of premature optimisation, and tying it to features that
have not even been agreed on, let alone implemented or profiled, is weird.
