My NetListener workaround turned out to not be portable enough.

However, I have sent a patch to fix the FD leak: <https://github.com/audreyt/network-multicast/pull/6>
Hopefully it gets applied soon.

I have also made the PairListener only retry every 60 seconds. Which makes the leak 1/60th as bad, for whatever that's worth.

Once a fix for this gets into Debian, I need to remember to backport it to stable, and update the autobuilders to use it. Also need to remember to update the Android autobuilder. Leaving this bug report open until that happens.
