I want to store my annex on google cloud storage (GCS) and load files from the annex on GCS directly into Big Query for processing. I'm planning on using DataLad's gitannex features. I'm thinking this kind of approach is needed to avoid the overhead of downloading to the server where the Datalad git repo is running and the need for space to store it on the regular file system.  Is anything like this possible?
