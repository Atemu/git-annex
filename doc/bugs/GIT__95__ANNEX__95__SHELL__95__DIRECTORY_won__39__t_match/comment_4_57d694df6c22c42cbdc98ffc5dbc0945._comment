Ok, this involves the fairly recently added support for
avoding overlapping ssh password prompts when running multiple ssh
processes concurrently.

In -J mode, git-annex warms up the ssh connection by running
"git-annex-shell inannex". Your rrsync config prevents that being run.

This doesn't actually cause a problem, the connection is still warmed up.
If you needed a password to connect, it would have prompted for it before
the error message from rrsync.

But it's ugly.. I've committed a fix that will avoid the ugly messages.
