Another [[special_remote|special_remotes]] that git-annex can use is
a [[special_remotes/bup]] repository. Bup stores large file contents
in a git repository of its own, with deduplication. Combined with
git-annex, you can have git on both the frontend and the backend.

Here's how to create a bup remote, and describe it.

	# git annex initremote mybup type=bup encryption=none remote=example.com/big/mybup
	initremote bup (bup init)
	Initialized empty Git repository in /big/mybup/
	ok
	# git annex describe mybup "my bup repository at example.com"
	describe mybup ok

Now the remote can be used like any other remote.

	# git annex move my_cool_big_file --to mybup
	move my_cool_big_file (to mybup...)
	Receiving index from server: 1100/1100, done.
	ok

See [[special_remotes/bup]] for details.
