git-annex stores the uuid of a S3 remote inside the bucket for various reasons. Now that you have removed all knowledge of the remote from the repository, when you attempt to reuse the same bucket for some reason, git-annex has no way to know that this is a remote it used to use with that bucket.

I think this behavior is entirely reasonable. Also, it's not what you filed the original bug report about; I fixed that bug. I'm going to re-close this.
