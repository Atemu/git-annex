Unfortunately I get a build failure when building this version using Cabal:

    [113 of 183] Compiling Assistant.Changes ( Assistant/Changes.hs, dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Assistant/Changes.o )

    Assistant/Changes.hs:73:30:
        Not in scope: `tryReadTChan'
        Perhaps you meant `readTChan' (imported from Control.Concurrent.STM)
    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    git-annex-3.20120624 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1

The complete build log is at <http://paste.debian.net/176125/>.  I'm looking forward to trying out the new watch behaviour!
