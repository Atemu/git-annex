Hello all!

I'm doing tests with git annex to see how it works, and to start with it I'm trying to track my /home using some kind of a *white list* with .gitignore.

So I have this .gitignore file:

    /*
    !/web
    
    !/Desktop
    /Desktop/*
    !/Desktop/Work

and when I do *git annex add .* it works as expected: It adds only ~/web and ~/Desktop/Work... but when I do *git annex status* it shows me the entire /home... it seems that *git annex status* doesn't use .gitignore... is this a bug or an intended behavior?

Thanks for your time :)
