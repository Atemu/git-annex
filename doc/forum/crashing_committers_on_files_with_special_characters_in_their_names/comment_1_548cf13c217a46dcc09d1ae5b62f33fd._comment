You forgot to include

* A version number
* An error message
* A way to reproduce the problem.

Without this information, I cannot help you, except to say that git-annex is very careful not to care at all about the contents or encoding of filenames and has been used with a wide variety of filenames, including all characters you listed, without any known problems.
