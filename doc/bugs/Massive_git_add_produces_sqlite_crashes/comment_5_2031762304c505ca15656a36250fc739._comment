I saw these crashes the last couple of times I tried git-annex in WSL, just
running `git annex test` would immediately cause them. Before that it had
used to work ok, I even saw a full test suite pass under WSL before. But it
seems that something in the emulation layer has broken to the point that
sqlite is crashing.

I think the problem only affects using v6 mode?
