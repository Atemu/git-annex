First, you should try \"git annex get\" on that file and see if works. If it simply outputs nothing, then you indeed somehow committed a hash link. Use \"git log --stat\" and look for the commit that changed the file, then copy the commit-id of the commit before that. Then you can get the old version of the file with \"git checkout <commit-id> -- <file>\".
