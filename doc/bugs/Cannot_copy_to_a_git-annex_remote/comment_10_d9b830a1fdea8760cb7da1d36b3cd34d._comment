Hi,

This looks like the exact same issue as [get failed, but remote has the file](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/get_failed__44___but_remote_has_the_file/).
I can reproduce your problem here by doing a `git annex copy --to bucket bigfile.gz`, then stopping that transfer with `^Z`, and finally running the `copy` command
again.  It will fail with the same debug output as you show here.
