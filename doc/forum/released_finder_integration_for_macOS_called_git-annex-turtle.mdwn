I just released a new app (in beta) for macOS called [git-annex-turtle](https://github.com/andrewringler/git-annex-turtle). It provides badges in finder, context menus and very limited status updates via a menubar icon. **Requires** macOS 10.12 or later.

Badges indicate whether files are present or not, how many copies they have and if they are lacking copies. Context menus (currently very limited) allow for add/get/drop/lock and unlock. A menubar icon gives (currently very limited) feedback on current operations.

The is definitely a preview beta release so there are bound to be bugs. Please report any feature requests or bugs with github issues, by emailing me directly at <a href="mailto:public@andrewringler.com">public@andrewringler.com</a> or posting comments to this thread.

Thanks!


Andrew
