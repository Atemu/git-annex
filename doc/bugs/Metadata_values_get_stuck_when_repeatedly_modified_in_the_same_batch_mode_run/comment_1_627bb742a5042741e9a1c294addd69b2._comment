I thought this would involve the journal, but it seems not; same
behavior occurs if the journal is committed after each metadata change.

Looking at the new metadata value in the case where a and c both get set,
it is:

	MetaData (fromList [(MetaField "f",fromList [MetaValue (CurrentlySet True) "a",MetaValue (CurrentlySet False) "c"])])

That is supposed to unset c, with the CurrentlySet False, but instead c
remains set somehow.
