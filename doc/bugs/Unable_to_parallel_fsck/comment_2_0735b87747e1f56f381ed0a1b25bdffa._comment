I finished the use-bytestring branch, but that turns out not to work; once
the FilePath is converted to a ByteString, all the specially encoded
characters don't get decoded back properly, and so the result is a bunch of

I think that for this to work, System.Console.Regions would need to use
String exclusively, and probably System.Console.Concurrent would too. Which
would probably slow it down and complicate it significantly.
