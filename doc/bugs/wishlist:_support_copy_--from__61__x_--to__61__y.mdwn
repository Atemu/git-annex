I'd like to be able to:

    git annex copy --from=x --to=y .

Use case (true story) follows:

My desktop hard drive was filling up. I dropped some large files which are also stored (via git-annex) on my backup drive. While these aren't irreplaceable files, I'd prefer to have at least two copies of everything I've decided I care enough about to archive. Later, I get a 2nd external drive, and I:

    git annex copy --to=new-external-drive .

Fantastic! Now I've got everything that was important/useful enough to keep on my desktop backed up a 2nd time onto my new drive.

But my new drive doesn't have a copy of any of the files I dropped from my desktop. I would like to be able to:

    git annex copy --from=old-external-drive --to=new-external-drive .

on my desktop, and then my new drive would have a copy of everything, and my desktop drive would still have plenty of space (ie the files I'd dropped to make space would still not be stored on the desktop).

The git repos on these external drives are both bare (as in ``git init --bare``) because they are used only for backups. Thus I operate on them only as remotes from my main (desktop) repo.
