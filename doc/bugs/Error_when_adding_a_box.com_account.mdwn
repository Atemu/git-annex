What steps will reproduce the problem?

 * Start git annex assistant
 * Setup a local repository
 * Setup a remote box.com repository: set user & password, uncheck "share with friends", click "add repository"

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I get an internal server error message, instead of a confirmation message, and the repository is obviously not created:
   
    Internal Server Error
    HandshakeFailed (Error_Protocol ("certificate rejected: certificate is not allowed to sign another certificate",True,CertificateUnknown))

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Git annex 3.20130216, on Debian/testing
