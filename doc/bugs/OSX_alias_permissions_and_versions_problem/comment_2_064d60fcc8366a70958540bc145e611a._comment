It seems many people complain about symlink behavior in Lion and Mountain Lion.
I never used symlinks to files often, only to folders.
I hope you can solve this problems and make it work correctly in OSX, or use hardlinks instead.
Git annex sound awesome, but the people using the assistant will want KISS behavior, and don't even know what a symbolic link is.
