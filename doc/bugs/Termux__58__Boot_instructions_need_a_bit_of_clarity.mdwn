This is a bug report about the "Starting at power on" section of the documentation in <http://git-annex.branchable.com/Android/>, which says:

>If you install the Termux:Boot app, git-annex will automatically be automatically started when your Android device powers on. It will run in the background in whatever repositories you have set up in the webapp.
>(Or have listed in (or listed in ~/.config/git-annex/autostart)

This gives rise to several questions:

Will it really be automatically started without any additional configuration from the user?  That's what the first sentence appears to claim, but it appears to contradict <https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:Boot#Usage> which suggests that manual configuration of `~/.termux/boot` is required.

But if it's really true, exactly what `git-annex` command will be automatically started?  Since running with no arguments simply outputs usage text.

Or if manual configuration of `~/.termux/boot` *is* required, what exactly should that look like?  Should it be `git annex assistant --autostart`, as per [[forum/Autostart_the_assistant]]?

What's the format of the contents of `~/.config/git-annex/autostart`?

Finally, the last sentence has unbalanced parentheses, and doesn't parse correctly.
