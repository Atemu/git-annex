Yes, that flag disables building with webdav. And if the build environment
is limited in some way that the DAV dependency is not available, that flag
can be turned on automatically by the dependency resolver.

Probably guix needs to package the [DAV library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/DAV)
or add it to the dependencies of the package such that it's available
to build with.

Actually, I've gone ahead and removed the build flag in the next git-annex
version, so it will always be required to build.
