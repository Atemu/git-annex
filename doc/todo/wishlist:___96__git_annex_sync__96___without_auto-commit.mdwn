I would like to have way, ideally a per-repo-cloud setting which syncs around automatically, to not have `git annex sync` autocommit staged additions.

I often have quite complex additions with a mix of `git add` and `git annex add` in various stages of completion; running `git annex sync` regularly to see what state the other repos are in should not autocommit if possible.
