What you're suggesting with the full filenames is basically on the same
level of complexity as direct mode or v6's unlocked files, which both avoid
symlinks and so avoid problems with the rare program that looks at the
extension of a symlink target, instead of the extension of the symlink.

Doing something to allow longer extensions is maybe worth talking more
about though. I am not very keen on adding a parameter to the backend name.

The way git-annex picks extensions doesn't need to be stable across all
versions of git-annex, because it's only done when initially adding a file,
and then the key, with whatever extension, is added as-is and git-annex
does not care about the extension thereafter. So, a
configuration setting to pick the extension length, or something like that,
would be possible to add.
