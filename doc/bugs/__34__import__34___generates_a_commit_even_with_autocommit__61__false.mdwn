### Please describe the problem.

`git annex import` generates a commit in the `git-annex` branch even if `autocommit` has been disabled.

It happens in direct mode, I haven't tested with indirect mode.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git config --global annex.autocommit false
    git annex direct
    git annex import --force ~/Documents/*.pdf

    git log git-annex # see the newly created commit

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 5.20140421 from the Ubuntu PPA.
