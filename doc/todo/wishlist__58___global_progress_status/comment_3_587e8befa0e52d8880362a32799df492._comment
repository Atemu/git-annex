git-annex does not display rsync progress any longer, but you do still 
get the progress display on a per-file basis. This is at least a lot more
compact than the rsync output.

Any kind of global progress display would require a separate pass to
identify all the files that git-annex will be operating on. That would make
it slower in large repos, and people already complain about seek speed in
large repos.
