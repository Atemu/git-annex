Not the above was done using git-annex webapp. I have also tried the same from cmdline with the same results:


[[!format sh \"\"\"
#Once remote added

➜  test_move_bp git:(annex/direct/master) git annex enableremote macrepo
zsh:1: command not found: git-annex-shell

  Remote macrepo does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore
git-annex: Unknown special remote name.
(No special remotes are currently known; perhaps use initremote instead?)


#However the ssh works fine:

➜  test_move_bp git:(annex/direct/master) ssh pmichalec@ape-mac-mini.local

➜  ~  /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex-shell
git-annex-shell: bad parameters

Usage: git-annex-shell [-c] command [parameters ...] [option ...]

configlist    DIRECTORY          outputs relevant git configuration
dropkey       DIRECTORY KEY ...  drops annexed content for specified keys

notifychanges DIRECTORY          sends notification when git refs are changed
recvkey       DIRECTORY KEY      runs rsync in server mode to receive content
sendkey       DIRECTORY KEY      runs rsync in server mode to send content
