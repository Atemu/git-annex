You're only meant to use one of --incremental, or --more, or --incremental-schedule at a time. I have made fsck refuse to accept combinations of those options.

What was happening is that, since you didn't understand the documentation (which is possibly not as clear as it could be; I have tried to improve it now), the --incremental option you passed dominated all the other options, and made it start a *new* incremental fsck each time. Which means it started from the beginning and fscked every file until you stopped it.

I agree that it would be better if fsck --fast --incremental did not collide with fsck --incremental. There is already a bug about that: [[incremental fsck should not use sticky bit]].

Finally, I agree that losing the \"(checksum)\" made fsck output less informative. Although I don't think it is needed in the `git annex add` output. I have made it be shown in only the fsck output.
