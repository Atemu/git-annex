### Please describe the problem.


some time ago i was using the webapp bound to a dedicated port number to get around firewall reconfig. Now after some time without using the webapp i'm using it again and when i start it with 

     git-annex webapp --listen=192.168.21.12:46199

it never starts but just keeps waiting forever(?) 

Update:(to clarify - the following works fine but results in the "random" port "problem")

    git-annex webapp --listen=192.168.21.12




### What steps will reproduce the problem?


git-annex webapp --listen=192.168.21.12:46199


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


version 5.20140716-g8c14ba8 on debian wheezy using your pre build static tar archive. 

### Please provide any additional information below.
