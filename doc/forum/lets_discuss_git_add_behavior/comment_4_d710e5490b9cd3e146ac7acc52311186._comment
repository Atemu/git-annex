Another reason it's not always \"preferable for the mistake to be adding the file content to the annex, vs adding the file content to git\", is that adding it as *unlocked* annexed files can cause [[slowness|bugs/git_status_extremely_slow_with_v7]], can cause files to be unexpectedly missing from new clones until they're explicitly [[gotten|git-annex-get]], etc.  The tradeoffs depend on the use case.

\"Suppose you have an unlocked file in your repo, and you rename it\" -- maybe, git-annex could keep track of local unlocked files by inode, not just by path name?

\"The best way seems to be for git-annex to somehow be able to distinguish between them. And that's what annex.largefiles lets it do\" -- can there be an `annex.largefiles_git_add` variable that, if defined, is used by `git add` but not by [[`git annex add`|git-annex-add]]?  Then one can set `annex.largefiles_git_add=nothing` to get the former default behavior, while still controlling `git-annex-add` behavior as before.
