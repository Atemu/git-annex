git-annex info - shows information about the specified item or the repository as a whole

# SYNOPSIS

git annex info `[directory|file|remote|uuid ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Displays statistics and other information for the specified item,
which can be a directory, or a file, or a remote, or the uuid of a
repository.
  
When no item is specified, displays statistics and information
for the repository as a whole.

# OPTIONS

* `--fast`

  Only show the data that can be gathered quickly.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* file matching options

  When a directory is specified, the [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to select the files in the directory that are included
  in the statistics.

# EXAMPLES

Suppose you want to run "git annex get .", but
would first like to see how much disk space that will use.
Then run:
  
	git annex info --fast . --not --in here
