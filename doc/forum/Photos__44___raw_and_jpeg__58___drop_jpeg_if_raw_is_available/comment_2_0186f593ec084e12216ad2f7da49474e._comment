Thanks for the idea. The reason I want to get rid of the jpegs is not that I see them as derivatives of the raw (for my most recent camera they are since it can reprocess the raws), but that I consider them less important. On my notebook computer I do not have enough space to keep all the files anymore. Therefore I want to get rid of the less important ones, which means that later I want to also remove the raws with less than 2 stars rating, and the movie clips I do not work on currently. On the external hard disk, all the files are present anytime. The backup is separate, the git-annex setup is just for extending my notebooks hard disk drive since industry fails for years to come up with 2.5\" drives larger than 2 TB in 9.5 mm height. So I think what you are describing is another use case. Automatically recognizing raw+jpeg pairs would just be partial automation of my workflow. Or did I miss something?
