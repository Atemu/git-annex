I've fixed the repeated \"(gpg)\" problem. But that is not the real problem...

Looks to me like there is a problem with running gpg to extract the encryption key of the repository. I can cause the same \"resource vanished\" message if I make gpg exit 1 immediately when it starts. I also managed to get 3 zombies when failing to send 100 files. Although in my case they were gpg zombies, not git-annex zombies.

Can you run `gpg` manually at the command line? If you installed git-annex from the OSX dmg file, you need to have used \"runshell\" to get the gpg that's included in it onto the PATH before you do this.
