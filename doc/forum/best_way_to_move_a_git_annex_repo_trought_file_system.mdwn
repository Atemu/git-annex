Hi all,
i'm looking for the right command to move a git annex repo througt filesystem without breaking all the symlink and so and without changing the id of the repo.
My current hard drive have become to small to store all what i have so i have bought a new on and have mounted it in a directory named shared, now i want to
move all my repo (repo1 repo2 etc...) too shared can anyone give me the best move option to do that ?

best regards.
