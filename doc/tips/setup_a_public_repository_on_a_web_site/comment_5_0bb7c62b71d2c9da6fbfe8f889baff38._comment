I'm trying to set up a read-only HTTP mirror of my repository, such that I can clone and get files but not upload anything. I've set up an HTTP file server pointing to the repository, and I can clone it over git (dumb protocol):

```
$ git clone http://server.name/annex/.git clone_test
Cloning into 'clone_test'...              
Fetching objects: 1987364, done.
Checking connectivity: 1987364, done.
Updating files: 100% (551410/551410), done.
```

However, git-annex doesn't seem to like it:

```
$ cd clone_test/
$ git annex init
init  (merging origin/git-annex into git-annex...)
(recording state in git...)       
(scanning for unlocked files...)      
                                                           
  Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore
ok
(recording state in git...)
```

And thereafter I can't get any of the files using `git annex get`:

```
$ git annex get file.name
get file.name (not available)
  Maybe add some of these git remotes (git remote add ...):
    (...)
  (Note that these git remotes have annex-ignore set: origin)
failed                                           
git-annex: get: 1 failed                  
$ git annex get file.name --from=origin
git-annex: cannot determine uuid for origin (perhaps you need to run \"git annex sync\"?) (remote.origin.annex-ignore is set)
```

Running `git annex sync` fails for inability to push to origin, which is as expected since it's meant to be read-only.

How can I get git-annex to fetch data over this http remote?
