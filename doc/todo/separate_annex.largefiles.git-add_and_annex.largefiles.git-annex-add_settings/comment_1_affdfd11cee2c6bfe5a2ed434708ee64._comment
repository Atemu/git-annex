I am not convinced that making this configurable does anything other than
give users a new way to shoot themselves in their foot, and adding another
config setting I have to tease out of them in the ensuring bug report.

My comment on [[forum/lets_discuss_git_add_behavior]] describes scenarios
where such a git add behavior would result in accidentially adding large
files to the git object store.

The only way that would seem to avoid that is a config setting that
disables all support for populating annexed unlocked files, as well as
making git-add not smudge them, so the repository is basically treated
just like a v5 repository.
