With the storage layout v3, pulling the git-annex branch into the master branch is... less than ideal.

The fact that the two branches contain totally different data make an accidental merge worse, arguably.

Adding a tiny binary file called .gitnomerge to both branches would solve that without any noticeable overhead.

Yes, there is an argument to be made that this is too much hand-holding, but I still think it's worth it.
