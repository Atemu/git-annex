I guess one difference is be that other repos may erroneously think a file is present in the special remote when, in actuality, it has been deleted. (That's what trust/semitrust is for, right?)  
In my use-case it doesn't make much of a difference since the special remote will rarely see a deletion but I can imagine there might also be ones where it could end catastrophically.

A better solution all around would probably be to enable the user to override a special remote's perceived locking ability somehow (and only that, no other trust factors).

Having a runtime switch for temporarily trusting special remotes to lock files would be useful in any case though IMO.
