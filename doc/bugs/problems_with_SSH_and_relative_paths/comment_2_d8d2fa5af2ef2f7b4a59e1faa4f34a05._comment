I was going to say, I have repos with relative ssh paths that I use with
git-annex every day.

This seems likely to be a problem with how git-annex
is installed on the server, that is preventing running git-annex-shell
there. Ie, it should work to run `ssh remote.example.com git-annex-shell`.

Sometimees there can be tricky problems with PATH not getting set as usual
when sshing, see  [[tips/get_git-annex-shell_into_PATH]].

I don't know how the absolute path could have seemed to work, and then
seemed to fail when you tried it again later. My guess would be, something
must have changed on the server in the meantime.
