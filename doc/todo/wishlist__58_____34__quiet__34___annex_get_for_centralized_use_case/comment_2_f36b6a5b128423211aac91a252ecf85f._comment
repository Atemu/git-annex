What would happen if we wanted to copy a file to the server 
with that set? or even when running `git annex add`
You understood me exactly though.
We'd like to be able to get the files without a commit, but copy them 
with a commit of the changes.
The way we operate, if somebody makes a change with regards to 
largefiles, they should also add a test for it.
Ideally, the test suite would catch it.  That or people would 
realize that theres a new big file and send around an email to 
see who was trying to a largefile when they couldn't reach it.
