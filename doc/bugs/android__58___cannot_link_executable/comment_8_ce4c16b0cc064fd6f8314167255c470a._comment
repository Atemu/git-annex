We may be moving away from the git-annex Android app, and to running
git-annex in Termux on Android.

I think that will avoid this particular problem, since it uses the linux
build of git-annex which bundles the linux linker, so the behavior of the
android linker is no longer an issue.

If the people who have been bitten by this bug want to give it a try, 
see <http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/install_on_Android_in_Termux/>
