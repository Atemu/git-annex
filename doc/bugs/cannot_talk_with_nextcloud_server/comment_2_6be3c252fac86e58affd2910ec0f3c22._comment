> So are you saying this webdav server responds with an error when a directory creation is attempted,

well, not quite. the *webserver* responds with that error because git-annex tries to create https://example.net/ - it does not hit the nextcloud webdav endpoint, which is at https://example.net/nextcloud/remote.php/webdav

I don't think it autocreates directories at all. The problem is `getProps /` fails because there's no webdav server at the root of the FWDN - it's in a sub-sub-directory instead....
