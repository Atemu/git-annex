That change would lead to buggy behavior, because git-annex would then not
commit the journal files, and the optimisation prevents it reading the
journal files, so it would operate with out of date information.

The only way to fix this, I think, is to disable the entire optimisation
when annex.alwayscommit is set and the journal is dirty.
