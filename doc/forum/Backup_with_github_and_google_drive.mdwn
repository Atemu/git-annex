Hi,

I would like to use Github and Google drive to transfer my files across devices. Here is what I've done so far :

* Creating a local repo
* Adding the files with `git annex add`
* Pushing the files to google drive
* Pushing the metadata to github
* Cloning the github repo

But I can't seem to get my files on the second repo from github. The naive way :

    git annex get 1.pdf
    Invalid command: 'git-annex-shell 'configlist' '/~/myid/papers''
    You appear to be using ssh to clone a git:// URL.
    Make sure your core.gitProxy config option and the
    GIT_PROXY_COMMAND environment variable are NOT set.

    Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore

    This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git config remote.origin.annex-ignore false

After initializing the google drive remote on the second repo, I can't download the files :

    git annex get 1.pdf --from googledrive
     20:03:19 [googledriveannex-0.2.1] startRemote : '['GETAVAILABILITY']'

After describing the remote with `git annex describe googledrive "my remote"`, it does nothing :

    git annex get 1.pdf --from googledrive
