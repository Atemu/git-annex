Hi Joe,

I have been using git-annex since several years now and am really happy with it.

But the addition of git-lfs support was, in my humble opinion, an extraordinary leap forward! After gitlab ceased support in favour of lfs and with the advent of lfs in github, annex-integration with widespread used collaborative git-platforms was not very straight-forward anymore. And so it became harder to justify or promote it's use in my institute or other organizations I work for. This has change now again for the better!

So thank you very much for all the hard work and regarding the daunting speed with which new developments and features (version 8 already!) arrive here: Please take good care and do not overstrain yourself. 

Kind regards,

JÃ¶rn
