Looking over all my comments now that I have an implementatation..

`git annex dead` on a sameas remote name marks the parent remote dead.
I think this is ok; dead means the content is gone, so which remote is used
to access it is immaterial; they're all dead.

sameas loops are not a problem, it only looks up the sameas-uuid value
once, will not loop.

old git-annex are prevented from enabling a sameas remote, since it has no
name=

old git-annex with an enabled sameas remote will see the annex-uuid of the
parent, and treat it as the parent. Some git config values needed to use
the parent may not be set, or may potentially be set differently than for
the parent. Unlikely to cause any bad behavior, other than the remote not
working.

encrypted data and legacy chunking is inherited, and cannot be overridden

RemoteConfig always contains any inherited parameters of a sameas remote.
Logs.Remote.configSet filters those out.

Logs.Remote.configSet is a little bit less safe; if its caller passed the
RemoteConfig from a sameas remote, it needs to make sure to not pass the
uuid of the parent remote, or it will overwrite the wrong config. All calls
to it handle that now.

per-remote state still to be done.
