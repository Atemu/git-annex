   * Use haskell Crypto library instead of haskell SHA library.
   * Remove testpack from build depends for non x86 architectures where it
     is not available. The test suite will not be run if it cannot be compiled.
   * Avoid using absolute paths when staging location log, as that can
     confuse git when a remote's path contains a symlink. Closes: #[621386](http://bugs.debian.org/621386)"""]]
