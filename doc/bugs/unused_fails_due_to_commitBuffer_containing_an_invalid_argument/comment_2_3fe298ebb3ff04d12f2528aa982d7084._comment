Hi Joey, thanks for the quick response. 

I tried to update and retry my \"git annex unused\" but it gave the same error. Maybe my updating did not work (see below). But is there a way I can retry it without running \"git annex unused\" again? The problem is that each run takes several hours with my amount of files. 
It would be nice, if git annex recognized some error in the last approach and recovered.
The tmp files that are created by \"git annex unused\" are still in .git/annex/.


Regarding the updating:
I tried to obtain the autobuild version but on this website I could not find a link to download the latest autobuild. I could only find the build reports. But I used the git annex installer script from https://github.com/zerodogg/scriptbucket/blob/master/gitannex-install
and it apparently knows the location of the daily build. Is this the autobuild or is git annex autobuilt more often?

This is my version after installing it yesterday evening approx. 2h hours after your answer to the bug description.
