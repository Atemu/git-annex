The git-annex assistant uses XMPP to communicate between peers that
cannot directly talk to one-another. A typical scenario is two users
who share a repository, that is stored in the [[cloud]].

### TODO

* Prevent idle disconnection. Probably means sending or receiving pings,
  but would prefer to avoid eg pinging every 60 seconds as some clients do.
* XMPP pairing
* git pushes over XMPP (needed for pairing, but also awesome on their own)

## design goals

1. Avoid user-visible messages. dvcs-autosync uses XMPP similarly, but
   sends user-visible messages. Avoiding user-visible messages lets
   the user configure git-annex to use his existing XMPP account
   (eg, Google Talk).

2. Send notifications to buddies. dvcs-autosync sends only self-messages,
   but that requires every node have the same XMPP account configured.
   git-annex should support that mode, but it should also send notifications
   to a user's buddies. (This will also allow for using XMPP for pairing
   in the future.)

3. Don't make account appear active. Just because git-annex is being an XMPP
   client, it doesn't mean that it wants to get chat messages, or make the
   user appear active when he's not using his chat program.

## protocol

To avoid relying on XMPP extensions, git-annex communicates
using presence messages. These always mark it as extended away.
To this, it adds its own tag as [extended content](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html#presence-extended).
The xml namespace is "git-annex" (not an URL because I hate wasting bandwidth).

To indicate it's pushed changes to a git repo with a given UUID, a client uses:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' push="uuid[,uuid...]" />

Multiple UUIDs can be listed when multiple clients were pushed. If the
git repo does not have a git-annex UUID, an empty string is used.

### security

Data git-annex sends over XMPP will be visible to the XMPP
account's buddies, to the XMPP server, and quite likely to other interested
parties. So it's important to consider the security exposure of using it.

Even if git-annex sends only a single bit notification, this lets attackers
know when the user is active and changing files. Although the assistant's other
syncing activities can somewhat mask this.

As soon as git-annex does anything unlike any other client, an attacker can
see how many clients are connected for a user, and fingerprint the ones
running git-annex, and determine how many clients are running git-annex.

If git-annex sent the UUID of the remote it pushed to, this would let
attackers determine how many different remotes are being used,
and map some of the connections between clients and remotes.

An attacker could replay push notification messages, reusing UUIDs it's
observed. This would make clients pull repeatedly, perhaps as a DOS.
