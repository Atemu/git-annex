Hm, IMHO such a “dry-run” flag would be most beneficial for better understanding the preferred/required content settings and try their effect while working on finding the right expression. Therefore, the “drop”, “get” and “sync --content” commands would benefit from such a flag, especially in combination with flags such as “--auto”. Maybe it's just me, but I am not able to utilize the “find” command in a way that it respects preferred content and numcopies and further settings in the same way as the three commands above would do, and testing preferred content expressions is therefore a blind flight.
