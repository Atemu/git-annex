### Please describe the problem.

The install script [[install/Android/git-annex-install]] only adds an entry to `$PATH` which lasts for as long as the shell used for the install.  Subsequent launches of termux will not find `git-annex` on the `$PATH`.

I'm puzzled why this hasn't been reported before.  Is everyone on Android manually running `./git-annex.linux/git-annex ...` each time, or have they manually set up `$PATH` in their Termux shell profile without reporting back to the community, or am I missing something else?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

- Install `git-annex` on Android as per [[Android]]
- Quit the shell used during install
- Relaunch termux
- Try to run `git-annex`

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20180927-gc5b6c55af on Android P

I know this is probably old now but I can't see any evidence the installer fixed this issue since I last tried.  Happy to be told I'm wrong.

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, been using it for many years and couldn't live without it.
