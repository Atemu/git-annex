Well, Sak7.pdf is not a git-annex object filename. And .git/annex/tmp used to be used as a general-purpose temp directory, but in recent versions we're moving away from that; it's only supposed to contain git-annex objects.

So, this must be a leftover file from an old version of git-annex. I don't know offhand what would create a symlink in the temp directory. However, the crash is from the code that was added to the assistant to clean up such left behind files. So, I'll fix that code.
