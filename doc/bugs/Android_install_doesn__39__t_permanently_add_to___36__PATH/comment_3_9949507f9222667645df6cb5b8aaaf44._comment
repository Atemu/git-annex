Yep, that's the same installer. After running it on my phone, I have a `~/.profile`:

```
$ cat .profile
PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/git-annex.linux
```

The code that adds it is in `~/git-annex.linux/runshell` (which is a shell script). That'd be a good place to start debugging if your `~/.profile` doesn't have the path line.
