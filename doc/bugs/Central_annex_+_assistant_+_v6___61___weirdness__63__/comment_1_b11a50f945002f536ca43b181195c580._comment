I'd recommend not using the assistant with v6 repos yet. v6 is
still considered experimental.

In v6 mode, the "/annex/objects/" file content means that an unlocked file's
content is not locally available yet.

I reproduced this, and here's the log for a single file "bar" which was
created on clientA:

    git-annex in clientB

 bar | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

    git-annex in clientA

 bar | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
</pre>

So, it looks like clientB changed it for some reason.

And, 7493e6fd3acc936ff943283df9aa82ba3ad5f94e3c3168c2599f4fdf9a8c504d is the sha256sum of
"/annex/objects/SHA256E-s30--325229d85342c107421616848843592c2c1335d4d4e429b2805765af07de59be\n", so
it's getting confused and re-adding pointer files, it seems.
