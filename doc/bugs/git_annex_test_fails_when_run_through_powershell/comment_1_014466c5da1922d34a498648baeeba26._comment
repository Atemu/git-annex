Could you paste more of the output, in particular you only pasted where it
says that the addurl test failed, but didn't show any error message there
might have been for that test.

The "cannot move" message is not an error message from an external "mv"
command. This error comes from Win32.moveFileEx, which fails on cross-device
renames.

Of course, import is supposed to work across devices, and the code
calls `moveFile`, which is supposed to catch rename errors and fall
back to an external mv command. Seems that fallback is not working on
Windows.
