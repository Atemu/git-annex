I guess whatever this is, running `git annex pre-commit`
would probably reproduce it, and then you could add the --debug flag and it
would show what program it's trying to run when this happens.

I don't know why it would not display the name of a program it's tried to
run. But I guess it's probably a program, since that seems to be the most
likely thing that would be broken by running git-annex in this unusual way.
