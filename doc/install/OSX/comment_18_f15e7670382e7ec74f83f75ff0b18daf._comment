I got the git-annex assistant to work once a long time ago when I ran it the first time directly from the dmg. Ever since then (i.e., after putting it in my applications folder) I have never gotten it to run. Wondering if anyone else has experienced this?

I am running OSX 10.7.5 and just pulled the latest app (05-Apr-2013 10:17).

For reference, when I try to kick off the the assistant from the command line I get the error:
$ open /Applications/git-annex.app
LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/git-annex.app.

I am wondering if there is some sort of file or modification that was made when I accidently kicked it off initially from the dmg, if so any thoughts on what to clear / change?
