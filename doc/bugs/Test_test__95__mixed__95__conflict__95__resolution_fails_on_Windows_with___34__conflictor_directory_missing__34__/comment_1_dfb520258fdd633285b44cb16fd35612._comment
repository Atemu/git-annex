This 1 test is still failing for me on Windows 7 Pro with the latest release (git-annex version: 5.20140128-gddb2083).

I also followed the manual steps provided in the initial bug report.  This resulted in two cloned repos which appeared to have resolved the conflict differently.  Upon further investigation, I see that the conflict was in fact resolved consistently, just that the file sizes in the working directories are different because the file contents has not been synced (so some files contain the \"symlink\" path rather than the actual contents).

After running a sync in both repositories with the new --contents option, the two working directories appear to be resolved consistently.
