> You need to use git config to set that, not git-annex config.

Unless I am getting crazy, I am pretty sure I managed to make that command work before with git-annex (the --set option is not in the git config syntax), so I wrote it in my own doc a few months back. In the git-repo I ran it before, the .git/config file contains the option. 

The command returns a nice message that made me think it worked: 

```
$ git-annex config --set annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses 10.10.10.20
annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses 10.10.10.20 ok
(recording state in git...)
```

- About the doc, I am not sure if I got the command from the man page. Maybe an example of how to set these variables with git config (`git config --add <name> <value>`) in the man page would avoid this kind of mistakes from dumb users like me ;). Maybe I thought that git-annex-config also change .git/config file.

- The ConnectionRestricted for annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses do not show-up when trying to get data from a clone of the git where the remote was configured after correctly setting that option. That is why there was no traffic out except the DNS request.

- Maybe git-annex config should not return a nice message when trying to set an unknown option. 

I will open a separate bug for the exporttree shortly.

Now it works!
Thanks for your help!
