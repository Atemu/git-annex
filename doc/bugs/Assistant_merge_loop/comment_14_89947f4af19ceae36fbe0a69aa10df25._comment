I have 3 computers syncing through a private github repo (with annex-ignore = true) and a box account for transferring files. The computers are up to date debian:testing:amd64, debian:testing:i386 and debian:sid:amd64.

I'm getting lots of empty commits with the text \"merge refs/remotes/github/synced/master\". I would really like to help in debugging this issue if possible.
