### Please describe the problem.

Git annex cannot add/import files in folders without w or x permission

Note that (as stated in the comments) this might not be a bug. The problem might somewhere within Git, because Git does not manage file permissions very well. I was just hoping that I could import large directory trees into git-annex with a simple call to "git annex import"; now it seems I have to fix their permissions first.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    $ cd /tmp
    $ mkdir -p folder/subfolder
    $ echo "some text" > folder/subfolder/some_file.txt
    $ chmod 500 folder/subfolder
    $ mkdir annex
    $ cd annex
    $ git init
    $ git annex init "Testing git annex"
    $ git annex import ../folder
    Fails
    $ chmod 600 ../folder/subfolder
    $ git annex import ../folder
    Fails
    $ chmod 700 ../folder/subfolder
    $ git annex import ../folder
    Works. Subfolder now has 755 permissions
