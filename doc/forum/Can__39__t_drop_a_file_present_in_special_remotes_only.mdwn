Hi!

I'm using git-annex version: 8.20200522-g01513da12.

A file is present in 3 special remotes (one S3 and two rsync ones). I fsck-ed all theses repositories, no problem found. Numcopies is set to 2.

Whenever I try do drop the file from one of these special remotes, I have an error message:

      Unable to lock down 1 copy of file that is required to safely drop it.
    
      (This could have happened because of a concurrent drop, or because a remote has too old a version of git-annex-shell installed.)
    
      Rather than dropping this file, try using: git annex move
    
      (Note that these git remotes have annex-ignore set: origin)

      (Use --force to override this check, or adjust numcopies.)
    failed
    git-annex: drop: 1 failed

**Do you know why I can't delete this file safely?** I don't really want to move the file from repository_s3 to my computer before dropping it from my computer, but maybe it is the only way.

Some debug here:

    git annex drop --from=repository_s3 file
