Actually I believe, the difference might just be that with an SSH remote, there is a remote process getting started on the remote that iterates over all files while with a directory remote, the iteration is done in the same process.
Now when I actually look at it, the SSH remote sync seems to take a similar amount of time to sync, it only does not output all the files it iterates over.
