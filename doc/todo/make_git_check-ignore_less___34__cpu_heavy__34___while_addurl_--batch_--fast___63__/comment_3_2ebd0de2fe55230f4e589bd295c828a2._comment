thanks Joey.  I am yet to digest though if I would like (would be safe) to avoid `git check-ignore` call in general in my use-cases.  Originally I was wondering more about some kind of \"optimization\" ;) async --batch could help indeed, we just might need to change our code to support it (have not yet looked into the code)
