This follows up to the [comment made by Laszlo](http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/polls/what_is_preventing_me_from_using_git-annex_assistant/#comment-f26d3b6b45bb66601ecfaa883ace161c) on the [recent poll](http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/polls/what_is_preventing_me_from_using_git-annex_assistant/).

I too need to be able to select the directory on the remote drive that the annex will be synced to.

If I just add a remote drive via the web app, it syncs the repository to `/mnt/usb/annex`, and it looks like it just creates a bare repository in that folder. I need the repository to be synced to something like `/mnt/usb/subfolder/myspecifiedfoldername` and I need that remote to be a full repository.

My use case is that I use the USB drive to keep annexes in sync between two computers. I have multiple annexes that need to be synced between the two computers, and none of them are in a directory called `annex`. I also need to be able to plug the drive into other computers and access the files directly, without doing a `git clone` or anything like that. I have all of this setup and working fine with just plain old git annex, but the web app does not seem to support creating new repositories with this workflow.

I think it makes a lot of sense to allow the web application to add a new remote that is simply a directory. People like me could specify the path of the directory to be on the mounted USB drive. Others may want to add a remote that is a mounted network share or something like that.
