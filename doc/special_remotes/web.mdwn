git-annex can use the WWW as a special remote, associating an url with an
annexed file, and downloading the file content from the web.
See [[tips/using_the_web_as_a_special_remote]] for usage examples.

## notes

Currently git-annex only supports downloading content from the web; 
it cannot upload to it or remove content.

This special remote uses urls on the web as the source for content.
There are several other ways http can be used to download annexed objects,
including a git remote accessible by http, S3 with a `publicurl` configured,
and the [[http]] special remote.
