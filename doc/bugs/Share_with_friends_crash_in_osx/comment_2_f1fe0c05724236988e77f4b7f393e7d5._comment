dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/libxml2.2.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOs/bundle/git-annex
  Reason: Incompatible library version: git-annex requires version 12.0.0 or later, but libxml2.2.dylib provides version 10.0.0

I think the problem at this point is I don't have brew installed though.  I'll try to do that later tonight.
