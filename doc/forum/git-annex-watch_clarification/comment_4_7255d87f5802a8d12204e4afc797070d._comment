It does not, mostly because it would need to run lsof once per file, which
would be significantly expensive. The daemon is able to batch changes and
so run lsof less often.

However, git-annex add does detect if a file is modified while it's being
hashed, and will avoid adding it then. And it prevents against most ways
the file could be modified except for if something has it open for write
beforehand. In the worst case, the object in the annex gets written to,
which later gets detected by fsck.
