git-annex add is supposed to add unlocked files. See the documentation for the unlock command on the man page. Typical workflow is to unlock a file, edit it, add the changes, and commit it.

Your example has 2 files with content \"foo\" and 1 file with content \"foobar\", which require 2 objects to be stored by git-annex, so that's what it stores.

I suggest you get a bit more familiar with git-annex before filing bugs on it.
