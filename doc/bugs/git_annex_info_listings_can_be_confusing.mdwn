### Please describe the problem.

The output of git-annex info can be confusing as the format rules change based on positioning

    repository mode: indirect
    trusted repositories: 0
    semitrusted repositories: 5
        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
        105776ba-bd78-4884-9126-aeb7c1e6da21 -- UoM Laptop
        79ff3c20-fab3-44dd-88f7-cc1a41eb73d6 -- here (UoM Desktop Client)
        949a8fc3-6334-5f5e-887d-b1e5725ea443 -- isilon (UoM Isilon Encrypted Git Backup)
        c3cec307-367b-4373-8cb9-a3da67cee745 -- home (Mac Mini Home Client)

Here we see the description surrounded in brackets and also not in brackets.  The second annex listed does not have a name (as there is no git remote configured).  Always including the brackets or an additional setting I think would make things much clearer esp. when setting things up.
