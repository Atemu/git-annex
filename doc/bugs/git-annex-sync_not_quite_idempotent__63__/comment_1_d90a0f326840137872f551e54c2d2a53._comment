sync should be idempotent as long as the remote it's syncing with is not
getting other changes made/pushed to it at the same time

There are things in your transcript that are hard to understand:

* The first sync does not have a "push origin" line, or any git output
* indicating it pushed, but it made a commit and so it would normally
  then try to push it.
* The first sync does not have a "pull origin" line
  at the beginning, but it does say 
  "Your branch is up to date"
  so it must have tried to pull from origin at the start,
  which sync always does do.
* Several other parts of the output appear to be
  in a different order than could have occurred.
  For example, the first thing sync does is "pull origin", but the
  transcript has that as the last thing output by the first sync.
* The highest bit of weirdness is that the first sync seems to pull
  commit 1d808d3a08c..de7758ca784 from github, but the second sync
  pushes 63fe6905f53..1d808d3a08c to github. Which kind of appears
  as if the two syncs have been pasted in the opposite order than they were
  run.

This makes me suspect you didn't paste the output exactly as it appeared,
and perhaps left part of it out.
