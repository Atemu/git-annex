Hi Joey,

I see that you have found the cause and a workaround for this particular
problem, but would like to point out that `chrome://net-internals/` can be
very useful for diagnosing such issues.

(I once hit the `SOCKET_POOL_STALLED_MAX_SOCKETS_PER_GROUP` problem
mentioned in
<https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=27324>, which can
cause Chromium to keep spinning while not issuing any new requests to a
specific web server.)

Cheers,  
Damien Diederen
