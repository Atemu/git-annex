git-annex doesn't \"use\" the content of files for anything, except at specific points like deriving the key. You can make it automatically copy metadata from a file into git-annex when added (see [[tips/automatically_adding_metadata]]) but it won't keep them in sync, as far as I know. Personally, I strip metadata from the images entirely and put everything into git-annex's metadata.

I would just make a script which has the behavior you want and run it when disk space is a concern  or put it in cron (gets a list of 1-star or JPGs with RAWs, passes it to `git annex drop --batch`).

Otherwise, creating a special remotes that will return `CHECKPRESENT-SUCCESS` for keys you want to drop, so you can set the preferred content to only want files that are \"not present\" in that special remote might work?
