More diagnostics on this one..

I create a file that is below the size threshold for annex, but I do have a gitlab upstream.

1) echo \"foo\" > foo  -  Assistant (or webapp) does not fire
2) git add foo -  Assistant/webapp does not fire
3) git commit -am \"random testing\"  - assistant does not fire
4) git annex sync - foo ends up in gitlab

I remove a file

1) git rm foo  - Assistant fires and file is removed from gitlab

Is this the expected behavior?  If so, why does a git rm trigger annex assistant/webapp, but a git add does not?
