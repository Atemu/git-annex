On my computer, `git annex get filename --from web` uses wget which does support
.netrc, but for some reason `git annex fsck filename --from web` does not.
Instead, I get a message that the content is missing and git annex is "fixing
location log" (slightly unrelated question, but is there any way to stop it from
doing this? Just because a URL isn't accessible now, doesn't mean it's content
is gone permanently).

I do not want to encode my credentials into the URLs (eg.
username:password@example.com) because my password changes frequently and I would
have to update all of the URLs.

	git config annex.web-options --netrc
