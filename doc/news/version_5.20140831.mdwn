   * Make --help work when not in a git repository. Closes: #[758592](http://bugs.debian.org/758592)
   * Ensure that all lock fds are close-on-exec, fixing various problems with
     them being inherited by child processes such as git commands.
   * When accessing a local remote, shut down git-cat-file processes
     afterwards, to ensure that remotes on removable media can be unmounted.
     Closes: #[758630](http://bugs.debian.org/758630)
   * Fix handing of autocorrection when running outside a git repository.
   * Fix stub git-annex test support when built without tasty.
   * Do not preserve permissions and acls when copying files from
     one local git repository to another. Timestamps are still preserved
     as long as cp --preserve=timestamps is supported. Closes: #[729757](http://bugs.debian.org/729757)"""]]
