I have ssh access to an untrusted server (i.e., data stored there should be encrypted). Should I use bup, rsync, or some other backend? Which one is faster / more stable / uses less space?

What if it was a trusted server? Is the strictly best repository format to use in that case clearly git / git-annex?
