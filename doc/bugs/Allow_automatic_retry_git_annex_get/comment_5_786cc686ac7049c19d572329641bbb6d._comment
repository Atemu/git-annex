We have annex.retry etc configuration now to control retries of transfers.

Stall detection would be good to have in git-annex. Currently, when a
transfer is stalled, the progress meter stops updating, so displays
an ETA that's wrong.

Since the progress meter is already getting called periodically when
a transfer is not stalled, a stall detector could perhaps be added
into that, to abort stalled transfers. The tricky part being that a few
types of transfers don't use the internal progress meters but rely on an
external command's progress display, and the stall detection would need to
be disabled for those. 

Hmm, a password prompt for eg ssh can also "stall"
a transfer for a long time. Perhaps the thing to do is wait until
the meter gets updated once, and only then start the stall detector.
