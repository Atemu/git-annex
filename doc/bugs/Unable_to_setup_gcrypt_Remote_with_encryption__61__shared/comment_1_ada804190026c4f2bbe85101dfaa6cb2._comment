As a workaround, I can include a \"gnupg\" Directory in the Repo and point the GNUPGHOME environment Variable at it. Then I simply create a single Key there and add the gcrypt Repo with encryption=hybrid. Altough I have to add the following to the gpg.conf (in the gnupg Directory inside the Repo) to prevent gpg from writing to the directory afterwards:
pinentry-mode loopback
no-auto-check-trustdb
no-random-seed-file
no-permission-warning
quiet
