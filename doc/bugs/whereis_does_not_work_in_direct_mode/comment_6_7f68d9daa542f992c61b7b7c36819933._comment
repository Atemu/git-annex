It looks like there might be some minor inconsistency in when git-annex syncs when in indirect mode vs direct mode. This results in the location tracking information not being committed until after the git-annex sync in the pc1/Docs repository has pushed the git-annex branch to origin. Since that is the only 
time that pc1/Docs syncs with origin, the location tracking info never reaches origin, and the rest of the behavior follows.

Here is the direct mode sync, showing the git-annex branch commit occurring after the push. Specifically, when the sync merges the git-annex branch, it also commits any deferred changes at that point:

<pre>
commit  ok
pull origin 
ok
push origin 
Counting objects: 6, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 574 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To localhost:/tmp/annex/Docs.git
 * [new branch]      git-annex -> synced/git-annex
 * [new branch]      annex/direct/master -> synced/master
ok
(Recording state in git...)
</pre>

And here is the indirect mode sync, showing a \"commit\" which includes committing deferred changes to the git-annex branch:

<pre>
commit  (Recording state in git...)
ok
pull origin 
ok
push origin 
Counting objects: 15, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (12/12), done.
Writing objects: 100% (15/15), 1.32 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 15 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To localhost:/tmp/annex/Docs.git
 * [new branch]      git-annex -> synced/git-annex
 * [new branch]      master -> synced/master
ok
</pre>

It seems that [[!commit 2cfda59174b9cbc02e87c069982096d44601cd40]] and some subsequent changes accidentially removed the Annex.Branch.commit from the direct mode code path within the first part of `sync`. So, easily fixed.
