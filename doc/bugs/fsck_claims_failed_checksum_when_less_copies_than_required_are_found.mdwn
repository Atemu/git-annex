>>>>>> I get that. Still, I think it would be _extremely_ useful to know what failures occurred, exactly. Not having enough copies is Not Good, yet not having enough copies and a locally correct file is _lot_ better than having not enough copies and a broken file. I.e. I would prefer:

    (checksum...) OK
    Not enough copies: Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies exist of foo

>>>>>> or similar and at the end

    git-annex: 0 wrong checksums
    git-annex: 11577 with too few copies

>>>>>> In the end, it comes down to the distinction of different failure classes. -- Richard
