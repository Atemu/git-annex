### Please describe the problem.
I've a repository with a prefered content of "exclude=cours/vieux/* and ( include=cours/* or include=Programmes/* or include=Stage/* )", but there is a repository that has a (identical) copy both in cours/vieux and in Stage/ so git annex sync --content will
- get the content in Stage/
- then drop it because it is in cours/vieux/

And again, and again...

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex 5.20140127 in debian/sid
