### Please describe the problem.
I am unable to run the webapp on redhat6.5

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

### Please provide any additional information below.
I am seeing the following error when running git annex webapp:

git-annex: unknown command webapp

> git-annex can be built without the webapp, and this is
> often done if a distribution does not have the full haskell stack
> packaged yet. The solution is to contact the distribution and let them
> know they need to improve it, and/or use the standalone build from this
> website.
> 
> So, please file a bug on redhat. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
