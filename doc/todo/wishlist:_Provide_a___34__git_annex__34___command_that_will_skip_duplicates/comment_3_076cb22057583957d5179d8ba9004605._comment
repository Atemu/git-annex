For what it's worth, yes, I want to actually forget I ever had the same file in the filesystem with a duplicated name. I'm not just aiming to clean up the disk's space usage; I'm also aiming to clean things up so that navigating the filesystem is easier.

I can write my own script to do that based on the symlinks' target (and I wrote something along those lines), but I still think it'd be nicer if git-annex supported this use case.

Perhaps:

<pre>git annex drop --by-contents</pre>

could let me remove a file from git-annex if the contents are available through a different name. (Right now, \"git annex drop\" requires the name *and* contents match.)
