I had to build with cabal on DragonFlyBSD because stack isn't available (which is presumably the reason it's not in dports even though it builds cleanly.)

Everything worked after, except all the cabal commands gave warnings of the type:

> Warning: The install command is a part of the legacy v1 style of cabal usage.
> 
> Please switch to using either the new project style and the new-install
command or the legacy v1-install alias as new-style projects will become the
default in the next version of cabal-install. Please file a bug if you cannot
replicate a working v1- use case with the new-style commands.

I don't know much about \"new style\" and \"legacy\" commands in cabal, but instructions should probably be cleaned up to get around these warnings at some point.
