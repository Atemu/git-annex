I made a restic repo with 2000 single-file snapshots.
Adding the first snapshot took 0.55s. Adding the 2000th
snapshot took 1.10s.

So that's a very big scalability problem with using restic with single-file
snapshots.

2000 files in a directory is not going to cause that kind of slowdown;
my guess is restic needs to load all past snapshots, or something like
that.
