I was arguing for removal of the KEY-directory/ for a while ;) See e.g. as old as https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/32 . There is an issue/discussion on this website too somewhere, couldn't find quickly.
IMHO it is just a \"tech\" problem, i.e. no design principle forbids fixing it. It might though lead to performance issues since the containing directory then needs to be chmod'ed back and forth to introduce changes to the KEY-file under it, but it is probably very similar to what it is now anyways.  

FWIW in DataLad we moved to use MD5E backend as the default to at least somewhat relief the burden of long symlinks.  I think we are \"secure\" enough for what we use DataLad here ;)
