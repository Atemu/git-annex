### Please describe the problem.
When git-annex is started using one of its start menu shortcuts (git-annex or git-annex-autostart) wscript.exe calls itself in an infinite loop. This is also described under the [section ".vbs failure" in a forum post](https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Windows_installation_notes/).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Install git and git-annex according to the [installation guide](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Windows/). Click on one of the shortcuts in the start menu.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git version 1.9.5.msysgit.1. git-annex version: 5.20150317-g237d5b0. Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit.

### Please provide any additional information below.

This seems to be fixed by editing the shortcuts and setting the "Start in" parameter to the git installation directory. For me this is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git".
