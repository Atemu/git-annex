The git-annex assistant is being
[crowd funded on Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyh/git-annex-assistant-like-dropbox-but-with-your-own/).

This is my design and plan for developing it.
Still being fleshed out, still many ideas and use cases to add.
Feel free to chip in with comments! --[[Joey]]

## the pitch

The blue sky goal would be something automated like dropbox, except fully
distributed. All files put into the repository would propagate out
to all the other clones of it, as network links allow. Note that while
dropbox allows modifying files, git-annex freezes them upon creation,
so this would not be 100% equivalent to dropbox.

## roadmap

* Month 1 "like dropbox": [[!traillink inotify]] [[!traillink syncing]]
* Month 2 "shiny webapp": [[!traillink webapp]] [[!traillink progressbars]]
* Month 3 "easy setup": [[!traillink configurators]]
* Month 4 "release": [[!traillink leftovers]]; release
* Months 5-6 "9k bonus round": [[!traillink Android]]
* In my overfunded nighmares: [[!traillink Windows]]
