### Please describe the problem.

When trying to build git-annex 5.21050113 in a clean cabal sandbox on OSX and not having wget avalible, breaks the configure step of the build. See excerpt of build log below.

I am not sure if it is a bug or not, from the debian dependencies it seems that wget is required, but from reading various pieces of the documentation it seems to only be recommended. Installing wget makes it build. 

### What steps will reproduce the problem?



### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20150113 on OSX Yosemite.

### Please provide any additional information below.
