### Please describe the problem.

When using a git remote which doesn't support git-annex (f.e. gitlab) and is configured with `annex-ignore true` the remote is shown as `unfinished repository` in the webapp.

It would be nice if the webapp would recognize this and show the remote as git-only remote including sync-state and remote name (or even better: the remote details, like the URL to the remote)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Add a normal git remote and configure `git config remote.<name>.annex-ignore true`.
Start the webapp.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
