git-annex deletes all tmp files on shutdown, if everything succeeded.
This presents 2 problems:

1. If git-annex is rsyncing something and another one is run, it will
   delete the running instance's tmp files.
2. If a long-running rsync transfer is interrupted partway through, the
   tmp file was expensive to obtain, and one needs to avoid running
   git-annex to do anything else until that transfer can be resumed and
   finished.
