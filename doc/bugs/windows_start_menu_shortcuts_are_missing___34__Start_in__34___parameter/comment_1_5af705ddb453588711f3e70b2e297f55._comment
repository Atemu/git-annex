Thanks for reporting this.

Is git in your path? (Ie, can you run git from command.exe?)

I notice that the
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/windows_start_menu_shortcuts_are_missing___34__Start_in__34___parameter/>
page, which had this problem, was a user who neglected to have git add
itself to path, contrary to what the installation instructiins say to do.

So, it's not surprising that disregarding the instructions break, but this
is a bad way for it to break. It would be better to at least avoid the
loop, and perhaps Just Work.

I don't understand why it loops.. the git-annex-webapp.vbs runs "git-annex
webapp". If git-annex is not in path (because git is not in path and it
piggybacks off git's path settings), that should fail to do anything. 
Or is Windows really sufficiently DWIM that it will search for **different
spellings** of program names?!

I don't see how I can add a "Start in" parameter; git-annex has no way of
knowing where the user intended to install git if they didn't add git to
the path.
