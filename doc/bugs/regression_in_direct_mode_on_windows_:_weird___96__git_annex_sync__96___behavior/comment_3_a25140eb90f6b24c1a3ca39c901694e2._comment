Yeah, I inverted some logic. This also affects, for example, git-annex on Android. Sigh. Sorry about this.

I suppose that, if you run into this bug, the best way to fix up after it is to `git-revert -n` the bad commit that sync made. Then run `git annex sync` with the fixed git-annex to commit the reversion.
