seems like i was wrong. i could have sworn i saw a committed file get unstaged. what i saw was:

    $ git annex status
    M file
    $ git annex undo file
    $ git annex status
    ? file

the thing is: the file was *removed* in a previous version, so i thought this was what it reverted to. i'm unsure as to why the file was marked as missing there - i ended up reverting from a backup (from another remote, by hand). after trying to reproduce this, i failed, so there may have been some PEBKAC in action again.

this feature is so useful though, thanks for this. --[[anarcat]]
