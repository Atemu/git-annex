I've added a para above.  Note that this is a wiki, and you can edit it
too!

Showing the timestamp of when the file was added to the remote could be
done; git-annex does not track the last time it verified content was on a
remote and tracking that would bloat the git-annex branch. I don't think
displaying a very old timestamp for data at rest would give the right
impression though.
