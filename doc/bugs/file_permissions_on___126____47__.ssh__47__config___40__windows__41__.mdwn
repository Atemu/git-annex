### Please describe the problem.
The log doesn't say what the webapp is running (probably ssh or similar), but it complains that ~/.ssh/config has the wrong permissions. This being cygwin, I'm not sure I can even change them; I'll poke around and see. Currently they're 0644.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Create a remote repository

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Windows 7, git-annex version 5.20131230-g192d991

### Please provide any additional information below.
I have no daemon.log, and the console log isn't particularly detailed today; it had just created an ssh key and shown it's fingerprint.
