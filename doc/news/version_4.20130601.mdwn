[[!toggleable text="""
   * XMPP: Git push over xmpp made much more robust.
   * XMPP: Avoid redundant and unncessary pushes. Note that this breaks
     compatibility with previous versions of git-annex, which will refuse
     to accept any XMPP pushes from this version.
   * XMPP: Send pings and use them to detect when contact with the server
     is lost.
   * hook special remote: Added combined hook program support.
   * Android app: Avoid using hard links to app's lib directory, which
     is sometimes on a different filesystem than the data directory.
   * Fix bug in parsing of parens in some preferred content expressions.
     This fixes the behavior of the manual mode group.
   * assistant: Work around git-cat-file's not reloading the index after files
     are staged.
   * Improve error handling when getting uuid of http remotes to auto-ignore,
     like with ssh remotes.
   * content: New command line way to view and configure a repository's
     preferred content settings.
   * sync: Fix double merge conflict resolution handling.
   * XMPP: Fix a file descriptor leak.
   * Android: Added an "Open WebApp" item to the terminal's menu.
   * Android: Work around Android devices where the `am` command doesn't work.
   * Can now restart certain long-running git processes if they crash, and
     continue working."""]]
