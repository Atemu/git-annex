Depends on how often and what \"work\" is done with the original filenames. Can you explain more what you are trying to do?

Perhaps you can use metadata/metadata views.. though this would give you the original filename as a directory, containing a file with the current filename. e.g. ~/annex/originalfilename.txt/currentfilename.txt
