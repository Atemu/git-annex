It looks like no one else has suggested this yet so I guess I'll have to: [Tox](https://tox.chat/)

Tox is pretty easy to build on all platforms (GNU/Linux, Mac and WinDOS). All the protocol relevant bits are implemented as a single C library (libtoxcore). It supports bulk file transfers and handles all the NAT hole punching nastiness internally AFAIK.

Thoughts?
