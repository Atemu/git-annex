The way that stack works is the "resolver" value in stack.yaml
points to a particular version of ghc and libraries that work with it.

I don't think that stack allows overriding the version of ghc. What you can
do is go to <http://stackage.org/> and find a snapshot that includes the
ghc version you have available, and edit stack.yaml's "resolver" to use
that. You may also need to pass --system-ghc to stack to make it use your
installed ghc rather than trying to download it.

Building with cabal, while more error prone, is another way to use whatever
version of ghc you have installed already.
