Hi joey,

It doesn't seem like embedcreds is set - `git show git-annex:remote.log | grep embed` doesn't yield anything.

The file you asked me to check does exist, and whenever I run `git annex enableremote` it gets updated with the contents of my environment variables.

I'm pretty certain the contents of these variables is correct - I'm using AWS' \"IAM\" options to allocate new access keys to my git-annex user, and would expect a different error if things were wrong there. I'll continue to double check my account settings.
