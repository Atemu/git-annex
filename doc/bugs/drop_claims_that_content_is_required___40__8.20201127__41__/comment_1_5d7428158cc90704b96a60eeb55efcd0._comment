Looks like it was caused by [[!commit d032b0885d80d12c00fa8813e88deab1631eef8a]] which made MatchingKey be used
rather than MatchingFile. Which oops, mean the filename is left relative rather
than being made into a path from the top of the repo.

Fixed that and your test case works. I do think this would be a better
expression for you to use though:

	(include=*.mrimg and exclude=*/arkistoidut/* and exclude=arkistoidut/*)

Or maybe just exclude=arkistoidut/* rather than both, depending on if you
want to support subdirectories of subdirectories with that name, or only
the single subdirectory in the top of your repo.
