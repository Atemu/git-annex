git-annex silently skips files that are not checked into git, and after you
run "mv", the file is not checked into git.

So add the file (or just use `git mv` to move it) and then it will work.

Note that, annex.skipunknown can be set to false to make git-annex not
silently skip files and instead complain. That is scheduled to become the
default in 1 year, because I know the current behavior can be confusing.
