That's not a problem at all. The repositories are identified by their UUID, so there's no danger of annex counting too many copies. Local remotes have a lower cost, so git-annex should prefer them, but you're probably going to encounter connection errors when you're not inside the LAN, so have a look at the annex-ignore-command option (see [manpage](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex)).
