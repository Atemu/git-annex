> Committing the files to a branch other than master might be a reasonable compromise. Then you can just copy the git-annex symlinks over to master as needed, or check out the branch from time to time.

I think that could work nicely. I do like the idea of having my files annexed, and distributing them across machines that way, so this strikes me as a good compromise.

Thank you for the idea!
