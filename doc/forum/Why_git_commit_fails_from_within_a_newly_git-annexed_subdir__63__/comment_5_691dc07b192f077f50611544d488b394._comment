Thanks Joey for looking into this one. I use git v2.7.4, currently shipped with Ubuntu 16.04, which may not be very recent. I don't use v6 because it is not the default in git-annex, at least till now. Should I?
I'll try the recent commit you mention, as soon as it will be available in the Linux standalone version or in Neurodebian (currently 6.20180807-g48d11a5df and 6.20180807+git230-gaa291acfe-1~ndall+1) and I will report here shortly after.
