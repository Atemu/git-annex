> If the repository being accessed over globus uses .git/annex/objects/ locations, it sounds to me like it's a git-annex repo, being accessed over a protocol other than ssh. 

That is correct.

> A special remote that accesses remote annex objects could be created, and --sameas used to make the special remote have the same uuid as the (remote) git-annex repo.

That is correct too. The question is either it should be a dedicated `git-annex-remote-globus-gitannex` special remote which would need to probably use the same functionality of a `git-annex-remote-globus` for actual authentication and interaction with globus (with difference largely in paths to assume) or just an option to the `git-annex-remote-globus`...?
