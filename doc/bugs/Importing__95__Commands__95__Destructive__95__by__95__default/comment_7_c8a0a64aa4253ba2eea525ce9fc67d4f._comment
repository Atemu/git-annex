Seems to me that the documentation of git-annex import, git-annex reinject,
and git-annex setkey is clear, that these commands all move content into the
annex.

If you don't want it to move, you can always make a copy of the file first,
and run the command on the copy. But git-annex is about managing large
files, and making a second local copy of a large file would be surprising
behavior if the user didn't explicitly ask for it.

When you set up a remote somewhere, and ask git-annex to ensure numcopies
is 2+, it is *then* eager to preserve multiple copies, because it's been
given a way to do so, and been told to. It's not eager by default though.

Given that people get confused with the existing number of options to
git-annex import, I'm reluctant to add more to it, especially if the same
behavior as the suggested options can be obtained by running `cp` first.

I still don't fully understand what your proposed options are supposed
to do..
