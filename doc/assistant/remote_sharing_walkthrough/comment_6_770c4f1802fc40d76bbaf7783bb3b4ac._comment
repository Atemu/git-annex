In your comment http://git-annex.branchable.com/assistant/remote_sharing_walkthrough/#comment-f97efe1d05c0101232684b4e4edc4866, you describe a way to synchronize two devices using an intermediate USB drive configured as a \"transfer repository\".

I understand that in that case, the USB drive can only be used as a \"transmitter\", in a git repository form, not as a copy of the files structure. This means the files contained by the USB drive cannot be accessed without git/git-annnex.

Is there a way to use the USB drive as a \"client repository\" in order to allow synchronization, as described earlier, but also as a simple copy of the files, in order to access them from any device (opening them with windows in a cyber coffee for example).

Thanks
