The OSX .dmg contains a few binaries in git-core like git-remote-http.
They have been adjusted by otool to link to libraries in the same directory
as the binary. However, the libraries are not located in the git-core
directory, but in its parent directory, and so the git-core binaries don't
link.

I don't think this is a new regression, but not entirely sure.

Seems that OSXMkLibs could symlink ../lib into git-core.
