Based on the '/linux/annex/' path, your \"linux\" git remote is set up using some sort of network mount of your Linux box to Windows. 

If that's the case, then rsync is running on Windows and probably doesn't know anything about permissions, to probably does something horrible when it's told to write a file to the linux filesystem.

If I'm right about that, I can easily fix it, by making git-annex on Windows not use rsync for such file to file copies. But I first need you to verify if I'm right about how your \"linux\" git remote is configured.

(Also, you should be able to work around the problem by changing the git remote to use a ssh:// url to the linux system.)
