git-annex makes only a best-effort attempt to preserve mtime. There are multiple cases where it cannot:

* filesystems that do not support changing the mtime of a symlink
* special remotes
* when 2 files with the same content get stored in the annex, the mtime of one must win over the other since we only have 1 inode

This last seems to be what has happened in the example you show. Both `foo` and `foobar` are empty. I'm not sure where the 01:19:41 time came from -- perhaps you had a third empty file that was not shown?

I've tested `git annex import` and it preserves mtimes otherwise.
