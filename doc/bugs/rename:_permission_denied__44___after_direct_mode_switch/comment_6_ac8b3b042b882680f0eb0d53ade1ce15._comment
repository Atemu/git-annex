I finally managed to fix my repository by using this command:

    SetFile -P -a l 2013-07-31_180411.jpg

This removes the \"locked\" attribute.  After this command, the uchg flag is no longer set and I manage to use the repository normally.

Still no idea on why it was set and whether this need a git-annex fix or not.
