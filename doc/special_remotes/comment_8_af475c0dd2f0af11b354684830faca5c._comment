Is there any chance a special remote that functions like a hybrid of 'web' and 'hook'?
At least in theory, it should be relatively simple, since it would only support 'get' and the only meaningful parameters to pass would be the URL and the output file name.

Maybe make it something like git config annex.<foo>-webhook '<program> $ANNEX_URL $ANNEX_FILE', and fetching could work by adding a --handler or --type parameter to addurl.
