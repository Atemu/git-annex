You still have git remotes configured with the uuid of the remote, so `git annex info` pulls that data in. Since --drop-dead removes all mention of the remote from the git-annex branch, including that its trust level is dead, the remaining info from the .git/config takes effect.

--drop-dead could `git remote rm` but that won't help other clones of the repo that also have the dead remote. Instead, I think it may make sense for --drop-dead to avoid removing the uuid from trust.log, so it will still know this remote is dead.

(Of course, you can easily deal with this locally by `git remote rm` yourself.)
