Someone else reported what sounds like the same bug at [[encryption_given_a_gpg_keyid_still_uses_symmetric_encryption]]. It sounds like this is somehow an agent bug. I cannot reproduce it. I can hypothesise that, if this bug is occurring, you'll be prompted for a passphrase when running this command.. which if it happens would certianly be a bug in gpg or its agent

touch foo; echo foo| gpg --symmetric --passphrase-fd=0 foo

(You can run `git annex initremote $yourremote embedcreds=yes`  and it'll modify the existing configuration.)
