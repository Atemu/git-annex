I think that annex always uses `cp --reflink=auto` for local paths (cache remote was on a local path right?).  I guess running with `--debug` could have helped to resolve the mystery ;-)

BTW -- checked locally - `reflink=auto` seems to work nicely across subvolumes of the same BTRFS filesystem. \"copying\" gigabytes takes half a second or so ;-) (without reflink=auto - takes considerably longer)
