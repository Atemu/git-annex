@frioux the webapp has a \"ssh server\" option that will set up a ssh key and use it for passwordless data transfer to a ssh server. You have to enter your password twice in the git-annex terminal app, and then it's set up.

The openssh included in the git-annex app fully supports everything you can usually do with ssh keys, so you can also set this up by hand.
