It looks to me like git-annex add is leaking a FD to
.git/annex/othertmp.lck

I ran git-annex add -J16 in a repo with 1000 files, and around half way
through it had 832 open FDs, and 737 of them were that lock file. 55 more
were pipes (to and from git cat-file etc; recent work reduced the number of
those a lot), and the remaining 37 were event and timer stuff used by the
RTS.

The number of -J does not change that leak, same number with -J2. -J2 will
open slightly less other files though.

Also, git-annex 8.20200330 does not have this problem, it seems to be a
recent bug.

[[!commit 3334130368829ad2041006560e578f1f876f68e4]] claimed to fix a leak
in this same code path.
