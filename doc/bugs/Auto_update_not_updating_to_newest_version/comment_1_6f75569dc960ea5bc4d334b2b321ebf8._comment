What version of OSX?

We can see it upgrading in the log, and 5.20131221 is consistent with this being OSX Lion, which no longer has an autobuilder, so won't be upgrading from that version unless someone steps up and makes a new autobuilder.

It seems that the wrong version got into the .info file for Lion, which probably explains the repeated upgrade attempts since it thinks a newer version is available. I've fixed that.
