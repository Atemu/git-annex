As to the "fatal: ambiguous argument" message, it happens in the same test
case w/o that global git config.

	[2020-05-05 13:28:27.204706608] read: git ["--git-dir=.git","--work-tree=.","--literal-pathspecs","log","refs/heads/master..refs/heads/synced/master","--pretty=%H","-n1"]
	fatal: ambiguous argument 'refs/heads/master..refs/heads/synced/master': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.

It's caused by sync being run with no master branch yet, and nothing to commit
to create one. refs/heads/synced/master does exist; it was synced from the
other repo. Fixed that message.
