Just released git-annex 6.20180626 with important security fixes!

Please go upgrade now, read the [[release_notes|news/security_fix_release]]
for details about some necessary behavior changes,
and if you're curious about the details of the security holes,
see [[the advisory|security/CVE-2018-10857_and_CVE-2018-10859]].

I've been dealing with these security holes for the past week and a half,
and decided to use a security embargo while fixes were being developed
due to the complexity of addressing security holes that impact both
git-annex and external special remote programs. For the full story
see past 5 posts in this devblog, which are being published all together
now that the embargo is lifted.
