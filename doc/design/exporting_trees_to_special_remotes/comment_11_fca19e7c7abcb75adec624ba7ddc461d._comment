I just wanted to throw out there, that I am playing with some stuff in the vein of this. I've been wanting to be able to export to Google Drive, but take advantage of Google Drive's api for file revisions. And I also think that being able to preserve the file structure and filenames in a special remote has a lot of uses, such as with collections exported to archive.org.

I will share my findings.
