Now I learned how to add debug messages into git-annex. And I learned that there actually already is logging infrastructure in the code.

How does one close bugs here in the wiki?

Actually I would like to assign the bug to myself with the task of finding the right place here in the wiki (or code) to document how to add debug statements. I only discovered accidentally somewhere the debugM method.
