\"I'm doubtful that this would actually let the interface be simplified\" -- I only meant that the minimum required interface would be simplified, in that git-annex could provide a default implementation of key-value remote methods in terms of the export remote interface; but any given remote could provide a more efficient implementation of these methods, overriding the default ones.

But the main benefit would be to simplify the user-facing interface: as far as the user is concerned, all special remotes could be trusted, and accessed with the same basic commands, whether configured as export or not.

\"if a S3 bucket is read-only, then an import can't re-upload.\" -- if the special remote is configured as read-only, then git-annex itself would not attempt to upload things there, no?

\"not all users are going to want export remotes to store past versions of files\" -- maybe, there could be an option to store past versions encrypted, while storing current versions plain?
