I guess what would be helpful is if you can take the current git-annex.app
and copy its files to a directory and then add in the
git-annex-turtle.app's files in a way that combines them both.
I don't currently have an OSX desktop to play with that, but if you can
show me the changes that need to be made to the file tree in git-annex.app
to merge turtle into it, I can update the build scripts.
