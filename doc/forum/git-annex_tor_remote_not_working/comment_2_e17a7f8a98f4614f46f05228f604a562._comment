I think it did indeed created (on the host) the required folder structure, and that it does contain a hostname file with the onion address inside (just checked).
Not sure what's wrong here, but i believe i didn't checked if i was using latest version of tor on both the host and server (locally, its 0.3.5.8).
didn't yet checked on the server yet as i launched a health stress check on the system, will get back to you on that one :)
