Hi,

I would like to better understand how all stages interact together in a special remote. Once a special remote is initialized, how is the PREPARE stage triggered? I could not succeed int this for now. 

Moreover, is the program continuously running after initialization? it seems to exit with an 'ok, recording state in git...'

So, if I run the program 'by hand' and talk to my special remote via VERSION,INFO,PREPARE..the remote succeeds in what it is meant to. I am having troubles in making the same happen with annex under the cover.

Thank you for your help,

Best
Giulia
