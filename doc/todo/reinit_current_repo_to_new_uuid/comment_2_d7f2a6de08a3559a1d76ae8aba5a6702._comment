>You would probably also want to run git annex fsck --fast so that any annexed content in the repo gets recorded as being present in the new uuid

This takes very long on my repo, even with `--fast`.  Maybe, there's a way to make a fast dedicated command for this scenario?  Or, a version of [[sameas|todo/support_multiple_special_remotes_with_same_uuid/]] which represents the fact that all presence info in this repo *up to this timestamp* is same as in old repo, but from that point on this repo is separate?
