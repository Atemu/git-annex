Installing such a pre-push hook by default is certianly going to break
existing workflows, so I don't see that happening. It would break my own
workflows, unless perhaps the hook only does something when the repository
is untrusted.

But I don't see anything preventing you from writing such a hook yourself.
It should be easy enough to use `git annex whereis` or something like that
to determine when you want to blick the push. If you need some additional
query facility in git-annex to write it, we can talk about that.
