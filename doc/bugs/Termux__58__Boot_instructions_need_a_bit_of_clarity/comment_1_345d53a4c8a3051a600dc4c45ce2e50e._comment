i never ran the termux:boot on my android so far. but i can tell you what i discovered about the format of ~/.config/git-annex/autostart. use the full paths... no \"~\"s. that was my failure and i wondered why git-annex assistant --autostart didnt find anything. and then one repo per line. this worked for me.
