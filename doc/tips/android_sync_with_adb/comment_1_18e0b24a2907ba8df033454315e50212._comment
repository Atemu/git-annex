>>If you want its files to not be in a subdirectory, set it to \"master\" instead.

I did that. Than I issued:

```
git annex import master --from android
```

which downloaded a lot of files

Then:
```
git annex merge android/master 
merge android/master 
merge: android/master - not something we can merge 
failed 
git-annex: merge: 1 failed
```

I tried different combinations of android/master, ./master, master/. , but all seem to fail.

plain git status shows a lot of non-added files for an \"initial commit\", and no files added. git annex status lists a lot of

```
? sdcard/bla
```

files.

Any suggestions?
