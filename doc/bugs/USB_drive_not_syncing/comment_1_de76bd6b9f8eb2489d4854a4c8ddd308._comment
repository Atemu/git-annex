You seem to have already had a regular bare git repository on the drive at `/media/A-DATA UFD/annex`, and then used the webapp or command line to make an encrypted gcrypt repository in the same location. This is the only way I can explain you being able to run \"git annex get in `/media/A-DATA UFD/annex` and it do anything at all, and it also explains the \"warning: no common commits\" and the failure to sync.

So, you have some unholy mix of two different types of repositories in one location. The best way to untangle this is probably to go into the webapp and 
in the settings menu next to that repository, choose Delete. This will get back the files that were stored in the gcrypt repository. (Or stop the assistant, and in `~/annex/` run `git annex get` to hopefully retrieve the files that it stored in the gcrypt repository, and then remove the gcrypt repository from .git/config).

You may then need to edit `/media/A-DATA UFD/annex/config` to remove the gcrypt-id setting. At that point, it should be possible to use the webapp to add the removable drive, which will see the git repository on there and use it.

I have re-tested that the webapp does not allow creating a gcrypt repository when a regular bare git repository already exists on a removable drive. IIRC there were some bugs in this area initially, but they've all been fixed for a while. It *is* possible to manually use `git annex initremote` at the command line to turn a regular bare git repository into a gcrypt repository.
