right now I am driving myself crazy trying to understand why I have objects that *nothing is pointing to*, yet git annex unused fails to report them. these objects report 1 hardlink and they are from a migrated backend. I'll try git annex forget, but I really don't understand what is keeping these objects from being reported as unused.
