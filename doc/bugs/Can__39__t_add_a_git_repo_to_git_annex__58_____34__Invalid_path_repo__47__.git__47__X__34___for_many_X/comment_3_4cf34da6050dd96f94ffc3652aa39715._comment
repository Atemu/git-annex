Well, git-annex is all about working around *1* limitation of git. There are several other limitations that it would be nice to have tools to deal with better, including storing metadata, and this one. I can't take everything on.

I mostly worry about these limitations in the context of naive users using the git-annex assistant for file sync. I have heard that some people put their git repositories in dropbox.

You don't sound at all naive, so I'll suggest another tool I wrote, mr <http://joeyh.name/code/mr>. With mr you can run a single command and operate on all repositories at or under a directory.
