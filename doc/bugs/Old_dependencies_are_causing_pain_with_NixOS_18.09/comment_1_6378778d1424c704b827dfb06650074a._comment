I'd kind of like to switch to using the Amazonka package for S3;
it may be better maintained and there are several modern S3 features
that the haskell aws library is lacking support for.
Patches in that direction would be great.

But I see that this is actually a conflict between dependencies of aws and
equelito, so [[todo/Retire_Esqueleto_as_a_dependency]] would fix the
immediate problem.

(I've been doing some work to keep aws current with new versions of its
dependencies, eg 
https://github.com/aristidb/aws/commit/6fa37706d13133d0b5c406bca2f304d1e567d028
since it's otherwise been lagging with such updates.)
