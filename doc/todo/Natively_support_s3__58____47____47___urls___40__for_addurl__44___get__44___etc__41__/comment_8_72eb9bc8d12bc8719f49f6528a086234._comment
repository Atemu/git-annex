@Ilya_Shlyakhter it is possible for git-annex to send things to S3 though,
particularly `git-annex export` sounds like it may meet your use case.
(Or the planned [[todo/import_tree]].)

Remote url claiming iterates through remotes ordered by cost, so the
cheapest remote wins. I'm not decided if that really makes sense, it's
just what fell out of the code.

As to s3:// stealthily hiding the fact that what look like real urls are
forced to be hosted by Amazon -- ugh. Amazon may not want S3 to be a
protocol, but it is one, and so that is inappropriate hard-coding.
