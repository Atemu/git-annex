Here is the result of running `echo Foo > ~/Desktop/annex/dagon2.txt` on dagon.

In dagon's daemon.log:
<pre>
add dagon2.txt (checksum...) (Recording state in git...)
(Recording state in git...)
Already up-to-date.

Nothing appeared in zakaz's log. As I mentioned in the previous comment hastur doesn't seem to have a log (should this worry me?).

The new file appeared on dagon and hastur but not zakaz (not even as a broken link).

I tried a couple more times (dagon3 and dagon4) with the same effect.

Since zakaz now appears to be the host which is playing up I then tried `echo Foo > zakaz2.2txt` on zakaz.

The log on zakaz said:
<pre>
add zakaz2.2txt (checksum...) gpg: cannot open tty `/dev/tty': No such device or address
gpg: cannot open tty `/dev/tty': No such device or address

gpg: cannot open tty `/dev/tty': No such device or address

and dagon:

However zakaz2.2txt is a broken symlink on both hastur and dagon.
