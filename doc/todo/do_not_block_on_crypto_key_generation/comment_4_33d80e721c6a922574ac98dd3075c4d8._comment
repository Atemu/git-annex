I'm sorry, I misunderstood this comment:

> git-annex intentially makes the same default choices that gnupg does about random quality

I thought you were saying you replicated gnupg's policy decisions but now I understand you delegate those to GnuPG which seems like a reasonable choice! And hopefully this will all be fixed when GnuPG is fixed.

Sorry for the trouble... :/
