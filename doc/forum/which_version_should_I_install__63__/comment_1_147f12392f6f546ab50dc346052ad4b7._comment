There is a changelog at [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/git-annex-8.20200309/changelog).

v6 is very old.  v8 includes speed improvements; downside is it's new so less tested by users, upside is that bugfixes are more likely to happen for it than for legacy versions, and that you avoid an eventual [[git-annex-upgrade]].  I'd probably install v8.
