Sorry for the noise - it turned out the local annex repository somehow had been marked as \"dead\" (as shown by git status).

The fix was simply to git annex semitrust <repo uuid> and it went back to life.

I am not sure how this bug tracker works, but this bug report can be closed as invalid. Thanks for git annex!
