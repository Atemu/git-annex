Prompting users about things rarely improves security.
(Not saying it doesn't in the case of emacs org mode, which may be a
special case.) A good way to make clear to a user that they are running
code that comes from a git repository is to make them take the effort to
run ./setup or something like that.

It would also be weird for git-annex to prompt for this, since it never
prompts about anything else, and auto-enabling these special remotes could
happen when running any git-annex command.
