### Please describe the problem.

When creating a new remote with the webapp (on Windows) and setting the remote repository directory as "~/wherever", everything seems to be going well up until pressing the button to create an unencrypted repository. There is no output from either the terminal or error messages displayed in the browser.

On the remote server, it turns out that it is creating a directory named ~ within $HOME so that there is a $HOME/~/wherever directory.

Omitting the leading ~/ correctly creates $HOME/wherever and the setup proceeds as it should.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Try to create a remote repository with directory "~/wherever".

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

OS: Windows 7
