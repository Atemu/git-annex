If I could reproduce the remaining failure, what I'd do is run git-annex test 
with --keep-failures, and then after it fails and prints out the test repo
it failed in, go in there and try running the `git annex copy --from` or
other command that appears to be failing, see how it's failing, and take it
from there.
