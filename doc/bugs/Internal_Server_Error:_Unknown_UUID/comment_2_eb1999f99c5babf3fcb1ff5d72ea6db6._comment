I got the same problem (Mac OS X 10.8.4, whatever the latest download package, local computers same network repos)

To get rid of the noname repo, I just removed git remote in the annex dir.

    # List remote
    $ git remote -v
    # Remove remote grabbed from running the previous command
    $ git remote rm your_remote

After that, I added the second computer repo successfully.
