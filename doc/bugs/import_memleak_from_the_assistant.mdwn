### Please describe the problem.
Git annex daemon are memleaking abundantly thus making it unusable for a long period of time. It is currently taking 38.8% of my available ram (8go) and has been launched arround 14h today.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
The assistant has been launched using "git annex assistant" on a repository
created by the Webapp (the Webapp wasn't running at that time).

If I simply launch the Webapp, I've got the same result of memleaking.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 5.20131213
build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP Feeds Quvi TDFA
key/value backends: SHA256E SHA1E SHA512E SHA224E SHA384E SHA256 SHA1 SHA512 SHA224 SHA384 WORM URL
remote types: git gcrypt S3 bup directory rsync web webdav glacier hook

On Ubuntu LTS using the ppa.

### Please provide any additional information below.
This daemon.log come from a very fast moving repository but this also happen on other way slower moving repositories.

# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log
