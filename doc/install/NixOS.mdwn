Users of the [Nix package manager](http://nixos.org/) can install it by running:

    nix-env -i git-annex

When including it in a NixOS configuration.nix file, the name of the reference to the package is

    haskellPackages.gitAnnex

The build status of the package within Nix can be seen on the [Hydra Build
Farm](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixpkgs/trunk/gitAndTools.gitAnnex).

----

If git-annex is installed using Nix on a non-NixOS system, note that
git-annex-shell will not be available in PATH if git-annex tries to ssh
into the system and run it. This is because bash is typically built
without the flag `-DSSH_SOURCE_BASHRC`, and so the .bashrc that sets up the
PATH to include Nix-installed packages is not read.

This is not a problem when using NixOS, because it does build bash with
that flag. Nor is this a problem when using git-annex locally.
But, if you're setting up a server that will be used as a git
remote, you'll need to find a way to get git-annex-shell
into the PATH, or otherwise deal with this.

Another way to deal with the problem is to find the location where
git-annex-shell is installed on the remote system, and configure the git
remote for that system to use that location, by setting
`remote.<name>.annex-shell` in its git configuration.
