Worth noting that `git annex import /dir` also does not use CoW. However,
since that part of the import interface is desired to be replaced with
importing from a special remote, I'm inclined not to go the extra mile for
CoW there.

I think I'll be able to implement the Cow before you have to workaround
again, yarik.
