Are you seeing libkqueue crash when it's called from a debugger or C program, rather than from Haskell?

Are you building for 32 or 64 bit? You might try getting the 32 bit version of GCC (or The Haskell Platform) and see if it does better. There is a known GCC crashes on 64 bit OSX involving C libraries,
although this bug report doesn't seem to apply, since we're not using ghci <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7040>.

Are you building with cabal, or using the Makefile?

You might try reverting git commit da4c506d61115236f3e43dd0bd17f30cd54df950

You might try disabling the -threaded option in the cabal file or Makefile.

I ssh'd to the OSX box I have an account on, and confirmed that git-annex watch still works there as of the current head of the `assistant` branch. That's a 64 bit GHC system, FWIW.

Do you see the crash when building from the `master` branch, or only `assistant`? Master has the watch command, but it's much out of date, so this will tell if the problem was introduced recently... and you might still have to bisect it since I can't reproduce it. :(
