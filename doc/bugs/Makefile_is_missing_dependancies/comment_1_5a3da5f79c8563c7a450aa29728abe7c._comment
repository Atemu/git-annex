Just did some minor digging around and checking, this seems to satisfy the compilers etc... I have yet to confirm that it *really* is working as expected. Also it might be better to check for a darwin operating system instead of apple I think, though I don't know of any one really using a pure darwin OS. But for now it works (I think)

Subject: [PATCH] Define (__APPLE__) in StatFS

At least on OSX 10.6.6 it appears to have the same defintions as
FreeBSD. The build process doesn't complain and the code is enabled,
this needs to be tested and checked more.
