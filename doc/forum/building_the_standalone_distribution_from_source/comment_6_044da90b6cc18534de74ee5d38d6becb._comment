I had no idea git-annex was on a conda channel even though it is clearly stated on the [install page](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/).

I just installed it with `conda install git-annex -c conda-forge` and, to my amazement, instead of `v8.20200226` (which was available on my focal fossa standard apt repos) being installed, `v8.20200810-g693f2093a` was installed.

It was so easy to install and it is a version that was built just yesterday. I loved it.

Please keep the plumbing that made this possible alive.
