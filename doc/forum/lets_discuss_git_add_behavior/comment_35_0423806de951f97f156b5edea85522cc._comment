I started using git-annex for the first time today and ran head-first into this bug, so I'm glad to see a course correction here.  I just wish the update had been done a month earlier, as the version packaged with Fedora 30 has the 'git add' override behavior which cost me a few hours in figuring out how to get files out of the annex and into a git object.  The git-annex-add wiki page really could use a couple warnings to say that 'git add' may be overridden and that in earlier v7 revisions you are basically required to use annex.largefiles with a strict filter in order to make normal use of 'git add'.
