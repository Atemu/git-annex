I've implemented annex.dotfiles in the `v8` branch.

I did not tie it to annex.largefiles in the end, spwhitton is right.

`git-annex add` behavior around dotfiles did change in a potentially
surprising way, since dotfiles are assumed to be non-large, they get added
to git. Users who have dotfiles that are large (or dotdirs containing large
files) will need to configure annex.largefiles and annex.dotfiles to avoid
those files being added to git. But, I don't think that will affect many
users, and it avoided a lot of complexity. At least such users can use this
and other semi-recent git-annex configs to avoid `git add` adding their
large dotfiles directly to git.
