If I want to replace a locked file with new content, rather than edit the existing content, is it ok to skip the [[`git-annex-unlock`|git-annex-unlock]]/[[`git-annex-lock`|git-annex-lock]] steps?  If I just remove the symlink to the annex, create a new regular file in its place, then [[`git-annex-add`|git-annex-add]] the new file and commit, things seem to work fine.   Does this create some inconsistency that can come back to bite me later, or is this supported usage?
