# NAME

git-annex lookupkey - looks up key used for file

# SYNOPSIS

git annex lookupkey `[file ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command looks up the key used for a file in the
index. The key is output to stdout. If there is no key (because
the file is not present in the index, or is not a git-annex managed file),
nothing is output, and it exits nonzero.
