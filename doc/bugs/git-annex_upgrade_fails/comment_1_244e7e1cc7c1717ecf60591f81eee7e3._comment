git status exiting with -9 means it died of SIGKILL.
The only thing I can think of that could have killed it is the OOM killer.

Based on your apt config, I guess git was probably older than version 2.23,
so it would have the [[bug that makes git status use a lot of memory|v7_unlock_big_file__58___out_of_memory]].

It appears that the v5 repository was a direct mode repository.

What I suggest you do to recover is, upgrade git to 2.23, and re-run
git-annex upgrade. It should pick up where it left off.
