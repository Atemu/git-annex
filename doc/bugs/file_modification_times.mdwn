### Please describe the problem.
The files created in another remote when syncing is "now" rather than keeping the modification time of the source file. As such, git-annex assistant is removing an important bit of information about the file.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1) create two repositories in your computer using webapp
2) add files to RepoA, see that they are synced to the RepoB.
3) check the file modification times from any file manager. you will see that while files in RepoA carry correct modification time, synced file in RepoB carries current time.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Ubuntu 13.10 32bit version 4.20130815 from apt-get.
