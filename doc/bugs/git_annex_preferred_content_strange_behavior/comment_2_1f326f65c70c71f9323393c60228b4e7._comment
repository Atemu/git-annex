On closer thoughtk the behavior with no preferred content set, 
of copy --auto not copying anything is actually the desired behavior.
Since --auto also checks numcopies, when no preferred content is set
it should only want to copy files if needed to satisfy numcopies.

So, the wrong behavior is when it suddently starts copying everything,
indeed.
