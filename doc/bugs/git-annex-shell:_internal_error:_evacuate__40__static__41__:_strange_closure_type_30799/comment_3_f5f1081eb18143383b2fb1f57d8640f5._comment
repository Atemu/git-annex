Repeated bisect with -j1, just to be sure it's not a random error, and it gave me 828a84ba3341d4b7a84292d8b9002a8095dd2382 again.
Guess I'll look through the changes there a bit later and try to revert these until it works.

Not sure if it's repeatable by anyone but me  (and hence worth fixing), but here's a bit more of info about the system:

(some stuff listed here as ::installed, but contains no files, since these packages detect whether ghc-7.0.2 already comes with the same/newer package version)
