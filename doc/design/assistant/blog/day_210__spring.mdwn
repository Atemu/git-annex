Trying to record screencasts demoing the assistant is really helping me
see things that need to be fixed.

Got the version of the haskell TLS library in Debian fixed, backporting
some changes to fix a botched security fix that made it reject all
certificates. So WebDAV special remotes will work again on the next release.

Fixed some more problems around content being dropped when files are
moved to archive directories, and gotten again when files are
moved out.

Fixed some problems around USB drives. One was a real jaw-dropping
bug: "git annex drop --from usbdrive" when the drive was not
connected still updated the location log to indicate it did not have
the file anymore! (Thank goodness for fsck..)
