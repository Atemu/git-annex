The webapp is a web server that displays a shiny interface.

## security

* Listen only to localhost. **done**
* Instruct the user's web browser to open an url that contains a secret
  token. This guards against other users on the same system. **done**
  (I would like to avoid passwords or other authentication methods,
  it's your local system.)
* Don't pass the url with secret token directly to the web browser,
  as that exposes it to `ps`. Instead, write a html file only the user can read,
  that redirects to the webapp. **done**
* Alternative for Linux at least would be to write a small program using
  GTK+ Webkit, that runs the webapp, and can know what user ran it, avoiding
  needing authentication.

## interface

* list of files uploading and downloading **done**
* progress bars for each file
* drag and drop to reorder
* cancel and pause
* button to open file browser on repo (`xdg-open $DIR`)
* keep it usable w/o javascript, and accessible to blind, etc

## other features

* there could be a UI to export a file, which would make it be served up
  over http by the web app
* Display any relevant warning messages. One is the `inotify max_user_watches`
  exceeded message.
* possibly add a desktop file to the top of the repository that can be used
  to open the webapp (rather than using the menus). Would be complicated
  some by the path to git-annex sometimes needing to be hardcoded and varying
  across systems, so it would need to be a symlink to `.git/annex/desktop`
  which would be per-system.

## first start

* make git repo **done**
* generate a nice description like "joey@hostname Desktop/annex"
* record repository that was made, and use it next time run
* write a pid file, to prevent more than one first-start process running
  at once

## implementation

* possibly lose the ugly auth= token past the first page,
  and use a client-side session. It could be encrypted using the token
  as the `encryptKey`. Note: Would need to set the session duration
  to infinite (how?)
