Hi,

I'm trying to build from source on Mavericks. brew works fine, but when trying to build gnuidn I get

$ cabal install gnuidn
Resolving dependencies...
Configuring gnuidn-0.2...
cabal: The pkg-config package libidn is required but it could not be found.
Failed to install gnuidn-0.2
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
gnuidn-0.2 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1

Any idea why libidn cannot be found?
