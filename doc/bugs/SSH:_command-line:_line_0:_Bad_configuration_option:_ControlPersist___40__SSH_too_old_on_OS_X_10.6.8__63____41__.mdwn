What steps will reproduce the problem?

Try to get any file from a remote ssh repository on OS X 10.6.8

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Instead of retrieving the files, I get:

    % git annex get . 
    get <filename> command-line: line 0: Bad configuration option: ControlPersist
    command-line: line 0: Bad configuration option: ControlPersist
    (not available) 
      Try making some of these repositories available:
      	2efd46d2-0e32-11e2-95fe-f72f09c6615e -- office

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
     % git annex version
    git-annex version: 3.20120925
    local repository version: 3
    default repository version: 3
    supported repository versions: 3
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2

I seems that this option is passed to SSH, but SSH is too old: OpenSSH_5.2p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb
