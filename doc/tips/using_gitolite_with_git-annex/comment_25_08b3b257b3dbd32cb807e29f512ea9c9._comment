Hi. Does anyone knows where does gitolite stores the annex objects' contents? (I got it to work, and git annex is working fine, but I want to \"see the annex files\" in the central gitolite server. And it puzzles me I can't find them! It definitively is not in the repo.git bare repository under the gitolite admin repositores folder)
