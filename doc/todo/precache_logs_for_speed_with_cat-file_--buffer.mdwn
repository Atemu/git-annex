Like --all was sped up 2x-16x in 
[[!commit d010ab04be5a8d74fe85a2fa27a853784d1f9009]], commands
that ls-files the worktree may be sped up by using cat-file --buffer
to get location logs (and maybe other logs) more efficiently,
and precache them.

Unlike --all, each file's blob will need to be itself catted with cat-file
to find the key, before passing that to cat-file --buffer. Currently that's
done later by lookupFile, so things like withFilesInGit will need to be
changed to pass the Key along. 

Probably that extra round trip means the performance improvement will not
be as good as --all's was, but it could still be significant.
