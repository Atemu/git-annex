Does this only happen when the directory is on the network share, or also
on a local disk?

Does the .git/hooks directory exist? What happens if you mkdir that
directory and then re-run git-annex init?

This does not seem to happen on windows generally, and git-annex creates
the directory if it does not exist, so failing this way is surprising.
