Since I tested this release in a clean system, I suspect you have a ~/.ghc and ~/.cabal with something installed that is causing this dependency problem for you. 

<pre>
# rm -rf .ghc .cabal
# cabal update
Config file path source is default config file.
Config file /root/.cabal/config not found.
Writing default configuration to /root/.cabal/config
Downloading the latest package list from hackage.haskell.org
# cabal install git-annex
