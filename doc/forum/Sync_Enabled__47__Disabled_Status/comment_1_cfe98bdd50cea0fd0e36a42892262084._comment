The webapp is changing the git configuration 
"remote.<name>.annex-sync" to false to disable and back to true to enable.

You can use `git config` to change that yourself. 

However, if you have the assistant running in the background and make such
a git configuration change, it won't notice the change, and will keep
running with the old configuration. So you'll want to restart it by running
`git annex assistant --stop; git annex assistant`
