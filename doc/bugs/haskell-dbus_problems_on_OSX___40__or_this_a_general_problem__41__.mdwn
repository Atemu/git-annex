cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
dbus-0.10 failed during the building phase. The exception was:

git-annex-3.20120721 depends on dbus-0.10 which failed to install.

The above isn't a git-annex problem but a dbus problem, at first I thought I didn't have the network package installed, but did. I should probably report this problem to the haskell dbus author.

On a slightly different note, based on the makefile DBUS is not enabled on OSX/BSD so I did not expect the cabal file to use dbus as well, I'm currently interested in poking at the webapp stuff ;)

Although DBUS is available on OSX from macports I get the feeling that the haskell-dbus package might need some poking before it works properly.

To continue, pulling, installing the dependancies (dbus is still boned) and building commit 6cecc26206c4a539999b04664136c6f785211a41
