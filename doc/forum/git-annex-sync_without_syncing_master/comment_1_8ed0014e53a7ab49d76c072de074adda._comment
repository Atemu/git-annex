If I am not mistaken, you need to:

1) manually fetch `git-annex` from everywhere,

2) not have the `synced/master` branch (or it should be an ancestor of `master`),

3) use [[git-annex-merge]] or `git annex sync --no-pull --no-push` (maybe just `--no-pull` is enough),

4) manually push `git-annex` back to every other repository.

Other remarks:

- You can use `git annex sync --cleanup` to delete all `synced/*` branches.
- Or you can check out another branch and run `git annex sync` â€” it will fetch all branches, but merge only the current.
- I don't fully understand how `synced/git-annex` works, so maybe the real answer is more complex.
