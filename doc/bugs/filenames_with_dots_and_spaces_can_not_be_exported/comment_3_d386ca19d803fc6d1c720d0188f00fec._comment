Converted the storeKey method to throw exceptions. This was a 1000 line
patch, 3 hours of work. Seems likely it will take 24 hours work to finish
converting all the methods..

There were quite a few places where it used to return False without
displaying a reason for the failure, so the work seems worth it.
