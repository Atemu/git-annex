Confirmed this bug. This feels like it should trigger a release, as it
could break existing workflows in a surprising way, and even maybe result
in data loss if the user was relying on git-annex embedding the creds and
didn't otherwise have a way to get them.

It's (yet another) regression caused by 7.20200202.7's sweeping changes to
remote configuration.

Problem is, there's a externalConfigChanges that SETCONFIG
updates, but SETCREDS does not, instead it swap in a new externalConfig.
But that externalConfig is not examined when extracting the config changes
to store in remote.log, because the types don't match up any longer.

So, SETCREDS needs to also update externalConfigChanges.

Related regression: When SETCONFIG is used, followed by GETCONFIG
of the same value, it does not return the value. This doesn't affect
SETCONFIG at init time followed by GETCONFIG later, so it's unlikely to
affect anything, but it's still wrong, and so I've fixed it.

And they don't stop coming, yet another regression: Not setting embedcreds
was treated as embedcreds=no, because the bool parser defaulted to False.
So the implicit embedcreds when using encryption=pubkey broke.
