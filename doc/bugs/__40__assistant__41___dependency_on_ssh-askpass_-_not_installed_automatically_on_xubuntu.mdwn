### Please describe the problem.
Using assistant via xfce's "Internet -> Git annex" menu item, trying to connect to an ssh server fails

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Use xubuntu 13.04 and git-annex

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 3.20121112ubuntu2

xubuntu 13.04

### Please provide any additional information below.
if I "sudo apt-get install ssh-askpass", this gets resolved. I think this should be fixed in the ubuntu repository's program dependencies.

Also if I run "git-annex webapp" from the terminal, this doesn't happen because it will ask me for the password in the terminal.
[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log
 Failed to ssh to the server.
