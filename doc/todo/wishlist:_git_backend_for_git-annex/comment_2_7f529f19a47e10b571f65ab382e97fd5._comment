On the plus side, the past me wanted exactly what I had in mind.

On the meh side, I really forgot about this conversation :/

When you say this todo is not a priority, does that mean there's no ETA at all and that it will most likely sleep for a long time? Or the almost usual \"what the heck, I will just wizard it up in two lines of haskell\"?
