Doesn't say anything to me..

Using nohup might help, or at least get us an error message to see. Edit `git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex-webapp` and make the last line:

<pre>
nohup \"$base/runshell\" git-annex webapp \"$@\"
</pre>

It'll put a nohup.out log file in your home directory, or somewhere like that.
