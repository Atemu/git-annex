Since you're trying to use the mimetype feature, have you checked that
your git-annex is built with support for it? Run `git annex version` and
check for "MagicMime" in the build flags.

Indeed, I'm possitive that's the problem with your build, since the stack
build disables this feature by default. Because it needs libmagic to be
installed, and stack can't install such C libraries and to get a stack
build that works everywhere, it has to be disabled by default.

So the solution for you is to tell stack to build with the MagicMime build
flag.

Remaining question is, why is git-annex not displaying an error in this
situation?  I tried to replicate it, and it seems to display a nice
error message here:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/tt>git add bash
	git-annex: bad annex.largefiles configuration: Parse failure: "mimetype" not supported; not built with MagicMime support
	error: external filter git-annex smudge --clean %f failed 1
	error: external filter git-annex smudge --clean %f failed
