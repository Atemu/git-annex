A handy alternative to the default [[backend|backends]] is the
SHA1 backend. This backend provides more git-style assurance that your data
has not been damaged. And the checksum means that when you add the same
content to the annex twice, only one copy need be stored in the backend.

The only reason it's not the default is that it needs to checksum
files when they're added to the annex, and this can slow things down
significantly for really big files. To make SHA1 the default, just
add something like this to `.gitattributes`:

	* annex.backend=SHA1
