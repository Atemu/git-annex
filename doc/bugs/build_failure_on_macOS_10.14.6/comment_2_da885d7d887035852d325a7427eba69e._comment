Thank you for maintaining the homebrew build, and for tracking down the
persistent version.

I've fixed this now, and will be making a new git-annex release today.

FWIW, git-annex.cabal intentionally doesn't pin higher bounds of library
versions. My thinking is that people who want a build pinned at known
working versions should use stack to build, while people who are building
with cabal tend to be the kind of people who are integrating git-annex with
a larger system, and will probably want to build with whatever library
versions shipped with their system (eg in a linux distribution), or
with the latest and greatest.

That does mean that everyone building with cabal is likely to run into this
kind of breakage now and then, rather than me not noticing it until I update
the pinned versions. Kind of offloading a bit of the work from me onto users,
I have to admit.

You can of course patch git-annex.cabal to use an older version if
necessary.
