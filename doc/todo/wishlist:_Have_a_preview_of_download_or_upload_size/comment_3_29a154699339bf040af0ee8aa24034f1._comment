What do you think of the following simpler variant:

    % git annex size myfile1.zip
    myfile1.zip is 1329 MB
    % git annex size mydir/
    mydir contains 2803 files totaling 328 GB.

If you're worried about running over the tree twice, it may be a good idea to store the size of a subtree along with the other metadata.
