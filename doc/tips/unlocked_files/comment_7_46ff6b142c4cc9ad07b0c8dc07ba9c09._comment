On the doc it's said that

\"Note that setting annex.thin only has any effect on systems that support hard links. It is supported on Windows, but not on FAT filesystems.\"

Having read that, I was thinking that I'd be able to use _annex.thin_ with NTFS but it doesn't work. 
I'd specify clearly that NTFS would also not work with _annex.thin_

Thanks
