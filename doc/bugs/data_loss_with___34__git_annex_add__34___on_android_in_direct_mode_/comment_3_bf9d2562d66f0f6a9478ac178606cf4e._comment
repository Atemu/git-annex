The truely odd thing about this is that when git-annex adds a direct mode file, it does *not* touch the file at all. The file is left right where it is.

This is even the case if two files have the same SHA checksum. I have just verified that even in this case; neither file is touched in any way by `git annex add`.

(Obviously, I never saw anything like this when working with git-annex on Android. I hope this is not some evil April Fools prank.)
