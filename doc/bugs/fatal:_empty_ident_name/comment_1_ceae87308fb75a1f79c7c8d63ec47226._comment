This is an error message from git. [Git faq](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Git_commit_is_dying_telling_me_.22fatal:_empty_ident_.3Cuser.40myhost.3E_not_allowed.22.2C_what.27s_wrong.3F). I don't understand why git is doing it given the configuration shown, but I suppose it would do the same thing if you run git commit by hand.
