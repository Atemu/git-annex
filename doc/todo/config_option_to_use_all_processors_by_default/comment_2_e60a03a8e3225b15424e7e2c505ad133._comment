Just to be clear, not rejecting the idea of -J ncupus out of hand, but I
think it needs some UI consideration. If it were implemented as -J0 (or -J
but I don't think optparse-applicative currently supports -J optionally
lacking a parameter), we might regret it if a better way to determine
a good level of concurrency is later found.

Wanting to run one (or two) concurrent operations per remote is something
that comes to mind as perhaps better in many situations.

Or I can imagine dynamically adjusting concurrency to
optimise throughput. Although I don't know how I'd implement that.
