### Please describe the problem.

Creating a remote S3 repository using the git-annex assistant web interface fails with a GPG error.  (I'm also getting a GPG error trying to create a USB repo but it's slightly different so I'll post a different bug.)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

  * Build git-annex and git-annex assistant using the instructions at https://gist.github.com/calmyournerves/7144127
  * Run git-annex app to launch web interface
  * Create local repo using web interface
  * Try to create encrypted S3 remote repo using web interface

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version 4.20131105-g136b030 on MacOS 10.9 Mavericks.

### Please provide any additional information below.
