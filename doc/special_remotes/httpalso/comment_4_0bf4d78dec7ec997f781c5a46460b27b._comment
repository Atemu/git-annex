@tomdhunt I think it could probably be used with a git remote that exported
its .git files over http, but since git-annex supports using such a remote
as a normmal git remote, there does not seem to be any point in using it
that way.

http authentication is not currently supported, I suppose it could be added
if useful, file a [[todo]] if you have a use case.
