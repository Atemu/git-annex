annex-speculate-present is a boolean setting, I see that the docs didn't
make that clear and have improved them.

I don't see any value in speculating that urls are present in some specific
remote; there's already sufficient support for remotes to register and
claim urls. 

See CLAIMURL in the external special remote protocol.
The ipfs special remote is an example of a a remote that uses CLAIMURL to
add support for a new type of url to git-annex.
