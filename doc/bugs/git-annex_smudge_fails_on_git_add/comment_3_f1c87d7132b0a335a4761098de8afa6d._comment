Hmm, so it is enabled.

So, I guess that the attempt to use the magic database is somehow failing.
Apparently in a way that doesn't cause git-annex to display a useful error
message.

Can you check what is the behavior if you run:

	git-annex smudge --clean file < file

That is supposed to output something on stdout, and exit successfuly.
I guess it's probably exiting nonzero, and any output would be helpful to
know.

It may also be helpful to strace that command.
