	# git commit -m moved

You can use any normal git operations to move files around, or even
make copies or delete them.

Notice that, since annexed files are represented by symlinks,
the symlink will break when the file is moved into a subdirectory.
But, git-annex will fix this up for you when you commit --
it has a pre-commit hook that watches for and corrects broken symlinks.

## Direct mode

Note that these git commands only work when git-annex is using indirect mode. Repositories created by the [[assistant]] are in [[direct_mode]]. Running 'git mv' in direct mode will give you an error:

    fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree
