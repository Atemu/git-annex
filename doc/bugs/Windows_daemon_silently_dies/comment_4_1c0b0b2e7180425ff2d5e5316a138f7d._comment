Hmm, there are two places where the assistant happens to hard code a 10 minute time period. But one is 10 minutes from starting to configure a ssh remote in the webapp, not from start. And the other is the watcher's afterLastDaemonRun check, which only happens when a symlink appears in the repository (which shouldn't happen on windows and wouldn't necessarily happen 10 minutes after start).

Fabulous .. I just reproduced the crash!
