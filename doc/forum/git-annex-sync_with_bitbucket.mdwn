When doing `git-annex-sync` with a [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repository, I get the errors:

>(master_env_v17) /web/personal/ilya > git annex sync
>
>Failed to get annex.uuid configuration of repository origin
>
>Instead, got: "logged in as notestaff\n\nYou can use git or hg to connect to Bitbucket. Shell access is disabled\n"
>
>This is unexpected; please check the network transport!

What is the right way to fix this?  Thanks!
