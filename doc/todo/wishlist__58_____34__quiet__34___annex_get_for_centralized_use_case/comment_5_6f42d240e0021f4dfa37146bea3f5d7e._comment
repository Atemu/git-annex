Wow.  This worked better than expected.  I'm still trying to understand the implementation (I'm not familiar with Haskell), but there is some magic going on.

To explain:

I didn't expect that when I added a file (Locally and to the annex remote) that when somebody else did a pull, git-annex would recognize this and update the working copy to download and include that file.

I'm not sure if this is intended behavior or not (since I thought all commands had to go through git-annex) but I like it nonetheless.

Thanks again for the tips!
