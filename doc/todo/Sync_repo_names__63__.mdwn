It's very confusing to me that the same repo viewed from different client systems can have different names and descriptions.  This implies that making changes to a remote repo from one system only affects how that system sees the repo, but it seems to affect how the entire git-annex "pair" or "network of repos" sees it.

I think it would be good if the names and descriptions of repos were synced across clients.
