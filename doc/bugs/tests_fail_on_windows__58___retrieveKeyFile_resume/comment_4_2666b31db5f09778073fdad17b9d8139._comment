Problem is confirmed to not be from the 33% test, the 0% test failed when
run before it, also in the removeAnnex part. And removeAnnex didn't change
lately, so it seems probably an earlier test sets up the failure.

I've moved the 0% test to be the first test that retrieves the file, let's
see if it succeeds that way, and if so, it must be that retrieveKeyFile is
leaking a file handle, despite using withBinaryFile which is supposed to
close handles automatically.

ghc version used for this windows build is 8.8.4 btw.
