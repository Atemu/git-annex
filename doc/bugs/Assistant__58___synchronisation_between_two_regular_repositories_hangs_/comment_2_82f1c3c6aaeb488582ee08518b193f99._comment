I tried it again with dfifferent usbs and filesystems, and it looks like it only
happens with VFAT (e.g not ext). Retracing my step, here is what I do:

1. Create a repository on my local machine using git-annex assistant.

2. Create another non-bare repository on a VFAT usb stick and combine the two.

3. Add a file to the local repository

4. I doesn't synchronise and log shows the missing index error.

It also happens the other way around. If I

1. Create a repository on the usb device, and

2. create a paired repository on my machine, I get a straight up

        Internal Server Error

        /mnt/USB/annexdir/.git/index: copyFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)
