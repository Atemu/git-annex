Sorry, I think the way I formatted the question made it confusing.

--

Starting in an empty directory, and running this:

```shell
export import_location=level1/level2/level3/level4 && export existing_file_location=level1/level2/level3/level4


mkdir remote-directory
echo \"import content\" > remote-directory/import-file.txt

mkdir repo
cd repo
git init
git annex init
git annex initremote myremote type=directory directory=../remote-directory encryption=none importtree=yes exporttree=yes

mkdir -p ${import_location}
echo \"content\" > ${existing_file_location}/existing-file.txt
git annex add --force-large
git commit -m \"add existing file to annex\"

git annex import master:${import_location} --from myremote
git annex merge myremote/master
```

results in the merge failing with this output:

```
$ git annex merge myremote/master
merge myremote/master 
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
	level1/level2/level3/level4/existing-file.txt
Please move or remove them before you merge.
Aborting

git-annex: merge: 1 failed
```

Should this work, or am I doing something wrong?

All the other combinations of `import_location` and `existing_file_location` in the original post were other things that I tried while trying to work out if I was using `import` correctly, but each scenario was run in a clean starting directory.
