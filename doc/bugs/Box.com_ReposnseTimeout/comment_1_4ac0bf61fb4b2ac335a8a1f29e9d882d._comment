I have another error log:

    29%      653.2KB/s 1m49sgpg: [stdout]: write error: Broken pipe
    gpg: DBG: deflate: iobuf_write failed
    gpg: build_packet failed: file write error
    gpg: [stdout]: write error: Broken pipe
    gpg: iobuf_flush failed on close: file write error
    gpg: symmetric encryption of `[stdin]' failed: file write error
    ResponseTimeout
    git-annex: fd:96: hPutBuf: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
    ResponseTimeout

Some files (very few) are being uploaded properly, so the error is not always reproducible.
