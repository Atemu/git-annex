\"the minimum needed is a way to add a shell script to PATH with the name of the external special remote program\" -- that would of course be simpler; could specify a relative path within the repo itself.  But auto-running an untrusted script fetched along with the repo may be risky.  A Docker/Singularity container could be sandboxed; or maybe `chroot` or `bash -r` would suffice?
