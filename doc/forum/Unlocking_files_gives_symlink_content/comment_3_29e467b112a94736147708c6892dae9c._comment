Did you try Joey's suggestion? “Another way to get out of this situation would be to edit the files, and remove the initial lines so it contains a single line that is the link target of the symlink (the bit with .git/annex/objects in it). Then, git annex fsck would be able to fix up the files.”

What is the output of `readlink test.md` when test.md is locked?
