>  I've added an annex.supportunlocked config that can be set 

you are talking about a regular `git config` configuration variable? then FWIW it is of no use for the original use case of a user cloning an existing git-annex repo since I would have no clue if that repository contains any unlocked files or not.  It could indeed come handy for timing when desired to investigate.

I am yet to appreciate how \"repo-global config\" situation would be different from handling any other git-annex manipulation within `git-annex` branch (e.g. of annex config there) where we already rely on git-annex to \"do the right thing\" (deciding on taking keys availability information based on timestamping etc).
