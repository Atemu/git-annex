Sorry for posting over and over again, just trying to provide info when I discover it.

Here's **/mnt/debian/home/me/annex-backup/.git/config**

[[!format sh \"\"\"
[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
[annex]
        uuid = 86535965-6ca7-4bf3-89af-bca3a07f96f9
        version = 3
        direct = true
        fscknudge = true
        diskreserve = 100 megabyte
        numcopies = 1
        debug = false
[gc]
        auto = 0
[remote \"desktop\"]
        url = /home/me/annex
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/desktop/*
        annex-uuid = 80709bc2-3cbe-434b-b7b9-306278b9a4e9
[remote \"Remote\"]
        annex-rsyncurl = username@example.net:annex/
        annex-uuid = 33930bae-63d2-4a52-b330-58872aaeb1bf
        annex-sync = false
        fetch =\"\"\"]]

1.  Should I remove the \"Remote\" Transfer repo from this config file to prevent it from using the Transfer repo?  I only want this repo to sync directly with the other internal hard disk.

2.  Is it correct for git-annex to add this Transfer repo to this config file in the first place?
