In git-annex version 5.20140606, we have:

	  * Windows: Fix bug introduced in last release that caused files
	    in the git-annex branch to have lines teminated with \r.

There was only 1 week where git-annex had that bug AFAIK, but of
course the broken version could have kept on being used for some time.

It's also always possible that this same problem popped up again in the
code. The fix in 1ab3d7c81049e4ce7e8e47800e2ef1fecb3a9ab4 was to
Annex.Journal and that still seems ok. The merge code is another place
this could perhaps happen.
