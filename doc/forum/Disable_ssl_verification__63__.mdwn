I'm trying to create an S3 special remote with git annex using the following command:

git annex initremote snd-2020-51-in-progress type=S3 encryption=none public=yes host=s3.ki.se bucket=snd-2020-51-in-progress protocol=https requeststyle=path

The result is the following:

initremote snd-2020-51-in-progress (checking bucket...) (creating bucket in US...)
git-annex: HttpExceptionRequest Request {
  host                 = "s3.ki.se"
  port                 = 443
  secure               = True
  requestHeaders       = [("Date","Tue, 13 Apr 2021 23:21:41 GMT"),("Authorization","<REDACTED>"),("x-amz-acl","public-read")]
  path                 = "/snd-2020-51-in-progress/"
  queryString          = ""
  method               = "PUT"
  proxy                = Nothing
  rawBody              = False
  redirectCount        = 10
  responseTimeout      = ResponseTimeoutDefault
  requestVersion       = HTTP/1.1
}
 (InternalException (HandshakeFailed (Error_Protocol ("certificate has unknown CA",True,UnknownCa))))
failed

When I access the S3 bucket using awscli, I use the "--no-verify-ssl" option: 

aws s3 ls s3://snd-2020-51-in-progress/ --no-verify-ssl --endpoint-url https://s3.ki.se

I haven't found anyway to disable ssl verification with git annex. Is this possible? If not, is there any work around?

Thanks!

Best,
Joe
