### Please describe the problem.
When adding a new remote which is not accessible (hence still unsynced) git annex tries to connect to it at each remote operation, even if a specific other remote is given for the command.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
<pre>
git init 1

cd 1
git annex init
touch file
git annex add file
git commit -m"a file"

git clone . ../2

git remote add 2 ../2
git annex sync 2
</pre>
At this point annex syncs with remote "2" and nothing else

But if adding a (currently) unaccessible remote
<pre>
git remote add bad nobody@offline.local:nothing
git annex sync 2
</pre>
gives
<pre>
ssh: Could not resolve hostname offline.local: Name or service not known
ssh: Could not resolve hostname offline.local: Name or service not known
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
commit  ok
pull 2 
ok
push 2 
Everything up-to-date
ok
</pre>
so annex tries to sync with the "bad" remote, even though the command tells it to only sync from "2". I would expect it to only sync with remote "2" in this case.
