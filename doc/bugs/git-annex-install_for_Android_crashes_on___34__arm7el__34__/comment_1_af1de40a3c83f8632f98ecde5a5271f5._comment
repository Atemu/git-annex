The arm build does seem the closest match for this architecture, that's
what I would have tried too.

If you can find a way to get a debian chroot working in termux, that would
point the way to getting git-annex working.

Some Raspberry Pis seem to use arm7el, so maybe Raspbian if Debian doesn't
work?
