### Please describe the problem.

importfeed responds with "failed" when using the option --lazy for specific podcast and no symbolic links get created. However when I don't use the --fast option the podcast enclosures do download and links get created as expected.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git-annex importfeed --fast http://schoolsucksproject.com/category/podcast/feed/

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

    Ubuntu
    git-annex version: 4.20130802-g1452ac3
