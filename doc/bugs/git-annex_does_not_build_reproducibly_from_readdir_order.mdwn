### Please describe the problem.
When building the openSUSE package of git-annex 8.20200522 or 8.20200617, every build has a different git-annex binary as result. 
See https://reproducible-builds.org/ for why this matters.

An underlying issue may be that Assistant/WebApp/Types.o varies in its ordering of various symbols (as seen through objdump -d):

    -0000000000008ba8 <AssistantziWebAppziTypes_jszujqueryzuuizuwidgetzujs7_info>:
    +0000000000008ba8 <AssistantziWebAppziTypes_jszujqueryzuuizumousezujs7_info>:
    -0000000000008cf8 <AssistantziWebAppziTypes_jszulongpollingzujs7_info>:
    +0000000000008cf8 <AssistantziWebAppziTypes_jszujqueryzuuizuwidgetzujs7_info>:
    -000000000003a7c8 <AssistantziWebAppziTypes_csszubootstrapzuthemezucss4_info>:
    +000000000003a7c8 <AssistantziWebAppziTypes_jszubootstrapzujs4_info>:

I found, the build becomes reproducible, when using a filesystem with deterministic readdir order such as disorderfs with sort mode.

https://github.com/bmwiedemann/openSUSE/blob/master/packages/g/git-annex/git-annex.spec#L173 just calls ./Setup build -v
that in turn calls ghc that calls cc and as with a temporary .s file

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    osc checkout openSUSE:Factory/git-annex && cd $_
    osc build --vm-type=kvm --noservice

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
8.20200522 on openSUSE-Tumbleweed-20200628

### Please provide any additional information below.

https://rb.zq1.de/compare.factory/git-annex-compare.out has output from our build-compare tool - might not be very readable here.

I also saw order variations in Types.o around strings that included "activityicon.gif".

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Sorry, not yet a user. Just looking into the openSUSE packaging.
