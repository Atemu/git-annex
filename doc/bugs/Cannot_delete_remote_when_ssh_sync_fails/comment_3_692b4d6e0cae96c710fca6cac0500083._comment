This is still an issue in Ubuntu Focal which has version 8.20200226-1 of git-annex.

What I did here is to create a gcrypt remote on hidrive.strato.com over plain git.  The obfuscated URL is url = \"gcrypt::git.hidrive.strato.com:users/myuser/gcrypt.git#gcrypt\".  That remote shows as \"syncing enabled (metadata only)\" in the webapp interface and cannot be deleted there.
