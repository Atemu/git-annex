when doing ssh host 'echo $PATH', the remote shell running the command is not an interactive shell and thus does NOT source .bashrc, neither is it a login shell and as such does not source .profile or .bash_profile.  Which leaves me wondering: how does git annex log in to the remote machine to run git-annex-shell?  Does it do so via an interactive shell, a login shell, or neither?  Because if it does it via ssh host 'git-annex-shell', then neither .bashrc or .profile can configure its PATH.
