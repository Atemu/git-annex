I think the process that is spawned is actually killed at logout. I tried this with sleep. I don't know about child processes. The problem is that git-annex assistant --autostart (I think) double forks and quits. This means desktop environments have no way of finding those processes. Maybe you can make an option to not fork or make a wrapper that will forward SIG 15 to the daemons.
