git and git-annex do not store a lot of filesystem metadata. [git-annex metadata](https://git-annex.branchable.com/metadata/) actually stores metadata attached to the file key, which means the metadata is attached to the file content not the file path. Filesystems attach metadata to the file location (within a file tree), so if you have two files with the same content but different permissions in different folders you couldn't represent that information using git-annex metadata.

You might checkout using the `git-annex` [borg special remote](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/borg/). You could backup your whole linux system to a borg repository (using standard borg commands). Then you can add that borg repo as a git-annex borg special remote so you could access the files from a git-annex perspective.
