git-annex 0.02 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Can scp annexed files from remote hosts, and check remote hosts for
     file content when dropping files.
   * New move subcommand, that makes it easy to move file contents from
     or to a remote.
   * New fromkey subcommand, for registering urls, etc.

     a given remote.
