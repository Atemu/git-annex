This means that the C implementation of blake2 in the cryptonite library
is optimised using an instruction not supported by your CPU.

My first guess is it's SSE, which gets enabled when cryptonite is built
with the `support_sse` build flag. That flag is not enabled by default;
but perhaps archlinux has enabled it?
