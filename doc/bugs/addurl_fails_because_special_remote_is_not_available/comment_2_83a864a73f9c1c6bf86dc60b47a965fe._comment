If the special remote responds with CLAIMURL-FAILURE, then addurl will not
use it.

There might be some other way the special remote could fail that breaks
addurl. The only one I can see currently is if the special remote sends
something that's not a valid response in the protocol.

So I second Ilya, we need a protocol dump or a better explanation about what
behavior you are seeing.
