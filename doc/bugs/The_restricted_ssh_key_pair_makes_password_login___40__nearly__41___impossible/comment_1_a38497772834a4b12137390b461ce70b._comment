The key pair that the assistant sets up is limited, in ~/.ssh/config to only be used when a mangled version of the hostname is used. That is, you have to \"ssh git-annex-hostname\" to use that key. So it should not be possible for this to impact your normal use of ssh to that host.

(`.git/config` does not support an `IdentityFile` option TTBOMK.)

You need to provide more details about the problem you have encountered.
