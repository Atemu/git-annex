To map a remote, it needs to run `git config --list` on the remote, and the remote may be a non-git-annex git remote. So mapping does a regular ssh first, and cannot use annex.ssh-options (because that would dump it into git-annex-shell). If that fails, it *does* fall back to using git-annex-shell, and will then use annex.ssh-options. 

So, not a bug, I believe.
