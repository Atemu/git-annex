I'm using git version 1.8.4.msysgit.0 on Windows 7 64-bit.

I took a screenshot of git annex init command at [[http://i.imgur.com/YV9vean.png]]

I deleted both the .git and .t folders before re-trying to initialise git annex. However when initialising git annex the 2nd time, folder .t was not created.

Folder `D:\pictures` is an existing folder.
