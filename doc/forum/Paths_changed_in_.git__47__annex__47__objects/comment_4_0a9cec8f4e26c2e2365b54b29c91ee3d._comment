Thanks for your attention, Joey.

Hmm. `git annex fsck` reports 'ok' for all files. After that, running get/whereis I get:

````
git annex get demo_beheer.gpkg
get demo_beheer.gpkg (not available) 
  Try making some of these repositories available:
        a3f8a46a-60fe-58e2-901b-2c093bcc22d3 -- smdata_encrypted_remote_wd_elements_small
failed
git-annex: get: 1 failed
````

this is the remote in question, which is accessible (it's on the same drive as the current repo)

````
git remote -v
smdata_encrypted_remote_wd_elements_small       gcrypt::/media/hans/Elements/smdata_encrypted_remote_wd_elements_small/ (fetch)
smdata_encrypted_remote_wd_elements_small       gcrypt::/media/hans/Elements/smdata_encrypted_remote_wd_elements_small/ (push)
````

However, I can run `git annex sync smdata_remote_wd_elements_small`, which does complete successfully, so why is it not accessible with `get` or `copy`?

If I `lock` demo_beheer.gpkg, it turns into this symlink:

````
lrwxrwxrwx 1 hans hans 198 sep  2 07:32 demo_beheer.gpkg -> .git/annex/objects/px/Mg/SHA256E-s204800--a518c074bc22f673f0c73191a01426fef0a7d8b262a17d2729a4a3ac51da40ce.gpkg/SHA256E-s204800--a518c074bc22f673f0c73191a01426fef0a7d8b262a17d2729a4a3ac51da40ce.gpkg
````

of which the target indeed does not exist (the directory exists, not the file). However, git annex get still fails after locking (and a subsequent sync) and I am at a loss to know why.

This wouldn't be due to the nature of the remote, or my URL for it, or something? Decryption works fine when syncing.
