Hey, I'm not sure whether todo is the right place for feature requests.

When breaking files into chunks, it would be nice to have an option to hash the chunks based on their own content, rather than the content they are a part of.  This would provide for deduplicating data.

I'm using git-annex with an append-only log where adding this would avoid the need to break logs into separate files to not reupload content.  Separate files eventually taxes git's tree size.
