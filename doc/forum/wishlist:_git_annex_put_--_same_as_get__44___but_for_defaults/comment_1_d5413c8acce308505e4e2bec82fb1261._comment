This begs the question: What is the default remote? It's probably *not* the same repository that git's master branch is tracking (ie, origin/master). It seems there would have to be an annex.defaultremote setting.

BTW, mr can easily be configured on a per-repo basis so that \"mr push\" copies to somewhere: `push = git push; git annex push wherever`
