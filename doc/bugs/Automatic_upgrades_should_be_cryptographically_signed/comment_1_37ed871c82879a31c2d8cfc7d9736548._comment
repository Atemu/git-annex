The links to the builds use https. The automatic upgrades use https (and wget or curl, which will reject an invalid SSL certificate).

So, it is cryptographically signed. Of course SSL certificates are only as secure as the CAs. But using a gpg key that most users have no particular reason to trust would not add a lot of security.
