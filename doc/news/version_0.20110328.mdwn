git-annex 0.20110328 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * annex.diskreserve can be given in arbitrary units (ie "0.5 gigabytes")
   * Generalized remotes handling, laying groundwork for remotes that are
     not regular git remotes. (Think Amazon S3.)
   * Provide a less expensive version of `git annex copy --to`, enabled
     via --fast. This assumes that location tracking information is correct,
     rather than contacting the remote for every file.
   * Bugfix: Keys could be received into v1 annexes from v2 annexes, via
     v1 git-annex-shell. This results in some oddly named keys in the v1
     annex. Recognise and fix those keys when upgrading, instead of crashing."""]]
