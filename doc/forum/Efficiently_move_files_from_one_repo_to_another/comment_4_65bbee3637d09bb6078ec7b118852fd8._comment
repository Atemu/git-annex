I discovered one potential problem with this approach. The \"server\" in my example typically has \"--bare\" repos created by gitolite. I'm not sure if I can convince such a repo to get files from the cache. But I will try and report my findings.

Is there a way to tell a remote repo (e.g. the server) to get files from another remote?
