Hi,

[I don't know if this should go to todo or bugs or should be plainly ignored.  Hope it's OK].

Gitlab.com and Gitlab enterprise edition, but unfortunately not Gitlab community edition, now [provides git annex support](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/02/17/gitlab-annex-solves-the-problem-of-versioning-large-binaries-with-git/).  It works fairly based for the repos I have enabled it on.  At the moment it's free, but one may have to pay for repos larger than 5Gb [in the future](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/02/22/gitlab-7-8-released/#comment-1870271594).

Perhaps gitlab.com should be added to preconfigured cloud providers?
