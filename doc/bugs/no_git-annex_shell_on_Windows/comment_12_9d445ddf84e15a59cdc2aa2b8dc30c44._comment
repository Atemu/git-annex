That error message seems to indicate that git-annex does not realize it's
being run with the git-annex-shell program name. When I run "git-annex -c
configlist /path/to/repo" I get that error message; when I run
git-annex-shell with the same parameters, I get the expected repository
config output.

I'm guessing that the windows symlink thing you tried to use confuses the
program path name lookup that it tries to do. I'm pretty sure that a copy
of the file would work.
