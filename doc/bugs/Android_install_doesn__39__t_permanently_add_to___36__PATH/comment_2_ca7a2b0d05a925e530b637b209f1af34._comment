This is the one I used: <http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Android/git-annex-install>

The comment near the top even explicitly admits that it doesn't permanently set up `$PATH`:

```
# This script needs to be sourced into the current termux shell, rather
# than run with a new shell, so it can set the PATH to include git-annex.
```
