Hi Joey, do you think it would be possible to squeeze a solution for the missing symlinks for not-present unlocked files in v8?

Symlinks for missing unlocked files are the last thing missing from V5 for those of us simulating direct mode with adjusted branches and `annex.thin`. For reference <https://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog/day_601__v7_default/> and <https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/symlinks_for_not-present_unlocked_files/>
