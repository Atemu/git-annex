What steps will reproduce the problem?

run

    /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/gpg

from the terminal

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect to see typical gpg output.  Instead, I see

    dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib
        Referenced from: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/gpg
        Reason: Incompatible library version: gpg requires version 8.0.0 or later, but libiconv.2.dylib provides version 7.0.0
    Trace/BPT trap: 5

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git annex Version: 3.20121017 on Mac OS X 10.7.5
