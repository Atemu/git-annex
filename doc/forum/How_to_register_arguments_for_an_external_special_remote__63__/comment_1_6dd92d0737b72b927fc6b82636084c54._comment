This should only happen if your program is responding to LISTCONFIGS
with a list that does not include that parameter.

If it responds with UNSUPPORTED-REQUEST, all configs will be allowed.

I'm not familiar with the python library, but I guess it is doing that, and
probably has a way to specify what configs to list.
