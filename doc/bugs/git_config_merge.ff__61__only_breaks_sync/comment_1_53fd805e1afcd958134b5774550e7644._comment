I feel it's right for git-annex sync to honor git configs, so it's right
for it to not merge origin/master. And, without that merge, it's right for
it to fail to push master to origin. Since it does push synced/master, this
does not prevent other clones of the repo, where git-annex sync is later
ran, from getting the changes made by this sync.

That leaves only this ugly thing:

fatal: ambiguous argument 'refs/heads/master..refs/heads/synced/master': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.

Which comes from Git.Branch.changed, but I'm not clear how the fast forward
configuration would prevent either of those refs from existing.
