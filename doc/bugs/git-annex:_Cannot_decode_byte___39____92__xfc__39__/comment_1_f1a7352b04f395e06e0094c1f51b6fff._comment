I don't think this has to do with the path name of the repository containing utf-8 at all.

Your recipe for reproducing this depends on some pre-existing repository that I don't know how to set up to reproduce this bug. All I can guess is that, based on the \"decodeUtf8\" in the error message, it's coming from the one part of the code that still uses that, the union merger.
