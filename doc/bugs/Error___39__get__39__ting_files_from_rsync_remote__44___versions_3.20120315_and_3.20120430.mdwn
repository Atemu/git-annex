What steps will reproduce the problem?

	$ git annex initremote rsyncremote type=rsync rsyncurl=myuser@rsync.hidrive.strato.com:/users/myuser/git-annex/Music/ encryption=0xC597DECC177AFD7C
	$ git annex get --from rsyncremote "file"

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect that the requested file is copied as for every other remote, but instead I get this error:

----------------------------------------
	get <file> (from rsyncremote...) (gpg) 
	rsync: change_dir "/users/myuser/git-annex/Music/0e5/a5b/'GPGHMACSHA1--3afd32ab8e70ac329262adeb770c330b0845b1e0" failed: No such file or directory (2)

I can verify that the directory /users/myuser/git-annex/Music/0e5/a5b/GPGHMACSHA1--3afd32ab8e70ac329262adeb770c330b0845b1e0 exists in the rsync remote, without the ' character.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I tried versions 3.20120315 and 3.20120430 on Gentoo linux.

Please provide any additional information below.

The rsync remote config in .git/config:

	[remote "rsyncremote"]
		annex-rsyncurl = myuser@rsync.hidrive.strato.com:/users/myuser/git-annex/Music/
		annex-uuid = "UUID"
