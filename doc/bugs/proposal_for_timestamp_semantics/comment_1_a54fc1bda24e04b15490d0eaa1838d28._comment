This is lacking a lot of detail about how this would be accomplished. 

Assuming it's to be accomplished using git-annex metadata, it seems likely
to signficantly slow down some git-annex operations (which would need to do
an expensive git-annex branch lookup).

There's also the complication of merging a git-annex
branch that contains changes to the timestamp metadata. Would git-annex
need to look over all the merged changes and go off and frob timestamps?

[[todo/does_not_preserve_timestamps]] already contains discussion of this
topic. I'm not sure that it's productive to discuss it in two different
places. (Nor does this really seem like a bug report.)
