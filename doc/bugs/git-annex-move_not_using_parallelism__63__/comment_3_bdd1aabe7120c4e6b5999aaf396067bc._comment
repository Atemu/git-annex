I would try adding `--debug`, so `git-annex move -J48 --all --to ilya-s3 --debug` that should give you some insight into the number of simultaneous connections. Seems to be moving concurrently for me, I tried on an s3 remote and a googledrive remote, I saw multiple interleaved uploads in the debug logs as well as multiple simultaneous `git â€¦ cat-file` in my processes.
