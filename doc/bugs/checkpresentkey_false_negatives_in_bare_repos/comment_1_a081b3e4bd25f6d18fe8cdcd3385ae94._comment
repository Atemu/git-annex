git-annex checkpresentkey checks if a key is present in remotes.

Your bare repository does not have any remotes that contain the key
(due to not having any remotes at all). This is why checkpresentkey is
behaving like this.

The same behavior happens if you remove the origin remote from the nonbare
repo and run the command there.

The documentation seems clear enough about this behavior, although there
is the use of "somewhere" in this part:

	When no remote is specified,  it  verifies  if  the  key's  content  is
	present  somewhere, checking accessible remotes until it finds the con‚Äê
	tent.

Which I suppose could be interpreted to mean, if the key
is present in the local repo, it's "somewhere".
