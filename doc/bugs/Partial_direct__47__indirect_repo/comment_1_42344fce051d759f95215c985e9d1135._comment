This can happen if your repository gets annex.direct=true set in its .git/config, without `git annex direct` having been run to truely put it into direct mode.

The proof that this was the case is that `git annex indirect` did anything at all. The first thing `git annex indirect` does is check if it's in a direct mode repository. If not, it steps without doing anything, and without outputting anything.

I think this was user error.
