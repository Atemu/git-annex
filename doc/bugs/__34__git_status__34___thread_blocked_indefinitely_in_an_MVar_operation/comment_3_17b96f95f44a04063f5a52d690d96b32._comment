The command above finally ended. Then `git annex sync` returns:

```
commit 
fatal: Unable to create '/mnt/usb/audio/.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.
ok
fatal: Unable to create '.git/index.lock': .git/index.lock: openFd: already exists (File exists)

If no other git process is currently running, this probably means a
git process crashed in this repository earlier. Make sure no other git
process is running and remove the file manually to continue.


git-annex: .git/index.lock: openFd: already exists (File exists)
failed
git-annex: sync: 1 failed
```

I think I found the problem: my filesystem is probably full after all, I just noticed that `annex.thin` isn't supported on FAT and that the files got duplicated :-(. Bad news for me and my perfect rockbox player backed up with git-annex!
