I had the same error message when trying to run the standalone, version 7.20181106, on my raspberry pi. For some reason, the stand-alone version of git-annex handles and compiles its own locales in 

`~/.cache/git-annex/locales/[SOME_DIRECTORY]/`

For some unknown reason, the locale that git-annex compiled in that directory, namely en_GB.UTF-8 for me, was different from the one from my system, which is kept in `/usr/lib/locale/`.
Every command that git-annex uses, even just rm, was systematically failing with error `cnt < (sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME) / sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME[0]))` after git-annex loaded its own locale instead of the system's (technically, after the runshell script exports LOCPATH=`~/.cache/git-annex/locales/[SOME_DIRECTORY]/`).

Solution I found:
I erased the version that git-annex compiled and instead placed a symbolic link `~/.cache/git-annex/locales/[SOME_DIRECTORY]/en_GB.UTF-8` towards my system's locale in `/usr/lib/locale/`.
Then LC_TIME was correctly defined and I got rid of the error `cnt < (sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME) / sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME[0]))'

Hope this helps.

It looks like the runshell script is doing something incorrect with the compilation of locales, but I'm not sure what.
