I observe that I am encountering the same on my Galaxy Nexus running CM10.1; I see indication that the \"INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL\" is a new permission in Android 4.2 that relates to the use of multiple users, which is one of the new features of 4.2.

It's possible that there are bugs here... See: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=39801
