I've posted about this on the git mailing list. It's possible that these bugs, which can be shown to affect things other than just git-annex, will be fixed in git.

I will wait a while to see. But am considering making git-annex use all-lowercase hash dirs for the log files. Maybe it could first look for .git-annex/aaaa/bbbb/foo.log, but also look for, read, and merge in any info from 
.git-annex/Aa/Bb/foo.log. And always write to the new style filenames. This would avoid confusing git with changes to
mixed-case files, and avoid another massive transition.
