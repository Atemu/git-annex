Yes, will do.  But need to recreate - I repeatedly executed rm -rf .git to repeat the test and left it 'clean'.

PS.  Is there an easy(er) way to 'undo' the creation of a repository without loosing any file content?  One day I will run rm -rf in the wrong place!
After an uninstall of annex it was hard for me to figure out how to start with a clean system when the webapp found the previously created repo.
