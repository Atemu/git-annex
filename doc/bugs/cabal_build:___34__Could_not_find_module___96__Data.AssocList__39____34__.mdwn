What steps will reproduce the problem?

Download current git head (fa5100d) and run cabal update; cabal install --only-dependencies; cabal configure; cabal build

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expect succcessful build, get:

Assistant/Install.hs:24:8:
    Could not find module `Data.AssocList'
    It is a member of the hidden package `hxt-9.3.1.1'.
    Perhaps you need to add `hxt' to the build-depends in your .cabal file.
    Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

building using cabal from clone of git clone git://git-annex.branchable.com/, commit fa5100d (same problem happens with last release, 3.20121127).  On OS X, "Lion".
