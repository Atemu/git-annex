Hi,

I agree to avoid synchronize directories git, but it's not normal ignore the others directories in the same level of the .git directory. For my case, the .git is the garbage of the old project

It would be nice to show a warning message when the files is ignored. Because it's dangerous, the user dont know if the files isn't archived !
