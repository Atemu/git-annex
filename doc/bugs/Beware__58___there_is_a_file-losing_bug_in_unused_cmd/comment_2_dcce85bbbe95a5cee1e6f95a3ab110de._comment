> The annexes were fully synced and git-annex list showed the files in the annex they were dropped from.

That statement does not make a lot of sense. If both repos have been
synced with the other, then git-annex list could only display the file
if it was still in the master branch. But then git-annex unused would
certianly not have considered it unused. (Unless it has an insanely bad bug,
but the test suite tests that it doesn't have that bug, so it seems likely
it does not.)

But also, if both repos were synced with one-another, and you had dropped the
file from one repo, then git-annex list in other other repo would know that and
would not show the file as still being in it.

Which suggests you mean something else by "fully synced" than being fully in
sync at that point. Or that you were mistaken about them being fully in sync.

And if you were mistaken about that, it's easy to set up situations where
two repos are not fully in sync, and so in one, the file is to all appearances
unused, but in the other one, the file is still in use by a branch.

So, without a way to reproduce this, I have to assume it's user error.
