I checkout out the git annex branch and using 

    find * | grep -P \"[\xb4]\"

I found a file

    43e/b16/WORM-s4118528-m1245167306--Jerry Lee Lewis - Whole Lotta Shakin\302\264 Going\302\264 On.mp3.log   

The corresponding file also existed in the master branch (as a link).

I moved both these files to a folder outside my repository and synched my git-annex branch with by master server. I still get the same error. Is there any other place where information about this file is stored?
