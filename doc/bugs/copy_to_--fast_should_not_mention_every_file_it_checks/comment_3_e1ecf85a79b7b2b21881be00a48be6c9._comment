Hi, I've been happily using --to=h2 --not --in h2 for a long time, and now it fails:

    > git annex copy --to h2 --not --in h2
    Usage: git-annex copy [PATH ...] ((-f|--from REMOTE) | (-t|--to REMOTE))
                          ([-A|--all] | [-U|--unused] | [--key KEY]) [-a|--auto]
    zsh: exit 1

I've been using git-annex from debian unstable (x86) for a long time. I think it recently got a significant version upgrade. Currently I'm running: git-annex 5.20150727-2

I'm not married to this particular commandline, it was posted as a workaround after all.

How can I copy files without checking if each exists on the remote, instead trusting the local cache of what the remote has?

I have many thousands of files annexed, and this remote is a bare repo that is only accessed from this host, so the local info about what the remote has is trustworthy.
