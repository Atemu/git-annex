### Please describe the problem.
I have lots of content stored in Amazon S3. Using git-annex from before commit 911ba8d972e4e7b151385d30c198598e1a0dfaca, I am able to ``git annex get`` from S3 and files are downloaded.
Using a more recent version (eg that commit, or the current master, or release 20150409), I am unable to download the content.

I'm not sure if my repo or remote is somehow misconfigured, or if there's something else going on here.

--Walter

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Use a version of git-annex with s3-aws

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Debian, versions as above

### Please provide any additional information below.
