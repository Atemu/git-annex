The "filterdriver" branch implements support for these.

However, it's actually slower than the old interface, because the new
interface requires git-annex read the whole file content from git when
adding a file, and the old interface let it not read any content.

Since the new interface does have capabilities, a new capability could
prevent schepping the content over the pipe, and let the filter driver
refer to the worktree file instead, and respond with the path of a file.
This would be similar to my old patch set for the old interface.
