I'm having trouble getting unlocked files in version 7 repositories to work and I think I'm pretty confused (what I mean is that it's not git annex's fault).

I have my Calibre library in a git-annex repo. I want ```metadata.db```, Calibre's sqlite database to stay unlocked but I don't get the expected results.
Also I put ```metadata.db annex.largefiles=nothing``` in my ```.gitattributes``` file, could this be causing an issue?


 
Version information:  
  
OS X 10.14  

    $ git annex version
    git-annex version: 7.20190322
    ...
    local repository version: 7

Edit metadata for book in Calibre and then (using git add here to just make sure):  

    $ git add metadata.db
    $ git commit -m "metadata changes"
    [master 5602968d1] metadata changes
      1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
    $ git annex find metadata.db
    $ echo $?
    0 

Are git annex pointer files hardlinks? I tried:  

    $ ls -i metadata.db
    1497387 metadata.db
    $ find . -inum 1497387
    metadata.db 

I was expecting a second file there?

Anyway, thanks for any help with this.
