> It's not a very usual configuration to have 2 repositories on the same machine with the git-annex assistant running in both. You might just want to configure the assistant to not run in the backup repository.

Maybe that's the crux of the problem.  But I'm not sure what I did wrong to make that happen.  I have a second internal hard disk in my desktop system, and I wanted to put a Full Backup repo on it.  I tried to add a \"Removable drive\" repo (since I sometimes unplug it to swap cables with a DVD drive), but since the assistant didn't detect any actual removable drives, that didn't work.  So I used \"Add another repository\" and set it to a Full Backup repo.  Is that the wrong way to do it?  :)

> Some of the things you've said suggest that the backup repository might not be immediately noticing when changes are pushed to it. Since its location is shown as /mnt/debian/home/me, I have to wonder if that's some NFS mount or other network filesystem causing problems.

/mnt/debian is /dev/mapper/lvm-root, another internal disk.  The disk is working fine.  :)
