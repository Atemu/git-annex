   * Ignore setsid failures.
   * Avoid leaving behind .tmp files when failing in some cases, including
     importing files to a disk that is full.
   * Avoid bad commits after interrupted direct mode sync (or merge).
   * Fix build with wai 0.3.0.
   * Deal with FAT's low resolution timestamps, which in combination with
     Linux's caching of higher res timestamps while a FAT is mounted, caused
     direct mode repositories on FAT to seem to have modified files after
     they were unmounted and remounted.
   * Windows: Fix opening webapp when repository is in a directory with
     spaces in the path.
   * Detect when Windows has lost its mind in a timezone change, and
     automatically apply a delta to the timestamps it returns, to get back to
     sane values."""]]
