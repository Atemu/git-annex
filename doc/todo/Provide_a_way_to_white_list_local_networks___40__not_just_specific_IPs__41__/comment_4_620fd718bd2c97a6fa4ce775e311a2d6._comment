Back to the proxy question, I suppose if you have multiple internal 
networks and the proxy can only access one of them (eg your DMZ),
then allowing access to the proxy is not as bad as "all".

And then DMZ/24 makes explicit that git-annex can access everything in that
network.

Nor am I opposed to that syntax generally (although as I user, I consider
it pretty opaque TBH, not being in the habit of counting bits in my head).
The only haskell implementation I can find is in the `ip` package,
which would be a new dependency for git-annex.
