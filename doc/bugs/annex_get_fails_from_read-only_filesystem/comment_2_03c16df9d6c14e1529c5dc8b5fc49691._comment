i've seen problems like this not related to upgrades at all, in [[todo/read-only removable drives]]. furthermore, it seems to me that failure to upgrade a repository shouldn't be fatal and we should be able to recover and get files anyways, in the spirit of [[backwards compatibility|future_proofing]]. --[[anarcat]]
