Hmmm. Could you talk more about your use case “The use case I have in mind is syncing photos to an Android tablet in a v5 repository.”?

Lets say I have a nice collection of family photos on my desktop computer annexed in a folder called family. Lets say we have `numcopies` set at 1. I keep only the best photos, so it always about 1gb. In the family folder I have nice organized sub-folders and I add new images occasionally. I have an Android tablet that sits on my coffee table and I want visitors to be able to open the tablet, run some gallery app and view all my family photos. Sometimes i'll grab the tablet and take it with me to family gatherings, so I want all the photos on in, ready for offline viewing.

With this use case, perhaps I run assistant inside termux. I clone family into `/data/data/com.termux/files/home` set it as standard group `transfer` and call it `t`, I also clone it into `/storage/emulated/0`, set it as standard group client, and call this crippled client repo `c`.  Our `c` folder should now be accessible to any Android photo gallery app. As we make changes to family, on our desktop, assistant on the Android tablet brings them in, when we have wifi, it will probably copy them directly to `c`?

If I take a photo on my tablet, put it in the `c` directory (which is accessible from my photo app), then this photo should be copied directly to family (if I have wifi). If I don't have have wifi, this photo should be immediately copied to `t` in which case I have two copies of the file on my tablet. If I delete the photo from the crippled filesystem `c` I still have the one in `t`. If I re-connect to wifi, perhaps the photo will get sent to family.

Maybe I want to save some space on my tablet. So I open up my photo app, browse to my `c` folder and start putting a bunch of files in a sub-folder named `archive`. They are immediately deleted from tablet (unless they were never synced to `family` in which case I have two copies of them, so still have a copy sitting in `transfer`). If I delete files when I have no wifi, presumably they will just get copied to `t` since git-annex cannot verify the copy at `family`?

Would something like that work for your use case Joey?
