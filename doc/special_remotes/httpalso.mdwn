This special remote allows downloading annexed objects from other remotes
that also publish their content by http. Not to be confused with the [[web]]
special remote, this one is only useful in combination with some other
special remote.

Suppose, for example, that you have a [[directory]] special remote. And the
directory happens to be published by a web server. (Or it could be a
[[rsync]] special remote, or many other kinds.) To let git-annex know that
the content of this special remote can also be accessed over http, set up
a httpalso special remote.

	git annex initremote --sameas=foo foo-http type=httpalso url=http://example.com/foo

The --sameas parameter tells git-annex what other special remote this httpalso
remote is accessing. (See [[tips/multiple_remotes_accessing_the_same_data_store]].)
Since the httpalso remote is read-only, it can only be used to download
content that is stored in that other remote.

This special remote is compatible with many, but not all, other special
remotes. If the special remote does something unusual with the name
a file is stored under, or with how the data is stored, it might not work.
See [[tips/multiple_remotes_accessing_the_same_data_store]]
for a list of known working combinations.

## configuration

* `url` - The http or https url to where the content is stored by the
  other special remote.
