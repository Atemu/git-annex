So, I see that you *did* tell git-annex to treat your home git repo as a
git-annex repo.

And, starting the the assistant/webapp from inside a git annex repository is
intended to start them running in that repository. This behavior makes a
lot of sense in general. It's consistent with running any other git command
inside a git repository causing that command to run on that repository.

I guess that the issue here is, opening the git-annex webapp from a menu
causes the program to run with its working directory set to HOME. But in
this case, the HOME is only incidental, the intent is not to start the
webapp/assistant in that repository.

Seems kind of hard for the assistant to determine intent though.

So, the best that can be done, I suppose, is to make starting the webapp 
in the HOME git repository behave as if that git repository was not
initialized for use by git-annex.
