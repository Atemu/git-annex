The following occurs in a directory that is shared on an NFS server:

    /media/mybook/movies $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /media/mybook/movies/.git/
    /media/mybook/movies $ git annex init mybook-movies
    init mybook-movies 
    git-annex: waitToSetLock: resource exhausted (No locks available)
    failed
    git-annex: init: 1 failed
    /media/mybook/movies $

This happens reliably.  Is there any way around it?  I have shell
access on the NFS server, but it is a NAS, so I don't think it is
capable of running git-annex.
