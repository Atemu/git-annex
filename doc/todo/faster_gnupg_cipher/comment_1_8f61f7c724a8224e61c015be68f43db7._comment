There is a remote.name.annex-gnupg-options git-config setting that can be used to pass options to gpg on a per-remote basis.

> also wonder if using the same symmetric key for many files presents a security issues (and whether using GPG keys directly would be more secure).

I am not a cryptographer, but I have today run this question by someone with a good amount of crypo knowledge. My understanding is that reusing a symmetric key is theoretically vulnerable to eg known-plaintext or chosen-plaintext attacks. And that modern ciphers like AES and CAST (gpg default) are designed to resist such attacks.

If someone was particularly concerned about these attack vectors, it would be pretty easy to add a mode where git-annex uses public key encryption directly. With the disadvantage, of course, that once a file was sent to a special remote and encrypted for a given set of public keys, other keys could not later be granted access to it.
