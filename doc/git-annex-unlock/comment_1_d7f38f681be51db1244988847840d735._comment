> Normally, unlocking a file requires a copy to be made of its content, so that its original content is preserved

Does that imply than, on v7 in a file system that does not support hard links such as FAT32, `git annex adjust --unlock` would effectively be creating a duplicate of all files via cp (which is incredibly costly time-wise specially for big repos and huge files) and would effectively double the size it occupies?
