There is now a workaround; S3 special remotes can be configured to use [[chunking]]. 

For example, to reconfigure an existing mys3 remote: `enableremote mys3 chunk=1MiB`

I'm leaving this bug open because chunking is not the default (although the assistant does enable it by default), and because this chunking operates at a higher, and less efficient level than S3's own multipart upload API. In particular, AWS will charge a fee for each http request made for a chunk.

Adding proper multipart support will probably require switching to a different S3 library.
