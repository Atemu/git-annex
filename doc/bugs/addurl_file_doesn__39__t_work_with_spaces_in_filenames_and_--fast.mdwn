###What steps will reproduce the problem?
    $ git annex addurl 'file:///$HOME/space file' --fast
    addurl _$HOME_space%20file 
      unable to access url: file:///$HOME/space file
    failed
    git-annex: addurl: 1 failed

    $ git annex addurl 'file:///home/arand/space\ file' --fast
    addurl _home_arand_space%5C%20file 
      unable to access url: file:///home/arand/space\ file
    failed
    git-annex: addurl: 1 failed

###What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I guess it's semi-expected to fail since spaces aren't supposed to be in urls, but with file:// it would be nice if that restriction was lessened.

###What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Debian sid/experimental

    git-annex version: 4.20130227
    local repository version: 4
    default repository version: 3
    supported repository versions: 3 4
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2
