I managed to get the lookup_key() working with sharedpubkey, chunks and mac SHA512, by combining Joey's cipher and yibe's script.

I have to clean the script before posting, but it is basically Yibe's script [(at the bottom of this page)](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/Decrypting_files_in_special_remotes_without_git-annex/) with the sharedpubkey cipher above, and nothing more.

    +    elif [ \"$encryption\" = \"sharedpubkey\" ] ; then
    +        cipher=\"$(echo -n \"$cipher\" | base64 -d)
    +\"
        fi

It is working good for my test file, but this file is made of 1 chunk only. Before relying on the script, more tests should be done with bigger files, e.g more chunks.

Anyway, thks to all of you for your help.
