Well, depends on coreutils and needs a stat(1) parser. Also, will sftp
servers necessarily let arbitrary commands be run over ssh? Driving sftp
interactive and parsing its ls -l would add more complexity to getting file
size.

The url security fixes also mean these uris can't be used without relaxing
the security policy.. Makes me wonder how much special-casing makes sense
for such an edge feature.
