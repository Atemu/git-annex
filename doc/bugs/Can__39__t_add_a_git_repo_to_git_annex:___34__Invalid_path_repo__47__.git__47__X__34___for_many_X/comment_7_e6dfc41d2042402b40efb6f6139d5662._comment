I appreciate the investigation.

Now that there's a direct mode guard, it would be possible to have git-annex translate .git directories to some other name when adding files to git. This seems more likely than getting git changed.

However, I am not convinced *at all* that it makes any sense to try to sync git repositories in this way. I realize that some people drop git checkouts into dropbox and use that, but it's a fundamentally unsound thing to do, and those people are just lucky if they manage to avoid running into problems doing that.

If you have two clones of a repo, and a git repository is checked into both, and they become partitioned for a while and larger re-merge, then there can be conflicts in the files that make up the git repository. Which git-annex would auto-resolve, with the effect that the checked-in git repository would appear to be broken.

Also, this feature would only be used by a small number of users, on the border between people who can use git the Correct Way, and people who don't use git other than with the assistant.

It would make sense to make git-annex refuse to add files inside nested git repositories though.
