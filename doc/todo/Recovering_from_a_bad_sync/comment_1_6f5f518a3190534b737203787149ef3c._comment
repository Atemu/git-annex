If this is a todo item at all, it may make sense to make `git annex sync` sync even with git remotes that have no annex-uuid.

As far as solving the problem, I think you just need to sync more in order to get the full list of remotes propigated around to all the remotes. Sync automatically merges disconnected git histories no matter how they got that way or how long they have been disconnected or diverged.
