Fixed several bugs involving upgrade to v7 when the git repository
already v7 contained unlocked files. The worst of those involved direct
mode and caused the whole file content to get checked into git. While
that's a fairly unusual case, it's an ugly enough bug that I rushed out a
release to fix it.
