I believe that these zombies were all caused by switching between repository views in the webapp. I was able to reproduce 1 zombie per switch between repos.

There are a few other places where git-annex execs itself, but not many, and most of them are often used and it would be noticed if they were crypts from which pour forth the living dead. (Oddly the TV show I was thinking about watching this evening.)

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/src/git-annex>git grep readProgramFile
Assistant/Repair.hs:		program <- readProgramFile
Assistant/Threads/Cronner.hs:	program <- liftIO $ readProgramFile
Assistant/Threads/Cronner.hs:			program <- readProgramFile
Assistant/Threads/Transferrer.hs:	program <- liftIO readProgramFile
Assistant/TransferSlots.hs:		program <- liftIO readProgramFile
Assistant/WebApp/Control.hs:		program <- readProgramFile
Assistant/WebApp/OtherRepos.hs:	program <- readProgramFile
Assistant/XMPP/Git.hs:		program <- readProgramFile
Command/Assistant.hs:	program <- readProgramFile
Config/Files.hs:readProgramFile :: IO FilePath
Config/Files.hs:readProgramFile = do
Remote/Git.hs:		program <- readProgramFile
