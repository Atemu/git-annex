[Gitolite](https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite) is a git repository
manager. Here's how to add git-annex support to gitolite, so you can
`git annex copy` files to a gitolite repository, and `git annex get`
files from it.

A nice feature of using gitolite with git-annex is that users can be given
read-only access to a repository, and this allows them to `git annex get`
file contents, but not change anything.

First, you need new enough versions:

* gitolite 2.2 is needed -- this version contains a git-annex-shell ADC
  and supports "ua" ADCs.
* git-annex 3.20111016 or newer needs to be installed on the gitolite
  server. Don't install an older version, it wouldn't be secure!

And here's how to set it up. The examples are for gitolite as installed
on Debian with apt-get, but the changes described can be made to any
gitolite installation, just with different paths.

1. Set `$GL_ADC_PATH` in `.gitolite.rc`, if you have not already done so.
   
	echo '$GL_ADC_PATH = "/usr/local/lib/gitolite/adc/;' >>~gitolite/.gitolite.rc

2. Make the ADC directory, and a "ua" subdirectory.
   
	mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/gitolite/adc/ua

3. Install the git-annex-shell ADC into the "ua" subdirectory and make it
   executable.
   
	cd /usr/local/lib/gitolite/adc/ua/
	wget https://raw.github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/pu/contrib/adc/git-annex-shell
	chmod +x git-annex-shell

4. Now all gitolite repositories can be used with git-annex just as any
   ssh remote normally would be used. For example:
