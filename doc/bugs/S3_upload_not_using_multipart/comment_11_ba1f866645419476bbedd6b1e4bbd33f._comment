Implemented on s3-aws-multipart branch. But..

* Needs version of haskell aws library not released yet.
* Does not currently provide a progress display when doing a multipart
  upload.
* Uses 900+ mb of memory when uploading a 500 mb file with partsize=100mb.
  (I think this is due to Aws.S3.Commands.Multipart.chunkedConduit,
  which it probably can't use if it's to do progress displays anyway).
