       Each - is matched against the set of refs accu‚Äê
       mulated  so far.  Any matching refs are removed
       from the set.

It matches against the literal text of the ref that was added, so if you
 use "+*", it adds refs/heads/master, and then to remove that, you need
 "-refs/heads/master" not "-master". On the other hand, "+master:-master"
results in "master" being added and then removed.

Clarified to mention that it matches by name; I suppose perhaps you were
thinking it matches based on what sha1 the ref name resolves to. The reason it
doesn't do that is that it would be surprising for "+foo:-master" to not include
ref foo just because it happens to currently have the same sha1 as master does.
