The failing test case is testing all the hashes that git-annex uses.
Quite likely what has happened is that the hash implementation has been
built with a CPU-specific optimisation that is not available on your AMD.

The hash implementations are in http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptonite

While cryptonite has build flags for CPU-specific features,
there are also, in its C code, some checks of gcc defines that indicate
specific CPU features. I found #defines checking `__SSE2__` and `__SSE4__`
and `__AVX__` (mostly in blake2) and there might be others. That seems
likely to be a bug in cryptonite, if its build flags are not fully
controlling use of things like SSE.

I've made a change to git-annex's test suite to narrow down the problem;
it now tests each hash individually, so you'll see which specific ones
fail.
