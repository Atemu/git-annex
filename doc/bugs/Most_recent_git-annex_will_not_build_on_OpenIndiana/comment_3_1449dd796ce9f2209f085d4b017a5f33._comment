Your Makefile change, even with the uname corrected, had no impact at all.  I'm running \"cabal install\".  When I try just \"make\", I get this error:


    Annex.hs:69:28:
        No instance for (MonadBase IO (StateT AnnexState IO))
          arising from a use of `liftBase'
        Possible fix:
          add an instance declaration for
          (MonadBase IO (StateT AnnexState IO))
        In the second argument of `(.)', namely `liftBase'
        In the expression: Annex . liftBase
        In an equation for `liftBase': liftBase = Annex . liftBase
