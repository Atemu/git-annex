From one of my repositories (UUIDs redacted, I doubt that's required but better safe than sorry):

    $ git show git-annex:activity.log
    XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX4e Fsck timestamp=1509040059.713438476s
    XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX41 Fsck timestamp=1509495891.418704179s
    XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX28 Fsck timestamp=1496379403.744140736s
    XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX20 Fsck timestamp=1527838142.197908353s
    XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXdb Fsck timestamp=1530951201.006459518s
    XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX37 Fsck timestamp=1509828389.73059196s

Those appear to be Unix timestamps, easily converted to human-readable with, e.g., `date -d @TIMESTAMP` (without the `s` at the end; at least with GNU date). E.g., the last one becomes Sat Nov  4 16:46:29 EDT 2017.

Sometimes there are multiple lines per-repository; not sure what determines how long they're kept. Before running `git-annex sync`, this one had dozens of lines of history; sync cleaned it up. Of course, those lines of history remain in the git history.
