### Please describe the problem.

Seems to not upload files from Android client (set to "Manual mode: only stores files you...") to servers configured to get the files despite "syncing enabled"

Even when I chose "File source:" mode -- it just dropped all locally stored ones and didn't transfer those I have added.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Add file to the sdcard (vfat), and see it added to git (annex) but not uploaded

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Android build as now of Dec 13 I believe

### Please provide any additional information below.

First it just said that nothing to be transfered, I have switched  that remote to "Full backup", web dashboard had "Scanning for files to transfer" for a while, then refreshed with "Synced with" and no file transfers running.  Below is an excerpt from the log
