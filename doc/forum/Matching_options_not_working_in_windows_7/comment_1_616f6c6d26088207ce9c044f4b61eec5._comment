Lucky for you, I tried it on linux, and it also fails there.

I think the problem is, --largerthan and --smallerthan only work on annexed
files, not on files you want to add to the annex. This is probably a bug.

What does work is to configure annex.largefiles and disable
annex.addsmallfiles:

git config annex.largefiles 'largerthan=200mb'
git config annex.addsmallfiles false
