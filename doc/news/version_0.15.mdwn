git-annex 0.15 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Support scp-style urls for remotes (host:path).
   * Support ssh urls containing "~".
   * Add trust and untrust subcommands, to allow configuring repositories
     that are trusted to retain files without explicit checking.
   * Fix bug in numcopies handling when multiple remotes pointed to the
     same repository.
   * Introduce the git-annex-shell command. It's now possible to make
     a user have it as a restricted login shell, similar to git-shell.
   * Note that git-annex will always use git-annex-shell when accessing
     a ssh remote, so all of your remotes need to be upgraded to this
     version of git-annex at the same time.
   * Now rsync is exclusively used for copying files to and from remotes.
     scp is not longer supported."""]]
