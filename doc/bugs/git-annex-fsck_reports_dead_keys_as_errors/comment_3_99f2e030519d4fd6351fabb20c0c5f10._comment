\"having a file in your working tree whose content is missing is something that it's reasonable for fsck to mention as a problem\" -- makes sense.  For [[`git-annex-fsck --key`|git-annex-fsck]], not sure you need to warn about an explicitly [[`git-annex-dead`|git-annex-dead]]'ed key, but I guess that depends on the context in which the command is used.
