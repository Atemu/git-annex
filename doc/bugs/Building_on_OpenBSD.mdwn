### Please describe the problem.
Hi!
I just tried to build git-annex through cabal on OpenBSD and encountered some issues.

First I had to install a certain commit of network-info that fixes some compile-time errors (https://github.com/jystic/network-info/issues/6)
Then I had to disable WebDAV in git-annex because DAV wouldn't build (I don't use webdav anyway)

After this git-annex still failed to build, though configure works.
### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Compiling on openbsd through cabal

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex-5.20131130 on OpenBSD 5.4

### Please provide any additional information below.
