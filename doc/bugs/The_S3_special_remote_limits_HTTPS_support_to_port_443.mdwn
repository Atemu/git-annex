### Please describe the problem.
The S3 special remote assumes that yout want to use HTTPS iff your service runs on port 443. This isn't true for most minio deployments.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Attempt to add a S3 service using HTTPS and a port != 443 as special remote.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Version 7.20181121 on MacOS and 7.20190130-g024120065 on FreeBSD

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes. I only encountered the problem because git-annex works well enough for me that I want to put a lot more data into it.
