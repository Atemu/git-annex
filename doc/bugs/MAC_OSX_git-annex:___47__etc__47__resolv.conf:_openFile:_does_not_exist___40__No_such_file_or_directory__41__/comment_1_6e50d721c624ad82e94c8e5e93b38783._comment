Based on the comments in <http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Android:_no___34____47__etc__47__resolv.conf__34___when_submitting_jabber_user_and_password./>
it seems that this system does have a /etc/resolv.conf.

I'm left wondering if perhaps the file was briefly missing. For example, perhaps when moving between networks.

Did git-annex break in some way? Is it working now with the file present?
