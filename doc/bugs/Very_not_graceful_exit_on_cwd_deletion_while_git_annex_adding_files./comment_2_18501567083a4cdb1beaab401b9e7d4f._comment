Thank you for the detailed and timely response.

That was some good thinking there with this being a possible attack vector. Food for thought right there.

Btw, I'm sorry for explaining what I did instead of providing you with commands to reproduce the bug. I don't know what I was thinking. Git-annex has been a very big part of my life these last few years and I got a little nervous while writing the bug report. lol

I shall be more careful with from where I run my commands henceforth.
