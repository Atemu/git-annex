Your .gitattributes setting configured git-annex to not
treat metadata.db as a large file, so its content gets added to git.

git-annex does not hard link locked files by ddefault, setting annex.thin
can make it do so.

There is not currently a way to configure whether a file
is added locked or unlocked by filename. I have opened a todo
about it, [[todo/annex.addunlocked_in_gitattributes]].
