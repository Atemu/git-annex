I cannot reproduce this problem with git-annex version 5.20150706.
I don't remember any bug fixes in this area though. 

Note that "fatal: core.bare and core.worktree do not make sense" is
not a git-annex error message. It is a git error message. I conclude
you didn't configure them right, and since git-annex works in my testing
with the two variables set correctly, I'm going to close this bug report.
