I can reproduce this bug. Seems the problem is that sshTranscript is called with a string that is fed in on stdin. But I guess that on Windows, ssh password prompting is also done using stdin (on Linux it would use /dev/tty), and so this prevents it from prompting.

I've fixed this for the remote ssh server setup in the webapp, which did not actually need to feed anything in on stdin. Confirmed ssh adding works!

However, for rsync.net, the ssh pubkey is fed into dd using stdin, and so I was unable to fix it there yet. Since rsync.net does not support redirection to files in its shell, the only approach that would seem to work is to first download the authorized_keys file, add the line, and rsync in the new file. Until I get a chance to do that, I am leaving this bug report open.
