### Please describe the problem.
When stall detection is enabled, debug output for transfers with external special remotes appears to be hidden.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git config annex.stalldetection true
    git annex copy file --to=externalspecialremote --debug 2>&1 | grep PROGRESS
    # no lines output

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

I'm on RHEL7 and this problem is present in git master for me ever since the introduction of stall detection: 135757d64 through 4d6f74477

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I've written ESRPs and recovered many lost files =)
