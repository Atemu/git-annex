I've reproduced a crash on OSX, involving not kqueue, but the WebApp's use of getaddrinfo. I've fixed that, but several things you've said in this bug report don't 100% add up to this being the same crash you've been seeing (for one thing, this can't affect `git annex watch`), so I'll wait for you to confirm.
