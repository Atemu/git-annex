A few problems with using git-annex this way..

git init fails in sdcard because it tries to chmod something. It works in
the termux home directory. Note that only the git bundled with git-annex
has this problem; the termux one works (probably it's patched like I did in
the android git-annex port). Hacking the standalone build to not run the
bundled git should work.

git annex init fails with a getUserEntryForID exception. 
This should be easy to fix in git-annex.

If a git-annex repository is copied over to the android device from
elsewhere, git-annex does work in it. The assistant works.

The webapp doesn't know how to open an url, but copy and paste of the
url to a web browser works and the webapp mostly works then.
