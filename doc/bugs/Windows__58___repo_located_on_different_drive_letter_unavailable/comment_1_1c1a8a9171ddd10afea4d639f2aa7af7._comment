This is the same thing I saw with the bug at http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Windows:_Annex_can_not_get_files/

I tried to manually add the annex UID to the remote reference, and it would show up as available (and then it could sync the repos), but I still couldn't get it to \"git annex  get\" a file.
