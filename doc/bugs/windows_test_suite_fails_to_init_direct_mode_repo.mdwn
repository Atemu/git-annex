For some reason the test suite on windows is failing to set up the direct
mode repo; git-annex direct fails because the repo is a v7 repo in adjusted
unlocked mode.

It seems it's not running git-annex init with --version=5,
or it does and it gets ignored.

I have not managed to reproduce this outside of the test suite.
I wonder if perhaps the environment variable that the test suite sets
to communicate with itself is not working on Windows, which sometimes
has gotchas around environment variables. --[[Joey]]

Hmm, I reordered the direct mode tests to come first, and the failure went
away. Think that .t/repo gets reused, and being already a v7 repo, git annex
init --version=7 silently did not change it. (Made that error out.)
So the test suite should use different paths for the base repo in each test
pass.
