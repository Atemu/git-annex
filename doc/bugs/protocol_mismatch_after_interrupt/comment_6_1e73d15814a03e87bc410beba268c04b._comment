Hello, it seems I am hitting the same problem. Now my server is a very new version (because I use a synology NAS and your install guide shows how to use the latest tar.gz). Now I certainly need to update my client (Ubuntu 14.04) which ships with version 20140412 (installed via apt-get install). I have no idea on how to install a newer version for Ubuntu. I could not find a ppa nor guidelines. Any help on this? Thanks ;)
