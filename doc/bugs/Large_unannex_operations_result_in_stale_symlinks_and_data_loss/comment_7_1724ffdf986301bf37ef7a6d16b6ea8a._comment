If unannex makes the file a hard link to the annexed content, it will be mode 444 or so. But if the user changes the permissions and modifys it, that will corrupt the content still in the annex!

So the current --fast behavior seems no worse than the proposed behavior. And it's not at all clear to me that this would be a better default behavior for unannex than the current behavior, which at least ensures that data left in the annex (and referred to by another annexed file) cannot be corrupted.
