When adding files to git annex, softlinks are created with current atime (and ctime, etc). Instead, the atime of the added file should be used and added to the meta-data, restoring it everywhere an annex is cloned to. -- RichiH

Optionally, editing the meta-data should change the times in all annexes.

Photos and the like need absolute timestamps more than source code which is fine with relative timestamps (local builds & updates). Maintaining global timestamps for source code could even cause a lot of unwanted effects. As it is, this issue is the only, but a major, blocker for me before I can start adapting git-annex. As I have three different use cases for it, this is a shame. Unfortunately, I don't speak any Haskell so scratching my own itch isn't do-able (without major effort and not soon, at least). Is there a realistic chance that you will tackle this nonetheless or is this WONTFIX? -- RichiH

>>>>>> Thanks a lot. Doing this in a new git-annex repo from the start should at least ensure local consistency and I assume I can simply add a post-pull hook to restore the mtimes on all all other repositories? -- RichiH

    #!/bin/sh
    if ! type metastore >/dev/null; then echo "$0: metastore is not installed; exiting"; exit 1; fi

    git add .metadata

>>>>>>>> After getting to actually play with this from different machines with a bare git as central instance for several distributed repos, the metastore trick does not work. The .metadata is causing merge conflicts for every pull. I removed the "done" tag from this issue. -- RichiH
