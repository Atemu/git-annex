@torarnv thanks for pointing that out.. I finally got around to verifying
that, and was able to speed up the smudge filter. Also this avoids the
problem that git for some reason buffers the whole file content in memory
when it sends it to the smudge filter, which is a pretty bad memory leak in git
that no longer affects this.
