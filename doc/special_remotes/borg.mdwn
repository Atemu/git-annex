This special remote type accesses annexed files stored in a
[borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/) repository.

Unlike most special remotes, git-annex cannot be used to store annexed
files in this special remote. You store files by using borg as usual, to
back up the git-annex repository. Then `git-annex sync` will learn about
the annexed files that are stored in the borg repository.

## configuration

These parameters can be passed to `git annex initremote` to configure the
remote:

* `borgrepo` - The location of a borg repository, eg a path, or
  `user@host:path` for ssh access.

* `subdir` - The subdirectory within the borg repository where git-annex
  should look for annex object files. The default is to look through the
  whole borg repository.

  This is useful to avoid learning about annex objects in the borg
  repository that belong to unrelated git-annex repositories. It can also
  make syncing faster.

## setup example

	# borg init --encryption=keyfile /path/to/borgrepo
	# git annex initremote borg type=borg borgrepo=/path/to/borgrepo
	# borg create /path/to/borgrepo `pwd`::{now}
	# git annex sync borg
