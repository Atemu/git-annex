Hmm, I don't reproduce this here.

Also AFAIK there is no difference in the code path used here
to move a file into the annex between v5 and v6. Does it happen with v5?

Seems there is either something in your environment (umask, core.sharedRepository
git config etc though I don't think any of those would explain this
particular file mode) or the build on stretch is somehow behaving differently.
