I'm using git-annex for precisely this use case. I manage files on my Sansa Clip Zip, Odroid Go, and Pi1541 with it. I use a directory special remote for each device pointing at its mount point, with remote.<name>.annex-ignore-command set to `lsblk -no uuid,mountpoint | egrep -qx '<uuid>\s+<mountpoint>'` to make sure git-annex only tries to touch the remote when it's mounted. I just rename any files in the repo that have invalid names.
