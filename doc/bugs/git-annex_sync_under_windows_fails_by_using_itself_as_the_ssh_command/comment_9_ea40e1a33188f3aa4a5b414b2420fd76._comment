By default on windows in direct mode sshcaching is disabled but it seems like in [5.2010617](https://git-annex.branchable.com/news/version_5.20150617/) there was this change:

`sync, remotedaemon: Pass configured ssh-options even when annex.sshcaching is disabled.`

which might explain why GIT_SSH is still set up and points to git-annex instead of ssh?
