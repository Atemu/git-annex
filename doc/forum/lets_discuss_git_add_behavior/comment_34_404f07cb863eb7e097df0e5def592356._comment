@joey

First, thanks a lot for this solution, which seems to strike a good balance between various use-cases.

Second, I apologize for concluding my comment (which was intended as constructiveâ€¦) on a too-strongly-worded disclaimer about how I'd felt when upgrading. I thought it would give you grounds for discarding my opinion (if you felt it wasn't well-founded) as that of a someone unthinkingly annoyed at seeing one's workflow changed. I certainly didn't intend to push you around in any way.
