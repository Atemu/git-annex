Even if currently may be only supports, http for the protocol, isn't it more general - i.e. \"map2url\" functionality which then could fetch data via any protocol (http, https, ftp, and potentially some URLs supported by external special remotes).  My point is that I do not see why it needs to be \"http\" special remote, and not some \"map2url\"?
