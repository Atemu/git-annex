Note that dropkey does *not* check if other copies exist, so the --force is
unncessary; eg it's always forced by default.

Anyway, dropkey will indicate a failure if it's actually unable to drop the
content for some reason, eg a permissions problem or the content is locked
to prevent it being dropped right now, or other unanticipated error.
But, if the content of the key is not present, it's successfully
gotten the repo into the requested state.

Similarly, git-annex transferkey will return success if the key it was
supposed to download is already present.

I don't consider this a bug, although am willing to be convinced
otherwise..
