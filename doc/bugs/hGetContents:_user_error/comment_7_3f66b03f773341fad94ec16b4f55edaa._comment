Thanks for providing me an account.

I was able to reproduce the problem:

<pre>
$ git-annex-shell recvkey `pwd`
git-annex-shell: fd:6: hGetContents: user error (Pattern match failure in do expression at libraries/base/GHC/Event/Thread.hs:90:3-10)
</pre>

Here's another one:

<pre>
$ git annex init

git-annex: eventfd: unsupported operation (Function not implemented)
failed
init  
git-annex: fd:10: hGetContents: user error (Pattern match failure in do expression at libraries/base/GHC/Event/Thread.hs:90:3-10)
failed
</pre>

Aha! I found a more relevant bug in GHC's bug tracker. This has the same error message including the eventfd problem. <http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7926>

After some more digging around, it's definitely a kernel/glibc incompatability. I have filed a bug on glibc: <http://bugs.debian.org/715212>
