This special remote type rsyncs file contents to somewhere else.

Setup example:

	# git annex initremote myrsync type=rsync rsyncurl=rsync://rsync.example.com/myrsync encryption=joey@kitenet.net

## configuration

These parameters can be passed to `git annex initremote` to configure rsync:

* `encryption` - Required. Either "none" to disable encryption of content
  stored in rsync, 
  or a value that can be looked up (using gpg -k) to find a gpg encryption
  key that will be given access to the remote. Note that additional gpg
  keys can be given access to a remote by rerunning initremote with
  the new key id. See [[encryption]].

* `rsyncurl` - Required. This is the url or `hostname:/directory` to 
  pass to rsync to tell it where to store content.

The `annex-rsync-options` git configuration setting can be used to pass
parameters to rsync. Note that it is **not safe** to put "--delete"
in `annex-rsync-options` when using rsync special remotes.
