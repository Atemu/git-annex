@tomdhunt a few problems could result in this error message.

1. The .git/config file might not be readable by the web server, or some
   similar problem might cause the web server to fail to serve it.
   Just for example, a web server might be configured to not serve .git
   directories, since exposing them can sometimes be a mistake.
   The web server would have to fail with some problem other than a
   404 not found.. in that case there would be no error message.

2. git might somehow be failing to parse the .git/config file once it is
   downloaded. You would have to be running an older version of
   git-annex to get this error message in that situation though;
   recent versions display a different message if the config parse fails.

I think that's all the possibilities. To determine which it is, 
I suggest you download the .git/config file from the webserver yourself
(that would be `http://server.name/annex/.git/config` in your example),
and pass the downloaded file to `git config --list --file` to get git to
parse it, making sure git doesn't exit with an error.
