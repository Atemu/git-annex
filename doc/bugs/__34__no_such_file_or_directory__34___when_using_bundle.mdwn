### Please describe the problem.

The bundle provided at https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Linux_standalone/ doesn't work

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. I downloaded this file: https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz

2. I untared it in /usr/local and renamed the resulting directory to '/usr/local/git-annex'

3. I added '/usr/local/git-annex' to my PATH

4. I ran 'git-annex' and got:

mv: cannot move '/home/lyderic/.cache/git-annex/locales.tmp/ec977e22ef909b450a3a84bd55783865.1075139' to '/home/lyderic/.cache/git-annex/locales/ec977e22ef909b450a3a84bd55783865': No such file or directory

5. I fixed the problem by doing this:

$ mkdir ~/.cache/git-annex/locales

[[done]]

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 8.20200909-g2d5036e44
OS: Ubuntu 20.04.1

### Please provide any additional information below.

This is a transcript of the commands I ran to show and fix the bug:

[[!format sh """
~$ sudo tar -xzf Downloads/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local
~$ sudo mv /usr/local/git-annex.linux /usr/local/git-annex

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I have never used it. I am learning it / evaluating it right now. I am very impressed so far!
