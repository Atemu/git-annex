Does not seem to be the diff-filter=T command that is the problem. It's not outputting a lot of files, and should stream over them even if it did.

The last xargs appears to be at or near the problem. It is called by Annex.Content.saveState, which first does a Annex.Queue.flush, followed by a Annex.Branch.commit. I suspect the problem is the latter; at this point there are 2 million files in .git/annex/journal waiting to be committed to the git-annex branch.

In the same big repo, I can add one more file and reproduce the problem running `git annex add $newfile`.
