Somehow git-annex receives a truncated file from the web server,
so it is unable to parse it.

That only happens when using the haskell http library to download.
When git-annex is configured to use curl, it works.

So, workaround:

	git -c annex.security.allowed-http-addresses=all -c annex.web-options=-4 annex importfeed \
		https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/podcast-deutschlandfunk-der-tag.3417.de.podcast.xml

git-annex addurl downloads the complete file, so the problem does not
seem to be with the haskell http library, but something to do with how
importfeed is using it that causes a truncation.

Aha, importfeed uses withTmpFile, so the destination file exists with 0
size. This triggers a resume code path. And it looks to me like this web
server may not handle resume very well, it appears to send ~32kb
of data and not the whole file in that case.

So, the obvious fix is to not resume when the destination file is empty,
and I've done that.
