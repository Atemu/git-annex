git-annex 7.20191017 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * initremote: Added --sameas option, allows for two special remotes that
     access the same data store.
   * Note that due to complications of the sameas feature, any external
     special remotes that try to send SETSTATE or GETSTATE during INITREMOTE
     or EXPORTSUPPORTED will now get back an ERROR. That would be a very
     hackish thing for an external special remote to do, needing some kind
     of hard-coded key value to be used, so probably nothing will be affected.
   * forget --drop-dead: Remove several classes of git-annex log files
     when they become empty, further reducing the size of the git-annex branch.
   * OSX: Deal with symbolic link problem that caused git to not be included in
     the git-annex.dmg.
   * Fix build with persistent-2.10."""]]
