I followed this to re-inject files which git annex fsck listed as missing.

For everyone of those files, I get 

    git-annex-shell: key is already present in annex
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(601) [sender=3.0.8]

when trying to copy the files to the remote.
