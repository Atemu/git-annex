I'm using S3 special remote that I initialized like this:

    git annex initremote s3 type=S3 encryption=EEF2B390 datacenter="EU" storageclass="REDUCED_REDUNDANCY"

Instead of asking me my key passphrase (I have gpg-agent running), it ask me a new passphase an then repeat it. So it's not my passphrase because if I kill gpg-agent, it will ask me three passphrase for each file: one mine and two for the new one. If i don't put anything there it says:

    copy GOPR1672.JPG (checking s3...) (to s3...) gpg: error creating passphrase: Invalid passphrase
    gpg: symmetric encryption of `[stdin]' failed: Invalid passphrase
    failed
    git-annex: fd:13: hPutBuf: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
    copy GOPR1673.JPG (checking s3...) (to s3...) 

So I create a new passphrase (two times) for each file I tried to upload. The problem is that I have more than 12000 files to upload!

What's this new passphrase for?

BTW: git-annex version: 3.20130102 same precompiled binary on Arch Linux.
