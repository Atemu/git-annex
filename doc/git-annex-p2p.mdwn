# NAME

git-annex p2p - manage peer-to-peer connections

# SYNOPSIS

git annex p2p [options]

# DESCRIPTION

When using git-annex with peer-to-peer communication, this manages
connections between the peers.

Currently, git-annex supports peer-to-peer communication over Tor.

# OPTIONS

* `--gen-address [name]`

  Generates one or more addresses, which allow whoever knows them to access
  your repository. The addresses are output on standard output, one per
  supported P2P network.

  You can re-run this command repeatedly to generate as many addresses
  as you like.

  The name is an optional parameter, the name of the person or device you
  intend to give this address to. Providig it makes it easier to use
  `--remove-address`

* `--link-remote name address`

  Link the local repository to a remote repository. This sets up a git remote
  with the specified name. The address is one generated by `--gen-address`
  run on the remote repository.

* `--remove-address [address|name]`

  If you've given out an address to someone, and don't want to accept
  connections from them anymore, this can be used to remove it.
