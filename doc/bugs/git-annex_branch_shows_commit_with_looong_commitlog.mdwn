### Please describe the problem.

I have found a really weird commit in my git-annex branch:

    * a59dd1c update (il y a 8 heures) <Antoine Beaupré>
    * 57f887a update (recovery from race) (recovery from race) (recovery from race) [...]

it repeats that for a looong time. about 12 000 times, to be more precise:


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Now i have absolutely no idea how I managed that. I got through some pretty dark moments last night trying various levels of git-annex voodoo (including a duplicate repo which was rsync'd to a backup drive so the unique identifier applied to two distinct paths), so I have no idea exactly what happened here.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

debian jessie amd64 5.20140412

### Please provide any additional information below.

that's 80KB for only one commit here - maybe that should be cleaned up? --[[anarcat]]
