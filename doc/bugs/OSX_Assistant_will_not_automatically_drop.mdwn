### Please describe the problem.
I cannot reproduce the archive behaviour explained in the screencast: git annex assistant archiving.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Install the OSX dmg.  Open the webapp. Make a client repo `~/annex` on the laptop and a full archive repo `/Volumes/Seagate/annex` on an external hard drive. Disregard the errors in the webapp. Restart daemon. Finish configuration of the archive repo as full archive.
Put a test file in `~/annex`, watch it copy over in the webapp.  Verify copies with `git-annex whereis`.  
numcopies=1  
**Use the GUI to move the test file to `~/annex/archive`.  The file does not turn into a symlink as expected.**  
Run the command `git-annex drop --auto`.  the archived file is now replaced by a symlink.  `git annex whereis` verifies that the copy is only in the archive.
Now move the symlink back to `~/annex`. The symlink is not replaced by the file.
Restart the assistant using the webapp or with `git annex assistant --stop` `git annex assistant`.  The symlink is replaced by the file.  
Repeat above steps with the same effect.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
OSX 10.11.6 El Capitan

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
I have not used it before, but I'm determined to make it work!  I'm nomadic and archive my pictures/videos/files and therefore this software must be perfect for me!
