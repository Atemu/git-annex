Just using async is not enough, if thread A asyncs thread B which asyncs
thread C, and then A cancels B, that leaves C running.

withAsync avoids that problem. So around 30 calls to `async` need to be
converted. Also, any library that might use `async` would be a problem.

(Seems that `concurrently` and `race` also avoid the problem, being built on
withAsync.)

(Some uses of `async` do avoid the problem because the async thread exits
for some other reason when the outer thread is terminated. Eg,
Database.Handle auto-terminates its worker thread when the handle gets
garbage collected.)
