If you use the --jobs option, git-annex will actually balance load amoung
multiple remotes that have the same cost. Which will prevent everything
bottlenecking on a single repository.

Alternatively, configure the cost of the slow repository to be higher than
the other drives, and then things like `git annex get` will avoid using the
slow one if a faster one is available.
