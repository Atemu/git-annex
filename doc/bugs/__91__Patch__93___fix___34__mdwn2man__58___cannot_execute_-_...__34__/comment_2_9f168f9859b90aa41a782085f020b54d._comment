Thanks for the tip. (FYI: I'm working on packaging it for OpenBSD. Currently we just have a hack in place that manually runs the mdwn2man script after the cabal build. The Cabal packaging module it's built on probably isn't designed to call a Makefile but there may be some way to do it. In any case, it seems to work, so we might just leave it as is.)
