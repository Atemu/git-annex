The new version arrived in homebrew today. Thanks for adding the possibility to add GPG decrypt options. 
I added --no-tty to annex.gnupg-decrypt-options but unfortunately it is not picked up by gpg. This is the log after removing --no-tty from .gnupg/gpg.conf and only adding it to .git/config.

Unfortunately there is no upload happening but the status in the webapp is showing no error (everything green). Not sure if the error is actually coming from gcrypt and not git-annex?
