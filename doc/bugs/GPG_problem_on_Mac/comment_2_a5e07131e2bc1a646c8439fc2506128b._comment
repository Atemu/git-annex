Hi,

I have gpg installed.
[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ which gpg
/usr/local/bin/gpg
$ which gpg-agent
/usr/local/bin/gpg-agent
\"\"\"]]
(are there other \"programs\" besides gpg and gpg-agent I should check for?)

/usr/local/bin is part of my PATH.

I actually noticed some strange behavior now:

 * At some point I was able add the box.com repository to my original annex dir. (I think it was caused by calling gpg-agent on the command line, but I am unsure here.)
 * I created after a reboot then a second annex dir (annex2) (not connected to the first).
 * I was again not able to add a new box.com repository for this new annex (annex2) while the original annex dir is still able to sync to box.com

This seems to indicate that there is some annex specific configuration files influencing this gpg location problem.
