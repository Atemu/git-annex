It currently does not make reflinks. That should be relatively easy to fix.

Of course, if you can get the content into the git-annex repository by
other means like manual cp --reflink, git-annex will never have any reason
to transfer the imported file from the remote, so that workaround would
work.

Also, git-annex import from directory special remote changed fairly
recently to only hash the files and not get their contents. But an older
version would. Anyway, when the contents do eventually need to be copied
from it, the above still applies.
