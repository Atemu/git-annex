You mean between the \"git annex adjust\" and the \"git status\"? No, I did nothing at all :(.

After running \"git restore\" some files (but not all, it seems to be the first N files ordered alphabetically) are still marked as modified, some others get modified again after another \"git restore\"... Weird!
