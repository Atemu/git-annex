The intent in providing DIRHASH is to let external special remotes that
would like to do some hashing in their own backend storage get a value
that's suitable for that.

I guess you're instead trying to use it to let the external special remote
access data stored in .git/annex/objects in the local repositpry.
And DIRHASH won't work for that; it's not even the right hash method.
(Not to mention, in direct mode, the data may not be stored in
.git/annex/objects at all.)

If that's what you're looking for, I think that a new plumbing command
would be best. Something like `git annex contentlocation $KEY` outputting
a path to the content.
