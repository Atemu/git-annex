A git-annex repo consisting of annex symlinks (locked files) can be cloned
and used on machines running git-annex versions between 2 and 8. (Any
version from the past 9 years.) It's the same information stored in git.

If you choose to commit unlocked files to the repo, those files will only
work when using git-annex 7 or 8. But that's optional and you can also just
re-lock the files to regain compatability all the way back to version 2.

So, no, you do not need to worry about git-annex sync breaking something.

And, git-annex 8 on one machine can talk to git-annex 7 (or any version
really) on another machine, no problem.

Now, if you have a repo that you are physically moving around between
machines, on USB for example, then the machines all need have to have
a git-annex version installed that's compatible with the annex.version
of the repo.
