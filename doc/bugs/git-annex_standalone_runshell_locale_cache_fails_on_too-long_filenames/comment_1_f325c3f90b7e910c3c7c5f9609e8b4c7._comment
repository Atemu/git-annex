Pre-building it for all locales would add several hundred
megabytes to the download.

The over-long path is proving difficult to deal with; it seems it would
need to hash the path, but the system may not have a hash program
(this is used on linux systems without coreutils), and
programs from the bundle can't yet be safely run at this point.

Wouldn't you have had to put it in a directory path that's almost
4096 bytes deep for this to happen?
