Why doesn't the assistant use git-annex -c instead of setting up a
wrapper that can potentially break? Seems like one moving parts too
many...

I have removed the wrapper from the manpage, as it seems a little
annoying to setup manually for no real advantage that I can see. Note
that the double-quotes need to be quoted otherwise the public key is
completely ignored.
