That sounds just fine, but indeed my use case was a bare backup/transfer repository that is meant to always be only at the remote end of git-annex operations. So why not as well do a single commit after everything has been copied and journaled? That's what's done at the other end too, after all. Or, if commits are to be minimized, just stage the journal into the index before finishing, but don't commit it yet?

(I would actually prefer this mode of usage for other git-annex operations, too. In git you can add stuff little by little and commit them all in one go. In git-annex the add immediately creates a commit, which is unexpected and a bit annoying.)
