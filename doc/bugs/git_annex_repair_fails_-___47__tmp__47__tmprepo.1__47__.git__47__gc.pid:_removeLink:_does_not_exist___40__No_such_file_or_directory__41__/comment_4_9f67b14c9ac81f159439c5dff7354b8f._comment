So the auto gc was triggered by git fetch. I have made the repair code prevent that from happening. I expect that will solve the problem, so I am marking this bug as closed.

However, I don't understand really what could have caused it to try to remove the gc.pid file. I tried creating such a pid file manually after the fetch, and it didn't try to remove it.
