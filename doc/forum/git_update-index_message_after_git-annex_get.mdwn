After running `git-annex get` in an unlocked (adjusted) v8 repo with git-annex 8.20200330, I see:

And indeed, some of the files I just got show as new, others as modified.

Where can I find more information on what happened here?

How can I run the update-index command safely without listing hundreds of files? Can I just run it over the directories those files were copied to?

Would you consider adding an option to run the update-index automatically where needed?
