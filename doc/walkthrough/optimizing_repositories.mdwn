Once you have multiple repositories, and have perhaps configured numcopies,
any given file can have many more copies than is needed, or perhaps fewer
than you would like. Fsck can detect the latter problem, but there's another
command that can help deal with both problems.

The optimize subcommand either gets or drops file content, as needed,
to work toward meeting the configured numcopies setting.

	# git annex optimize
	get my_cool_big_file (from laptop...) ok
	drop other_file ok
	# git annex optimize --numcopies=2
	get other_file ok
