question: is ASYNC and parallel workers in annex share the `-J` somehow?  I.e. if I start `annex get -J3 .` it would create three workers and then possibly talk to special remote(s).  Special remotes then might announce support of ASYNC and accept multiple jobs.  Would it be 3 active jobs across all workers+async or it would be up to 3*3=9 active jobs if every worker supports ASYNC?
