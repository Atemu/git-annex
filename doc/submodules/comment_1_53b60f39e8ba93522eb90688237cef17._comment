Truly experimental.

1. Create a git repo, and add some git-annexed files to it.
2. Create another git repo, and make above git repo a submodule under it.
3. In the git repo in step 2, add some git-annexed files to it.
4. Create yet another git repo, and add to it the git repo in step 2 as a submodule.
5. In the git repo in step 4, do `git-annex init <some-name>'.

The symlink that is created will be wrong.
Even if you manually create a correct symlink, git-annex still fails to work.

Truly experimental. For now, I have to avoid using git-annex in submodules.
