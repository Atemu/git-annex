### Please describe the problem.

`git annex remotedaemon --help` claims that `--stop` is a valid option for stopping the remote daemon, but it results in:

```
git annex remotedaemon --stop
git-annex: --stop not implemented for remotedaemon
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at ./Command/RemoteDaemon.hs:24:32 in main:Command.RemoteDaemon
```

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

`git annex remotedaemon --stop`

Just `kill`ing it seems to do the job, however :-)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

7.20190912-g05bc37910 on openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap 15.0.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes for many years, just finally getting round to exploring the more advanced features :-)
