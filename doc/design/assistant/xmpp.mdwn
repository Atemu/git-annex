The git-annex assistant uses XMPP to communicate between peers that
cannot directly talk to one-another. A typical scenario is two users
who share a repository, that is stored in the [[cloud]].

### TODO

* Prevent idle disconnection. Probably means sending or receiving pings,
  but would prefer to avoid eg pinging every 60 seconds as some clients do.
* XMPP pairing
* git pushes over XMPP (needed for pairing, but also awesome on their own)

## design goals

1. Avoid user-visible messages. dvcs-autosync uses XMPP similarly, but
   sends user-visible messages. Avoiding user-visible messages lets
   the user configure git-annex to use his existing XMPP account
   (eg, Google Talk).

2. Send notifications to buddies. dvcs-autosync sends only self-messages,
   but that requires every node have the same XMPP account configured.
   git-annex should support that mode, but it should also send notifications
   to a user's buddies. (This will also allow for using XMPP for pairing
   in the future.)

3. Don't make account appear active. Just because git-annex is being an XMPP
   client, it doesn't mean that it wants to get chat messages, or make the
   user appear active when he's not using his chat program.

## protocol

To avoid relying on XMPP extensions, git-annex communicates
using presence messages (which always mark it as extended away),
and chat messages (with empty body tags, so clients don't display them).

To these messages, it adds its own tag as
[extended content](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html#presence-extended).
The xml namespace is "git-annex" (not an URL because I hate wasting bandwidth).

To indicate it's pushed changes to a git repo with a given UUID, a message
that should be sent to all buddies and other clients using the account (no
explicit pairing needed), it uses a broadcast presence message containing:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' push="uuid[,uuid...]" />

Multiple UUIDs can be listed when multiple clients were pushed. If the
git repo does not have a git-annex UUID, an empty string is used.

To query if other git-annex clients are around, a presence message is used,
containing:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' query="" />

For pairing, a chat message is sent, containing:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' pairing="PairReq|PairAck|PairDone uuid" />

### git push over XMPP

To indicate that we could push over XMPP, a chat message is sent,
to the accounts associated with known XMPP remotes.

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' canpush="" />

To request that a remote push to us, a chat message can be sent.

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' pushrequest="uuid" />

When replying to an xmpppush message, this is directed at the specific
client that indicated it could push. But it can also be sent to 
the account associated with an XMPP remote to solicit pushes from all clients.

When a peer is ready to send a git push, it sends:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' startingpush="uuid" />

If that's a response to a pushrequest, it'll be directed at only the client
that requested the push. If a push request is being initiated, it'll be sent
to the account assicated with the remote.

The receiver runs `git receive-pack`, and sends back its output in
one or more chat messages, directed to a specific client:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' rp="">
	007b27ca394d26a05d9b6beefa1b07da456caa2157d7 refs/heads/git-annex report-status delete-refs side-band-64k quiet ofs-delta
	</git-annex>

The sender replies with the data from `git push`, in 
one or more chat messages, directed to the receiver:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' sp="">
	data
	</git-annex>

When `git receive-pack` edits, the receiver indicates its exit
status with a chat message, directed at the sender:

	<git-annex xmlns='git-annex' rpdone="0" />

### security

Data git-annex sends over XMPP will be visible to the XMPP
account's buddies, to the XMPP server, and quite likely to other interested
parties. So it's important to consider the security exposure of using it.

Even if git-annex sends only a single bit notification, this lets attackers
know when the user is active and changing files. Although the assistant's other
syncing activities can somewhat mask this.

As soon as git-annex does anything unlike any other client, an attacker can
see how many clients are connected for a user, and fingerprint the ones
running git-annex, and determine how many clients are running git-annex.

If git-annex sent the UUID of the remote it pushed to, this would let
attackers determine how many different remotes are being used,
and map some of the connections between clients and remotes.

An attacker could replay push notification messages, reusing UUIDs it's
observed. This would make clients pull repeatedly, perhaps as a DOS.
