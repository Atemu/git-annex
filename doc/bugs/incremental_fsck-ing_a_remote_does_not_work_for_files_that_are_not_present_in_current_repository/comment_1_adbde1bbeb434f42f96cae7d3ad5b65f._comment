More recent versions of git-annex don't use the mtime hack, so avoid this
problem. I had not realized that was a benefit of ditching the mtime hack,
actually; it was done for other reasons like keeping separate incremental 
fscks of different remotes. 

I have verified that the problem does not exist with current versions.
