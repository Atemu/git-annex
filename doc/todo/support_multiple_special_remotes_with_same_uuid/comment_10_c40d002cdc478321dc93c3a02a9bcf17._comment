It might be possible to isolate the sameas changes only to things
involving the location log. Use different uuids for sameas
remotes. When updating the location log, substitute the sameas uuid.

There would need to be a sameas-aware way to check if a uuid is in the
location log. Currently, loggedLocations is used to both see what remotes
to try to get a key from, and for numcopies checking and related stuff
(like skipping dropping entirely when loggedLocations does not have enough
items in it). So there would need to be two variants of it. That seems
likely to be a source of mistakes.

Another small problem with this idea is that a special remote may record
its uuid somehow in the data store and check that it has the right uuid
later (S3 does this with an "annex-uuid" in the bucket), and if two remotes
with different uuids did that, there would be a conflict between them.

Also, it couldn't only be the location log; sameas mapping would also need
to be done when using the chunk log. And a bit of encryption config
inheritance would still be needed.
