It's looking for /etc/protocols. May be that termux provides the same
file in some other location.

It would be difficult to make the termux package use it if so, since it's
reusing git-annex that was compiled for a standard Linux system. I don't
think that libc provides a way to make getprotobyname read a different
file, other than `LD_PRELOAD` open hacks.
