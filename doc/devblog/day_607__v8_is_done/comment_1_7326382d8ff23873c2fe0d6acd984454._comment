If rebuilding the database is an operation that will take some time, it might be nice to have deprecation warnings in the web app before the assistant eventually autoupgrades repos.

I use the assistant/web app to manage about 10 repos, some of which are on the larger size both in terms of disk space and number of files. I suspect that if the assistant kicked off an upgrade with a database rebuild on all of these at once, it would have a noticeable performance impact on my machine. If, after v8 is merged but before the assistant autoupgrades, the web app displayed a message like \"This repository is using a version that will soon be upgraded, click here to learn more about v8 and consider upgrading\", it would give folks (who don't read the devblog or release notes) a heads up and give them a chance to manually upgrade repositories one by one.
