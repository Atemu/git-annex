Local pairing always sets up a dedicated ssh key that can only be used for git-annex syncing.

I'm afraid that, unless your login is literally \"user@host.fqdn\", you've obfuscated exactly the information I'd need to diagnose the problem. If you don't feel comfortable including the real information here you can mail it to me; see [[privacy]]

Also, you may want to file a new bug report, since I *did* fix and close this bug. You're probably seeing a slightly different bug.
