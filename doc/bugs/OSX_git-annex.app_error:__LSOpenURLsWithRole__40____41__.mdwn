**What steps will reproduce the problem?**

Either double click on the app or from the terminal

    $ open /Applications/git-annex.app

**What is the expected output? What do you see instead?**

I'd expect to see git-annex run.  "git-annex" doesn't run and what I see (in the terminal) is:

    LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/git-annex.app.

**What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?**

*git-annex*: 3.20121017

*git-annex.app*: ???

*OS*: OSX 10.6.8 64 bit


**Please provide any additional information below.**
