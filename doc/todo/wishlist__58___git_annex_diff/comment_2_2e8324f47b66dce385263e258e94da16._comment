I wrote a little shell script that implements part of this request. It shows the diff between an unlocked file and its locked version (i.e. the current edits that have not yet been annexed).
This only works in non-direct mode, and obviously with 'diffable' content only.

Usage is simple, the only parameter it requires is the unlocked filename.

    #!/bin/bash
    
    DIFF=\"diff\"
    FILE=\"$1\"
    KEY=$(git annex lookupkey \"$FILE\")
    
    GITPATH=\"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.git\"
    ANNEXPATH=$GITPATH/annex/objects/$(git annex examinekey --format='${hashdirmixed}${key}/${key}' \"$KEY\")
    
    if [ -L \"$FILE\" ]; then
      echo \"$FILE is not unlocked.\" > /dev/stderr
    else
      if [ -r \"$ANNEXPATH\" ]; then
        $DIFF \"$ANNEXPATH\" \"$FILE\"
      else
        echo \"Cannot find $ANNEXPATH\" > /dev/stderr
        exit 1
      fi
      exit 1
    fi
