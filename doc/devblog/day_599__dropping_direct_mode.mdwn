Wow, I did not plan to remove direct mode today! The original plan was to
work on [[todo/sqlite_database_improvements]]. But that seems to need a v8
repository format, to avoid confusing old git-annex with the new db schemas.
And to get to v8, we must first get to v7..

Removing direct mode eliminated over 1000 lines of code. I may be able to
remove a few hundred more yet.

Did find a bug with the upgrade process just as I was wrapping up for the
day, it's minor (involving a deleted file in the work tree), so I'll deal
with it tomorrow.
