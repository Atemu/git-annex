The goal is not to consider an object unused that some other remote is known to rely on. We try as hard as we can to avoid losing data, at the expense of possibly not dropping unused content as early as possible.

Running `git annex sync` or similar to get current with the state of all remotes before dropping objects they might still rely on seems reasonable from this perspective.
