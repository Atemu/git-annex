Usually, git-annex detects this situation and hides the error message
from the git push of master.

It only hides the error message if it mentions "denyCurrentBranch".
The usual error message in this situation does. I think there must be
something in the git configuration (on the remote) that does not.

Perhaps something to do with receive.denyCurrentBranch? Yes, it seems that
if it's set to "refuse", I get the same error.

It would be nice if git-annex could recognize that error and hide it too,
which I suppose would involve looking for
"refusing to update checked out branch", and probably would need git to be
run with localization disabled.

If you can unset receive.denyCurrentBranch in the remote's git config, it will 
avoid the problem for you..
