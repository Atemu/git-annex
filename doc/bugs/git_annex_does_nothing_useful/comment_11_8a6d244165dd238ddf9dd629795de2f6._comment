I suppose.. joey can probably help you investigate exactly what went wrong.  You might want to save an empty clone of the git repository for later..

The easiest way to fix the data is probably to run a `git annex uninit` in the old repository which will put the files back how they were before and then `git-annex import` them into a new repository.
