That catKey optimisation actually only helps if the tree has a lot of files
that are not annex symlinks, but are either unlocked or not annexed. 
If most of the files are locked, that would actually make the scan
somewhere around twice as slow as it currently is. So not a worthwhile
optimisation.

And I don't see much else there that could be optimised. Possibly the
ls-tree parser could be made faster but it's already using attoparsec
so unlikely to be many gains.
