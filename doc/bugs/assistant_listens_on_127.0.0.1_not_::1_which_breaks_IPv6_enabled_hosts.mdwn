What steps will reproduce the problem?

Using the Linux tarball (i386) with configured IPv6:

* git-annex.linux/git-annex-webapp

A browser is then started, pointing to file:///tmp/webapp313.html which in turn points to http://localhost:$port/$blah .

On my box localhost resolves to ::1, but the webapp is only listening on 127.0.0.1 so . While I can work around this by specifying 127.0.0.1 as the hostname, the next page that is loaded goes back to localhost. 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect that the webapp would bind to ::1 if possible.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20130102 fromt the Linux tarball release on Debian Squeeze.

Please provide any additional information below.

I've tested this with:

* epiphany
* iceweasel
* chromium

Iceweasel is the only one which correctly fell back to IPv4 and worked.
