If your Linux distribution does not have git-annex packaged up for you,
you can either build it [[fromscratch]], or you can use a handy
prebuilt tarball of the most recent release.

This tarball should work on most Linux systems. It does not depend
on anything except for glibc.

[download tarball](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/)

To use, just unpack the tarball, `cd git-annex.linux` and run `./runshell`
-- this sets up an environment where you can use `git annex`, as well
as everything else included in the bundle.

Alternatively, you can unpack the tarball, and add the directory to your
`PATH`. This lets you use `git annex`, without overriding your system's
own versions of git, etc.

Warning: This is a last resort. Most Linux users should instead
[[install]] git-annex from their distribution of choice.

## autobuilds

A daily build is also available.

## gitannex-install

Eskild Hustvedt has contributed a
[gitannex-install](https://github.com/zerodogg/scriptbucket/blob/master/gitannex-install)
script to manage keeping up to date with new releases using the standalone
built.
