OK. It looks like one way I could achieve this is by following these instructions [old method](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/publishing_your_files_to_the_public/old_method/). Basically just `git annex copy --to` the file to a public s3 repo without encryption and without chunking and with `public=yes` then grab the URL.

It seems this should also work for any remote that supports `WHEREIS Key` for getting a URL from any key.
