@yarikoptic, yes, the filename there is a git-annex branch filename.
So, .git/annex/index is where the problem lies in your case.

(Probably in the original bug reporter's case too; they trimmed out the
important part of the error message it seems. git fsck won't detect a
problem with .git/annex/index.)

The best thing to do in this case is to delete .git/annex/index,
since git-annex can always recover from that by creating a new one that
does not point to git objects that have mysteriously vanished from your
disk.

Since information that was being written to the git-annex branch has
apparently been lost, you'll also want to `git annex fsck --fast`
