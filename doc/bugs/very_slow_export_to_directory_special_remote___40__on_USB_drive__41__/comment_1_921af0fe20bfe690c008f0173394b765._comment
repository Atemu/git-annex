The directory special remote uses haskell's native ByteString library,
which tends to be easily capable of fully saturating IO on most systems.
The imposition of a meter by Utility.Metered does not change that
appreciably, it just uses a small amount of CPU time to update a counter 
and occasionally display progress.

ByteString uses a default 32kb chunk size, so if having the drive mounted sync
means it flushes the cache after every 32kb write, well there's your problem.

All your other questions have been discussed elsewhere on this website
AFAIK, and I'm not going to try to discuss all that here. Bug reports
should be about a single bug.
