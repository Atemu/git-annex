I'm not sure which program is doing the asking either.  The title bar says \"OpenSSH\".  It is asking for the SSH key password, but if I dismiss the dialog without entering the password, it will open another dialog asking for the user account's password, e.g. me@laptop, indicating it's SSH falling back to password auth.
