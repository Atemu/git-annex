I'm attempting to init this special remote with my Pixel 3a android phone (which connect via MTP) but keep hitting the following error.

In Debian, this will mount to /run , specifically in my case

/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp\\:host\=Google_Pixel_3a_94MBY/Internal\ shared\ storage/DCIM

git annex initremote android type=adb androiddirectory=/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp\\:host\=Google_Pixel_3a_94MBY/Internal\ shared\ storage/DCIM  encryption=none exporttree=yes importtree=yes
initremote android 
git-annex: adb: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: does not exist (No such file or directory)
failed
git-annex: initremote: 1 failed

I've tried enclosing the androiddirectory in single/double quotes (based on the hope that the colon before host was the issue)
I've also attempted to substitute a symbolic link to the directory instead - but no luck.

(*) I can cd  into this directroy via xterm and browse etc.

Thanks,
M
