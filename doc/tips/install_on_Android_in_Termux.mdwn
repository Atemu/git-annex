[Termux](https://termux.com/) is an Android app that can run some
Linux software in a terminal.

git-annex is not currently part of the Termux distribution, but it's easy
to install it. Paste these commands into Termux:

	pkg install git wget tar
	cd
	wget https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-armel.tar.gz
	tar zxf git-annex-standalone-armel.tar.gz
	rm git-annex-standalone-armel.tar.gz
	git-annex.linux/runshell

Now you can set up a git-annex repository or two, to manage your
Android files. Here we'll make one for camera photos.

	termux-setup-storage
	cd ~/storage/dcim
	git init
	git annex init

You can run the git-annex assistant in your repository, to automatically
notice new and changed files and commit them to the repository:

	cd ~/storage/dcim
	git annex assistant

You can set up a ssh remote pointing to a server, and the assistant will
automatically sync things up.

And so on. Most ways you would use git-annex on a Linux system work fairly
well in this Termux environment.

Known limitations:

* Direct mode

  git-annex will probably default to direct mode due to the
  limitations of Android's /sdcard. You can get around this using v6
  unlocked repositories, or by putting the git-annex repository on a better
  filesystem on the Android device, such as your termux home directory.

* Webapp

  The webapp doesn't know how to open a web browser on Android. It displays
  a `file://` url, and if you copy and paste that into a web browser, it
  will work.
