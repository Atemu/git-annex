### Please describe the problem.

*As of filing:* 

* [downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.11_El_Capitan/git-annex.dmg.info](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.11_El_Capitan/git-annex.dmg.info) contains: `distributionVersion = "8.20200618"` 
* whereas:  git-annex 8.20200720.1 (and 8.20200720) are the only versions published since 8.20200617. (There was no release matching 8.20200618) 

*Expected behavior:*

* `distributionVersion` and included `git-annex`'s version matches an announced released version

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. On macOS, download and deploy the current [git-annex.dmg](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.11_El_Capitan/git-annex.dmg)
2. Open a terminal session and enter `git-annex version`

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

[[!format sh """
git-annex version: 8.20200617-gd46490c17

$/usr/bin/sw_vers
 ProductName:	Mac OS X
 ProductVersion: 10.12.6
 BuildVersion:	16G2136
"""]]

### Please provide any additional information below.

* Assuming this is the same problem with the autobuilder described in [kite net OSX/current/ distribution is 7.20190913 but 7.20191009 expected](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/kite_net_OSX__47__current__47___distribution_is_7.20190913_but_7.20191009_expected/)
* Please give it a look and let us know when we have a distributionVersion matching release notes.  Would like to pickup the fixes described in 8.20200720(.1) news.


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Still rock solid maintaining the .dmgs and .pkgs for a 67GB [Munki](https://www.munki.org) repository.
