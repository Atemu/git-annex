`stop` does different things depending on the stage of a command that it's
used in.

In CommandStart, it quietly stops any further action.

In CommandPerform, it causes the command to fail,
which looks like "commandname actionitem failed".
If no other output is emitted to say why it failed,
this is not nice.

(It can't be used in CommandCleanup.)

It would be good to get rid of support for running `stop` in
CommandPerform. Simply change the type:

	- stop :: Annex (Maybe a)
	+ stop :: CommandStart

And follow the compile errors.
