`upgrade` will fail and leave the repo broken when run in a
v5 direct repo with annex.alwayscommit=false and not synced since the last
change.

> Forwarded from a private email to me, have not reproduced yet. --[[Joey]]

Update: Got a repo tarball sent to me that reproduces the problem. It looks like
this:

	git annex upgrade
	upgrade (v5 to v6...) 
	  caught exception: Somehow no branch is checked out
	<callstack>
	failed
	(recording state in git...)
	git-annex: upgrade: 1 failed

.git/HEAD points to refs/heads/annex/direct/master, 
but that ref does not actually exist yet.

The repo was created with git-annex 7.20190731-gbb16a2610
and this sequence of commands:

	git init .

	git config user.email "email@example.com"
	git config user.name "Name Name"
	git config annex.alwayscommit false
	git config annex.autoupgraderepository false
	git annex init foobar
	git annex direct
	echo "aaaa" > a && echo "bbbb" > b
	git annex add a b
	git annex drop --force a

Note that lack of git-annex sync, which is why the branch
never got created. The index file has the adds staged of course.

So, fixing this unusual case needs the upgrade code to go ahead and commit
the staged index first.
