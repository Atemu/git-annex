Actually the --force documentation re location tracking is not a good
description of the behavior. It only affects --from, and with --force
it still contacts the remote to check if it has the content. Only
if that check fails to return a result (ie, the remote can't be contacted),
does it assume that the remote has the content, rather than the default
behavior of falling back to looking at the location tracking information.

It's hard to see how that could be useful at all; if it fails in
communication with the remote, presumably the content transfer will later
fail as well.

The only actual behavior change would be when the remote cannot be
contacted, and the location tracking information says it does not contain a
file. Then `move --force --from remote` will fail, because it tries
to perform the move and can't contact the remote, while `move --from
remote` will succeed, because it assumes the location tracking is right.

That does not seem a useful distinction. And that was the behavior all the
way back to the first commit of this "feature" in 2013.

So, removing that.

----

There may be room for a new option that actually does whatever you were
hoping --force did. So let's talk about that..
