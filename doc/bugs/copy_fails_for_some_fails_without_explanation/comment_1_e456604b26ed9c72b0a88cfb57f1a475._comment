I tried git annex sync --content, and it failed to copy some files with

  git: createProcess: resource exhausted (Resource temporarily unavailable)

So this sounds like fork is failing; I'm probably exhausting my poor pi's RAM.  Maybe the same thing is happening for git annex copy.  I'll run strace to see.
