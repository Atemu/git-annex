Haskell programs actually cannot alter their process name. I've had a bug
open on ghc for a year about that.

However, I can make a nicer symlink name than ld-linux.so, and use that,
and it will then be clear what program is being run, although the
parameters to it will still be unusual due to the shimming used in the
standalone build.
