Looks like you have around 61396 files, which is not really very many. Is that guess accurate?

I have repositories with that many files, that do not run out of memory, or even use much memory at all when running `git annex status`. Just tried and it needed 15 mb, not 900.

Since you're using Ubuntu precise with a current version of git-annex, I'll bet you installed from fmarier's PPA. Is that right?

In case this is a problem only with the build in the PPA, can you please download the [[/install/Linux_standalone]] tarball, and try the same command using the git-annex from there?
