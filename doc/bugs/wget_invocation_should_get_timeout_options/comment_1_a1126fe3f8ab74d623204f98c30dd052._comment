Well, if any operation that gets a file stalls for some reason, then yes,
everything stalls.

wget has various options like --read-timeout, but I don't see how git-annex
could guess at sane defaults to use for those. If there are sane defaults
for those options, wget probably already implements them. Indeed,
it seems it already defaults --read-timeout to 900 seconds.

You can of course pass such options if you want to.

So, I'm not clear what's being asked for here, or how it's a bug in
git-annex at all.
