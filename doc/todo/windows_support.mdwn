The git-annex Windows port is not ready for prime time. But it does exist
now! --[[Joey]] 

## status

* Does not work with Cygwin's build of git (that git does not consistently
  support use of DOS style paths, which git-annex uses on Windows). 
  Must use the upstream build of git for Windows.
* rsync special remotes are known buggy.
* Bad file locking, it's probably not safe to run more than one git-annex
  process at the same time on Windows.
* Ssh connection caching does not work on Windows, so `git annex get`
  has to connect twice to the remote system over ssh per file, which
  is much slower than on systems supporting connection caching.
* Webapp doesn't build yet.
* `git annex watch` builds, but does not quite work.
* `git annex assistant` builds, but has not been tested, and is known
  to not download any files. (transferrer doesn't built yet)
* watch and assistant cannot be built with cabal. Possibly due to too many
  files overflowing command line length limit at link stage.
  To build a binary with them: 
  `ghc --make git-annex.hs -threaded -XPackageImports -DWITH_ASSISTANT=1 -DWITH_WIN32NOTIFY=1`
  (should add all the other flags cabal uses)
