I'd say around 50% of the files are reported as modified by \"git status\".

`git --no-pager diff --cached --output git-annex-cached-diff.diff` returns
instantly, with no output and nothing in `git-annex-cached-diff.diff`.
`git --no-pager diff --output git-annex-diff.diff` ran for around 5 hours, with no output and nothing in `git-annex-diff.diff`.
