I've implemented the race protection. Pretty sure this fixes it, at least
to the extent it can be fixed if it's a gpg bug that any 2 concurrent
password prompts can sometimes trigger. I'll run git-annex fsck in a
loop for an hour or so to be more sure.

It would be nice if someone wants to file a bug on gpg, but I don't have
time right now.
