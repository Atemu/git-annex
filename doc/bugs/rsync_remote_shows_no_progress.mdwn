What steps will reproduce the problem?
Init a annex, add rsync remote (with or without encryption, does not matter), launch annex assistant

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
In the dashboard, no progress is recorded for the transfer. Each file stays at 0% and then disappears as it is fully transfered. I expect the progressbar to move and show the actual transfer progress.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git head of today, Ubuntu 12.04

Please provide any additional information below.
I looked in the source code and found some hints that the rsync progress should actually be evaluated and shown, I'm opening a bug report for this reason.
