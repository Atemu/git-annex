A [DataLad issue](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/4795) was
raised about users inadvertently corrupting locked files.  That led to
an example where a user could copy corrupted content over to a special
remote, and the content isn't flagged until a `get` call.  (A slightly
different example, based on a directory remote and without
`exporttree=yes`, is included below.)

In the case of a regular remote, the `copy` call would fail earlier
with

```
  verification of content failed

  failed to send content to remote


  verification of content failed

  failed to send content to remote
failed
git-annex: copy: 1 failed
```

Should something similar happen when copying or exporting to a special
remote?  Perhaps verification before transfer to a special remote
isn't worth it, but the successful transfer surprised me given the
behavior when transferring to regular remotes.
