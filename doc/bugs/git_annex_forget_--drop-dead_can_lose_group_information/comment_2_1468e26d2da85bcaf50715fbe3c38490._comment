If you lost things from the git-annex branch due this bug, 
you can find the commit that contained them by `git log git-annex`,
and look for the commit before the "continuing transition" commit.

It's then possible to get those changes applied back to the git-annex
brannch; there should be no permanent data loss due to this bug.

Eg, here the commit that contained the lost group change was
261d1be6a2093f1e4059ed3030016c365f29413f. To get that back into the
git-annex branch, I ran:

	git update-ref git-annex 261d1be6a2093f1e4059ed3030016c365f29413f
	git annex merge
