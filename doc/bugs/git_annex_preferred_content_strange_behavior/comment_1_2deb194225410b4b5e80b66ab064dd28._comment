Interesting, I reproduce this.

I'd actually have expected the first copy to also
succeed; since B has no preferred content set it should want everything by
default.

I'm guessing that the weirdness of changing the behavior
comes from git-annex switching from the state where there
is no preferred content log to the state where there is one.

Seems it follows that it's using different defaults when there is
a preferred content log vs when there's not.

Will need to dig into this.
