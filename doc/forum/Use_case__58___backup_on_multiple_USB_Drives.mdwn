Hello, I have a question about my tipical use case.

I have a laptop with limited ssd space, 3 USB disks and I want to keep them in sync without using my laptop space.

I specify:
I want
/media/disk1/Backup
/media/disk2/Backup
/media/disk3/Backup
to be identical and synced, I can connect all the 3 drives to my laptop when I want to sync.
Usually I add a batch of photos from the pc to one of the disk and git annex sync the files for me.

BUT...

In my future-proof environment I really prefer to have my files stored in "direct" mode in all of the 3 repositories, is this possible?
So if something bad will happen I can just plug the disk in a brand new laptop and access my backup.

How can I achieve this result?
Thank you for your help
