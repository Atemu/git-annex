proot would only change the view of programs launched under it. I could probably do that (if git annex works under proot on the tablet in question at all; [[I had to disable it|tips/install_on_Android_in_Termux/#comment-48d995d39f783b4c59b1a2a66b387b55]] to get it running on Android 7.1 (compatible; LineageOS 14.1)).
