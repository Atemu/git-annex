I did not ask "Do you see git-annex displaying
multiple concurrent actions at the same time" in this bug report. I asked
it in an apparently unrelated bug report, 
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/git-annex-move_not_using_parallelism__63__/>
Please follow up on that question where I asked it, not here.

And you didn't answer the other question that I did ask in this bug report:
Do you have multiple files in the repository that point to the same key?
