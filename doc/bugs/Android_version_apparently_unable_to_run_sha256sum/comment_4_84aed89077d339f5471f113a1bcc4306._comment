Did a previous version of git-annex work with this particular Android variant before?

Try: `/data/data/ga.androidterm/bin/busybox --install -s /data/data/ga.androidterm/bin`

That should make symlinks, rather than hardlinks. It seems that the policy is somehow denying creation of hard links, but allowing symlinks.
