The assistant's log file is stored in `.git/annex/daemon.log` within the git repository.

I have to say I don't really understand the bug report. In one sentence you say the \"interface hangs forever\", and then in the next sentence you say you can \"still use the UI by clicking around\". These statements contradict one-another.

(@saironiq, I don't see any connection between what you're saying and pradermecker's bug report. If you have a bug to report, you should file a separate bug report.)
