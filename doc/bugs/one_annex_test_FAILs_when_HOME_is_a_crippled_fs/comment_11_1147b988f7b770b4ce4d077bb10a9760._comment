git-annex smudge is locking the git queue in order to run
restagePointerFile.

And of course, restagePointerFile has run git update-index, which has run
git-annex smudge.

Normally git-annex smudge avoids this loop. In this case, 
Database.Keys.reconcileStaged is what calls restagePointerFile
(for reasons explained in [[!commit 50fa17aee64ae778eb071cc21d5be85ce969bd9b]]).
So, there needs to be something to prevent restagePointerFile from running
in git-annex smudge, no matter how it's called.

Also, I suspect that vfat's timestamp granularity is exposing the problem.
On other filesystems, I don't see git-annex smudge calling restagePointerFile.
