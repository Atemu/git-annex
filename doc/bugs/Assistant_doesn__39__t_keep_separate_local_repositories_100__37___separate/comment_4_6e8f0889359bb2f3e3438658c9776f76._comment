No, I haven't configured XMPP yet.

I just tried something else:

Within assistant I've switched to repository ~bar and then added another repository ~/foobar and again selected keep the repositories separate.

The result is, ~/bar knows (vicfg) about ~/foobar, but ~/foo doesn't. It seems to me, that when adding another local repository, the new repository gets known to the currently selected repository.
