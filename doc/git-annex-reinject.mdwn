# NAME

git-annex reinject - sets content of annexed file

# SYNOPSIS

git annex reinject `src dest`

# DESCRIPTION

Moves the src file into the annex as the content of the dest file,
which should be an already annexed file whose content is not present.

This can be useful if you have obtained the content of a file from
elsewhere and want to put it in the local annex.

Verifies that the src file's content matches with the content that the dest
file is expected to have, and refuses to reinject it otherwise.

Example:

	git annex reinject /tmp/foo.iso foo.iso
