No there is no directory created on box.com. I have actually tried with other names without success. I did even try to create the directory myself and use this one but it makes no difference.

I am not sure to understand what 443 means.

To be sure it is not a local config problem on my computer, I have tried to put a file to box using cadaver: cadaver works just fine (create dir, upload, delete file).

After your comment, I actually rebuild the package using master. I still have the same error with WebDav but now all tests pass (git annex test)

Let me know if you need me to do further investigation. Thanks.
