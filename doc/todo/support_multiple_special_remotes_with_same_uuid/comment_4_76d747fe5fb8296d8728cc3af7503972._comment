The RemoteConfig is generated each run from the remote.log, and so the
handling of sameas remotes needs to be done in Logs.Remote.readRemoteLog
not by enableremote.

Logs.Remote.configSet will need some changes because it currently works
on the basis of UUID, and so can't know when it's supposed to change a
sameas remote. It seems it should instead work on the basis of the "name"
field of the RemoteConfig.
