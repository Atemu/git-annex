Could there be some point release to facilitate Windows getting a version with not broken dependency?  We are still experiencing tests failures while installing/using [https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/git-annex-installer.exe](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/git-annex-installer.exe) which reports git annex 
7.20190709-g15a972dd3.  Ref: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mih/datalad/builds/26646252/job/yvrb8hxqjo4ly6v1
