@Dominik, thanks for the links. Now that the webapp handles prompting for ssh passwords, the console is entirely vestigial and I'd like to get rid of it. The sc commands seems possible to use; there are also haskell libraries for building windows services.

The tricky part is that multiple git-annex assistant processes can be running, if there are multiple local repositories. This seems to be hard to do as a service.
