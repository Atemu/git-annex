Candyangel, you missed this part of my comment:

> But `mv foo bar; git add bar` is normally identical to `git mv foo bar`.

With locked files, that identity still holds; you can mv a symlink and git
add it, and you again have an annexed file. So every git and git-annex
repository has always behaved that way. There are innumerable workflows and
documentation that depend on that, in big or small ways.
