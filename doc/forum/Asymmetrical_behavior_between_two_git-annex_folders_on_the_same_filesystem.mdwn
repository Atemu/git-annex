On a shared workstation / server, I have the following directories:

```
~thing1/Projects/BerkeleyX
~thing2/BerkeleyX
```

`git annex list` works fine as `thing1` from the repo in `~thing2`. But the reverse demands the password for the SSH key coming from `~thing2` as `thing2`.

More specifically the following "Just Works (tm)":

```
sudo su dav
cd ~/Projects/BerkeleyX
git annex list
```

but the following asks for an SSH key password, and then doesn't work.

```
sudo su dillon
cd ~/BerkeleyX
git annex list
```
