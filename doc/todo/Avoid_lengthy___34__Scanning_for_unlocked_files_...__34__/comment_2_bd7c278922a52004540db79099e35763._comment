On a related note, maybe some way to [not install git-annex's clean/smudge filter when all annexed files are locked](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/only_pass_unlocked_files_through_the_clean__47__smudge_filter/) could be found?  Maybe, a flag could be stored on the git-annex branch to indicate that a repo is locked-files-only?  My repos often are.  Or maybe a flag in .gitattributes could indicate this.
