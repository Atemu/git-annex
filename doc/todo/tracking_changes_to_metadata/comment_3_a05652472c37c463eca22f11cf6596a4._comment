While git-annex does now let annex.commitmessage be set to specify
a commit message, it seems to me that you could include your reason for the
metadata value as yet more metadata. Ie:

	annex metadata -s 'NowPlaying-=machinename' -s 'message=This already exists on Artist - Album'

And a metadata log display would then naturally include those messages next
to the change they describe.
