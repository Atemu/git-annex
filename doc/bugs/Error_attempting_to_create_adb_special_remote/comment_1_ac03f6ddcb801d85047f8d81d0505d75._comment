Your phone is being mounted with mtp. That is not the protocol used by the
adb special remote.

The androiddirectory parameter cannot be used to specify a path on
your local computer. I think the documentation of that parameter is clear
about that?

You seem to not have the adb command installed, based on the error message.
If you install it and follow the documentation, I'd expect it will work.

Or, since the phone is already getting mounted by mtp, you can, instead of
making an adb special remote, simply make a 
[directory special remote](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/directory/)
