See [[forum/unannex_alternatives]] for problem description.

If an unannex is followed by a "git add; git commit", git-annex's hook thinks
that you have used git annex unlock on the file and are
now committing a changed version, and the right thing to do there is to add the
new content to the annex and update the symlink accordingly.

Can we tell the difference between an unannexed file that has yet to be committed
and an unlocked file? --[[Joey||
