All right, I see the same thing with linux 3.1.0. It seems this behavior has changed since linux 3.0.0. Mounting with shortname=lower avoids the problem. 

I feel a good case could be made that this new behavior is a linux bug. Your example with touch particularly shows how weird it is.

<pre>
$ touch Foo
$ echo hi > foo
sh: cannot create foo: File exists
$ rm foo
rm: cannot remove `foo': No such file or directory
</pre>
