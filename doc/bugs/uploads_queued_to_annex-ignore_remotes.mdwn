## What steps will reproduce the problem?

After the assistant idles for a while, it queues many transfers to remotes configured annex-ignore=true

##What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

No attempts to upload to repos marked 'annex-ignore=true'

Instead I see many queued transfers to the remote 'origin'
