Okay I managed to package the autobuild for my Arch system and installed. Here is what I get, retrieving finished glacier retrieval jobs which was started yesterday:

Without AWS credentials as environment variables, the call fails:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
[ben@voyagerS9 annextest]$ git annex get --from=glacier mydir/myfile1

I patched the glacier-cli Python source so that it prints out the command arguments argv.
The archive _does_ exist. Executing the glacier-cli command manually is successful. So is calling
git-annex with AWS credentials exported into env:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
[ben@voyagerS9 annextest]$ git annex get --from=glacier mydir/myfile2
get mydir/myfile2 (from glacier...) (gpg)
['/usr/local/bin/glacier', '--region=us-east-1', 'archive', 'retrieve', '-o-', 'glacier-myvault', 'GPGHMACSHA1--c3827c03d48b4829c7cc584778652c66e2784b0f']
ok
(Recording state in git...)

So I guess one bug is fixed, although I think there is a wrong error message.

Regarding AWS credentials, I have no success in updating credentials or finding out which if any are embedded:

When I checkout the git-annex branch and look into the remote.log I see fields for cipher, cipherkeys, datacenter, embedcreds=yes, name, s3creds, type, vault, timestamp.
The s3creds field does not look like my current AWS credentials, at least not in plaintext.
