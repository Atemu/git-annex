This code path should only be called when USERPROFILE or
one of USERNAME/USER/LOGNAME is not set. Which should not usually be the case
when using git-annex on windows.

However, since we know that won't work on Windows it might as well not even
try.. So I've made it instead print an error that indicates which
environment variables need to be set.

Can you please download the windows daily build from 
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/windows>, and see what this new,
better error message says?
