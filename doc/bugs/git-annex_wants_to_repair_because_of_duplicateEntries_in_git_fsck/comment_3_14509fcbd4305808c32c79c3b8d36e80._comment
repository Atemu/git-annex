hmm, so tree 3818a8ea201197ed355aa87133a718afca7c4a49 has 2 Dokument
entries. Interesting.

If you still have that repo, it would be interesting to compare trees
cd854aba649cee8855ec72579f4c98100471f7cf and 1ae499997746c8e976cf02edc2276532978dafc5

[[git_fsck_duplicateEntries_errors_when_using_adjusted_branch]] dates
from 2018, so I think I was right about my guess that it was something
about adjusted branches that led to this. I'll merge this bug into that
one.
