I was trying to undo some changes from another bare repo, and then all of a sudden the three letter directories popped up.  I think the way I did this was to hard reset the master and git-annex branches to the same commit.  I take it that was the wrong thing to do?  I take it the git-annex and master branch should never be merged?
