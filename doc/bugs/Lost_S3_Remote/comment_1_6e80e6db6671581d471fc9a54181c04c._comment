Despite `status` listing S3 support, your git-annex is actually built with S3stub, probably because it failed to find the necessary S3 module at build time. Rebuild git-annex and watch closely, you'll see \"** building without S3 support\". Look above that for the error and fix it.

It was certianly a bug that it showed S3 as supported when built without it. I've fixed that.
