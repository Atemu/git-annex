I also struggle with these issues on macOS.

One workaround would be to always use [unlocked files](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/unlocked_files/), 

    git config annex.addunlocked true

The main disadvantage here is that you use double the disk space for every file. After switching to unlocked files you could then also switch to `thin` mode:

    git config annex.thin true
    git annex fix

Which would only keep 1 copy of every file (using hardlinks), so you are back down to a normal amount of disk space, but you give up some of the protections of git-annex since you could easily delete the only copy of your files.

I have verified that using unlocked files and using unlocked-thin both fix file names in Preview and mail attachments. I'm not sure if both these methods allow files to be indexed by Spotlight.

I have also been hoping to integrate many of these features into [git-annex-turtle](https://github.com/andrewringler/git-annex-turtle) using the [Search and Spotlight](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/system-capabilities/search-and-spotlight/) developer APIs. Namely [Core Spotlight](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corespotlight) could be used to index all `git-annex` locked/unlocked/present/not-present files and [Quick Look](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/system-capabilities/quick-look/) APIs could be used to allow previewing of not present files using cached thumbnails.
