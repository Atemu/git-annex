That was really quick, thanks. I had no idea that the E in SHA256E stands for adding extensions. That makes the fix much easier, and much neater than adding spaces to filenames. Although it does make me wonder, what's the advantage of having the file extension in the key?

And yes, the python glacier-cli is failing with:

I'll open an issue in their GitHub in a moment since now I can give them some more context. Cheers!
