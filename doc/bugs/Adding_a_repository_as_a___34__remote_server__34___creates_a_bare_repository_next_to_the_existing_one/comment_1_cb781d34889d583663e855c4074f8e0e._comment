From what I understand, this happens when the assistant can't use git-annex-shell on the remote SSH server, as I have the same problem. The workaround I used was adding the remote SSH manually:

    git remote add ssh://server/path/to/repo

which the assistant recognises and uses properly.

The actual fix is, obviously, get git-annex-shell working. A likely reason it is missing is that because the SSH connection the assistant uses is not interactive, git-annex-shell is not in $PATH.

I think Joey's recommendation ([per our discussion here](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Can__39__t_access_files_from___39__Removable_drive__39___repo_even_if_set_as_client/#comment-8234271642283b51e173e20e217de3fc)) was to use local or XMPP pairing instead.
