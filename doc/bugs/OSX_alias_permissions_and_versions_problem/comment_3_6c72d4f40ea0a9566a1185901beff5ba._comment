Ok, so it seems  Sharebox solves all this problems...you might want to integrate sharebox into the assistant, so non-techie people can treat the repos as mutable.
Maybe make a mutable/unmutable toggle in the gui or somethink like that?

What I don't understand is the need for kqueue, if the files are not supposed to be written to without unlocking, why not use FSEvents and only monitor the folders for new files.
