### Please describe the problem.
On Windows, attempting to annex get from a remote over HTTP fails. URLs which are nearly correct, but have incorrect slashes, are sent.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create an annex on Linux.
2. Configure repository for HTTP access
3. Clone annex on Windows.
4. "git annex get ."
5. git annex makes requests for urls like the following: http://host/repo/.git/annex/objects\<3-char-hash>\<3-char-hash>\SHA<file hash>

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Windows 7: 4.20140627-g8a36ec5 (from the git-annex download page)

Debian Linux: 3.20120629 (from the package manager)

### Please provide any additional information below.
placing a wrapper script in front of wget which replaces '\' with '/' works around the issue, and allows git annex get to complete.
