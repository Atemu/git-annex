### Please describe the problem.
Using the incremental fsck starts from the beginning over and over again. Currently, it's not possible to check a repo in smaller steps.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Start an incremental fsck: `git-annex fsck -S`

Abort the operation either by `Ctrl+C` or `--time-limit=1s`

Continue the incremental fsck: `git-annex fsck -m`

or try this test script: https://gist.github.com/parhuzamos/a72236e24a83bdee5830

The check starts with same file as the first time and takes the same files again.
