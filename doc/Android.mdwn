git-annex is now available for Android. This includes the 
[[git-annex assistant|/assistant]], for easy syncing between your Android
and other devices.

[[Android installation instructions|/install/android]]

When you run the git-annex Android app, two windows will open. The first is
a terminal window, and the second is a web browser showing the git-annex
webapp.

## using the webapp

You can use the webapp on Android much the same as on any other
operating system, to set up the git-annex assistant.

The repository created by the webapp on your Android device is configured,
by default, as a "source" repository. This way, when you create a file on
Android (by, for example, taking a picture), it will be uploaded from your
Android device, and then its content removed from the device. This saves
storage space.

If you want to send files to your Android, and use them there, you should
edit the repository's configuration, and select "client". Bear in mind that
this will make it try to get every file placed in your repository on any
other computer, which might take up a lot of space.

## closing and reopening the webapp

The webapp does not need to be left open after you've set up your
repository. As long as the terminal window is left open, git-annex will
remain running and sync your files. To re-open the webapp after closing it,
click on the + icon in the terminal window.

## starting git-annex

The app is not currently automatically started on boot, so you will need to
manually open it to keep your files in sync. You do not need to leave the
app running all the time, though. It will sync back up automatically when
started.

## stopping git-annex

Simply close the terminal window to stop git-annex from running.

## using the command line

If you prefer to use `git-annex` at the command line, you can do so using the
terminal. A fairly full set of tools is provided, including `git`, `ssh`,
`rsync`, and `gpg`.

To prevent the webapp from being automatically started
when a terminal window opens, go into the terminal preferences, to "Inital
Command", and clear out the default `git annex webapp &` setting.

Or, if you'd like to run the assistant automatically, but not open the
webapp, change the "Initial Command" to: `git annex assistant --autostart`
