I'm using make and a 64bit version of haskell-platform, it's fine on the master branch. It's just crashing on the assistant branch, I'm just thinking out loud, but could I share the binaries that I have with you (I'd like to grab your binaries too) to see see if its just some silly problem with my build environment.

I'm seeing the crash when I'm running git-annex (in haskell), when I run libkqueue in a debugger it behaves randomly, is mostly succeeds, but every so often it fails. A back trace reveals nothing so I am a bit at a loss.

I've tried disabling the threaded option, but it still crashes, I will give it another try later when I get home. The problem seems to occur on my desktop mac in work and my home mac, however it is fine on my linux machines.

Could I ask which version of OSX do you have access to? is it 10.6 or 10.7 ?
