Hi,

I am new to git-annex.
I want to add glacier remote but when I run below command I am waiting but not happening anything.

`````
$ git annex initremote glacier type=glacier keyid=51764191 datacenter=eu-west-1
initremote glacier (encryption setup)
`````

I tried to add google drive as remote but same thing happening.

What I am doing wrong?

Should I add glacier support to git-annex before adding as remote? How?
