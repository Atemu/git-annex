I have not tried to upgrade, but I fixed it using annex describe followed by assistant restart as hinted in /usr/share/doc/git-annex/html/bugs/uuid.log_trust.log_and_remote.log_merge_wackiness.html.

From that document I understood that at worst it should use one of the two uuids (from Ubuntu or Gentoo repo), but it should not leave it without uuid and hence this report.

I have tried it a couple of times and it is perfectly reproducible.
