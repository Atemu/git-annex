add a git annex fsck that finds keys that have no referring file

(done)

* Need per-backend fsck support. sha1 can checksum all files in the annex.
  WORM can check filesize.

* Both can check that annex.numcopies is satisfied. Probably only
  querying the locationlog, not doing an online verification.
