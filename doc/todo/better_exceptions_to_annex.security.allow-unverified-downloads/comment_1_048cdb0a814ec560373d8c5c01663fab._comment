Added a per-remote configuration of that.

I thought about adding something to the external special remote protocol
to let them indicate what they are not vulnerable to CVE-2018-10857.
But it only affects WORM and URL keys, which I'm reluctant to complicate the
protocol for. (It would be better perhaps to just remove those types of
keys.) And it's actually rather difficult for external special
remote authors to guarantee that is the case, since libraries they use may
change over time.
