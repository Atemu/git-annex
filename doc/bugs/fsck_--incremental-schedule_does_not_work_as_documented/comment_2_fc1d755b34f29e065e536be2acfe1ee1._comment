I think you are right. I did try it out on the mac and Thought that I could see the same problems there. Today I tried to reproduce it, but it seems to be working correctly. (I have only tested it properly on a special remote, with --from,  and not on the repo itself, since I by misstake did start a job that fsck-ed all files with a new due date in 30 days. 

Please close the bug.
