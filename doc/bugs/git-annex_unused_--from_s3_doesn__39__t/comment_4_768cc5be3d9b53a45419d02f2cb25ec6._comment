Analysis: To find the keys, it's using git ls-tree git-annex. When this is
run in a subdirectory, it only lists files in the branch located under that
subdirectory. Which is no files. It should pass --full-tree to avoid that
problem.

Pretty much everywhere git-annex uses ls-tree, it does pass --full-tree.
But not in this particular case. Anything using Annex.Branch.branchFiles or
Annex.Branch.files would be affected; that's limited to git-annex unused
and code that runs transitions. git-annex unused w/o --from could also be
affected, I think, perhaps it's harder to trigger that though.
