It's not limited to git-annex sync, running import followed by merge and
then export shows the same behavior on the 3rd run. Without the export step, 
the bug doesn't happen.

The problem actually is in the second pass, the import is ok, but then the
export sets the remote tracking branch to only contain the subdirectory.
Then in the third pass that bad basis is used by the import (which does
nothing) and gets merged.

Why does only the second export trigger the bug, not the first?
Has to do with makeRemoteTrackingBranchMergeCommit and the shape of the
commit history.

Indeed, 7.20190322 doesn't have this bug, it was introduced in
the newest release which added makeRemoteTrackingBranchMergeCommit.
The export code accidentially passed a tree to that.
