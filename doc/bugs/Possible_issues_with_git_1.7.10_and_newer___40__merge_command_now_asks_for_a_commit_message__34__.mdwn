running 'git annex sync' doesn't merge the branches as expected (from the
limited testing I have done) with git 1.7.10, the behaviour of merge has
changed, it now asks for a commit message. I would expect setting
_GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT=no_ should resolve this issue.

I had to manually do a merge (or set that variable) to get the branches
back in sync again, this confused me a bit when git-annex watch was running
in the background on a remote and it did not pick up the changes.
