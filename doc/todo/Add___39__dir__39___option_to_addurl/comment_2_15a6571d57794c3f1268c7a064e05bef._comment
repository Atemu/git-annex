I was hoping something like tar's *-C*, or unzip's *-d* options would be easy to implement, given that git-annex will already create required directories when using --pathdepth. As far as I can tell, you can't mix --file and --pathdepth.. I'd have to reimplemnt --pathdepth and the directory creation in my script, which while not a major problem in Perl (aside from reinventing a potentially inferior wheel), may be if someone is using shell scripting.

Maybe this request can be more generalised to *--prefix*?

Then people could use --prefix to either just prefix the filename or set a directory for it to be put into. I had a look at Command/AddUrl.hs to see how feasible that would be but I'm struggling to follow it (not knowing Haskell yet).

In the meantime(?), I have made my script remember the original directory it was started in and it cd's about as needed.
