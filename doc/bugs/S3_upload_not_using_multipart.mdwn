I am trying to 'git annex copy large_file.tgz --to cloud' where cloud is an Amazon S3 remote.  My file is 7.4G as reported by 'ls'.  The output of the operation is...

    copy large-file.tgz (gpg) (checking cloud...) (to cloud...) Reading passphrase from file descriptor 12    


     Your proposed upload exceeds the maximum allowed size
     failed
     git-annex: copy: 1 failed

Looks like git-annex may not be using the Multipart Upload API: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html

Here is some output from my local client that may be helpful.
