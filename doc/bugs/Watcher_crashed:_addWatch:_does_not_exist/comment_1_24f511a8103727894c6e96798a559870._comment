Are you seeing this every time you start the webapp? Because I see a way it could crash, but only if, for example, a directory gets moved or deleted right when it's starting up. That would look just like the crash you've reported, but would seem to be an unusual case that would be unlikely to happen repeatedly.

I've put in a fix for that crash.
