I cannot reproduce this. I made sure to unset `GPG_AGENT_INFO` so gpg would need to prompt for a password on the terminal, and it did.

<pre>
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>unset GPG_AGENT_INFO 
joey@darkstar:~/tmp/r>git annex copy --to remote
copy n/xxx (gpg) 
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: \"Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>\"
4096-bit RSA key, ID 17065459, created 2009-06-17 (main key ID 2512E3C7)

gpg: gpg-agent is not available in this session
Enter passphrase: 
</pre>

I cannot think of anything that would make gpg's password prompting behave differently inside tmux than outside, either.

I think that to debug this, you are going to need to look at what the gpg process is trying to do.
