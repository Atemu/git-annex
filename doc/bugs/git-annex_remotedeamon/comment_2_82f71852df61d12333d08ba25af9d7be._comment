hmmm - I think that it's arguable that if in the repository group drop down I select \"client\" then the remote repo should *not* be bare.

I would predict that this new functionality will supercede the existing use-cases in terms of popularity.  It's very cool that all my machines can be kept in sync with just ssh - a walkthrough showing desktop, laptop, and phone all just syncing (i.e., without the cloud transfer repo and jabber complications) makes a much simpler and compelling advert for this cool code!  But it won't happen unless the GUI supports it...
