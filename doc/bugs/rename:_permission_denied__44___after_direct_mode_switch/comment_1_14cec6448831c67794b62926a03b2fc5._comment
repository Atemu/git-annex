I was able to cause a permission denied on `git annex direct` if I made the file in .git/annex/objects be owned by an different user than me. I do not know how that could happen in normal operation of git-annex.


I have made `git annex direct` catch this exception and continue. So you will get a repository that is switched to direct mode, but with one file that is still a symlink to the content, and if you fix the permissions problem, `git annex fsck` will fix it.

I am curious about any details of how your repository got into the original state..
