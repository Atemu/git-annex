I've implemented the http special remote, that can be combined with other
special remotes to access them using anonymous http.

I think that probably addresses this todo well enough to close it.
(Although I didn't get around to
[[todo/make_http_special_remote_support_exporttree_remotes]] yet, and this
todo mentions supporting exporttree. Should be easy to add later though.)

There are probably some special remotes that are unusual enough that the
http special remote can't support them, which it would make sense to add a
publicurl= config to, like S3 has. (Although I think S3 itself could now be
used with the http special remote so its option is vestigal now.)

I guess that publicurl= config would best be added to the individual
special remote, so it doesn't need any particular support in git-annex to
add it.
