Sorry for the delay (my laptop hard drive died so I was offline for a few days).

Just tested git-annex 5.20140320 on my NAS and it works just fine! The webapp is running, I can connect to it, and there's no more spam in the daemon.log (except for the dbus message every minute, but that's not really a problem).

Thanks a lot Joey!
