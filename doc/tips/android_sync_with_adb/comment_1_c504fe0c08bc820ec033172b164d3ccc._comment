I've tried to use this special remote with my android Pixel 3a phone. It connects via mtp.  
In Debian, this mounts to the /run folder.
Specifically in my case:  /run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=Google_Pixel_3a_94MBY0DHLL/Internal shared storage/DCIM

I've tried as follows but I keep getting below error.


git annex initremote android type=adb androiddirectory=/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp\:host\=Google_Pixel_3a_94MBY0DHLL/Internal\ shared\ storage/DCIM  encryption=none exporttree=yes importtree=yes
initremote android 
git-annex: adb: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: does not exist (No such file or directory)
failed
git-annex: initremote: 1 failed

I've attempted to surround the androiddirectory is both single and double quotes, or substituting it with a symbolic link, but can't get past this.

Thanks
M
