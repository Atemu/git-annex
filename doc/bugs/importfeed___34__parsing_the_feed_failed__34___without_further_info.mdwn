### Please describe the problem.

git-annex fails to parse the "Dlf - Der Tag" RSS feed. It doesn't give me helpful info with debug and verbose flags either. In other RSS reader (tested Akregator), the feed is working.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
cd ~/podcasts # into any annexed dir
git annex importfeed https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/podcast-deutschlandfunk-der-tag.3417.de.podcast.xml
```

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

- git-annex version: 7.20190507-g6eaa0af42f
- Archlinux (Linux 5.1.11-arch1-1-ARCH)

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
