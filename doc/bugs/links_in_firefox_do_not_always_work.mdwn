### Please describe the problem.

I noticed that you (@joey) wrote

> webapp: Odd problem when using Firefox: Some links don't seem to load. Clicking on such a link repeatedly will eventually load the right page. Network console shows web browser is requesting page "/" despite a link to another page being clicked on. Workaround: Use Chrome instead; no such problem there.

in [[todo/windows_support]], and thought I would get around to mentioning that I also see this problem on linux (so it's not windows specific), but I am using firefox.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Click on a link in the webapp; most of the time, even though the link target is correct, the current page is reloaded instead of loading the target.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
5.20131205-gc448602

Ubuntu 13.04, firefox 25.0.1
