I think there are two bugs here. I just reproduced and fixed a bug that would caused `git annex unused` to sometimes not notice certain unused keys when in direct mode. That's why the number you were finding in direct and indirect was different.

That does not explain why `copy --unused` would not operate on unused files when in direct mode. A problem I have not managed to reproduce..

There was a recent change to the format of the .git/annex/unused.log, which temporarily broke reading it (fixed in 5.20140210). This could be some version skew problem, as while the new git-annex version can read the old log format, the old git-annex version will ignore the new log format.
