* Create a git-annex repo where a lot of files live.
* Start an annex add.
* Kill it.
* git-annex uninit

Now, whatever files were annexed (ie: moved to .git/annex/objects/) but not committed are lost as the .git/annex directory was deleted.

I know there are two conflicting issues here:

1. if there is legitimately unused data in .git/annex then that shouldn't be unannexed
2. the above case where some files were annexed but not committed should be unannexed

Maybe uninit could check to see if all symlinks currently in the repo pointing to something under .git/annex/objects are committed. If not, commit them then uninit, or just de-annex them.
