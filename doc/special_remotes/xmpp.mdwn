XMPP (Jabber) is used by the [[assistant]] as a git remote. This is,
technically not a git-annex special remote (large files are not transferred
over XMPP; only git commits are sent).

Typically XMPP will be set up using the web app, but here's how a manual
set up could be accomplished:

1. xmpp login credentials need to be stored in `.git/annex/creds/xmpp`.
   Obviously this file should be mode 600. An example file:

	XMPPCreds {xmppUsername = "joeyhess", xmppPassword = "xxxx", xmppHostname = "xmpp.l.google.com.", xmppPort = 5222, xmppJID = "joeyhess@gmail.com"}

2. A git remote is created using a special url, of the form `xmpp::user@host`
   For the above example, it would be `url = xmpp::joeyhess@gmail.com`

3. The uuid of one of the other clients using XMPP should be configured
   using the `annex.uuid` setting, the same as is set up for other remotes.

With the above configuration, the [[assistant]] will use xmpp remotes much as
any other git remote. Since XMPP requires a client that is continually running
to see incoming pushes, the XMPP remote cannot be used with git at the
command line.

Server support status.

1. Gmail jabber server is working properly. (Google apps users will have to edit `.git/annex/creds/xmpp` manually)

2. [[Prosody|http://prosody.im/]] and [[Metronome|http://www.lightwitch.org/]] daemons are working properly.

3. Ejabberd is [[failing|http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/XMPP_authentication_failure/]]. ([[Authentication bug|https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-1632]]: Fixed in debian unstable with version 2.1.10-5)

4. jabberd14 is [[failing|http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/XMPP_authentication_failure/#comment-4ce5aeabd12ca3016290b3d8255f6ef1]]. (No further information)

5. Openfire/Tigase/iChat Server/jabberd2 are unverified/untested.
