I have the same problem as the initial reporter.

USB drive is FAT32 in direct mode

laptop is ext4 in indirect mode

nas is ext4 in indirect mode

Syncing nas with laptop and vice versa works with no problems.

But as soon as I sync with USB drive it behaves like all commits on laptop and nas that happened since the last sync are reverted.

I can recover the files on laptop and nas by ```git reset --hard origin/master``` and ```git reset --hard origin/synced/master``` on laptop or nas.

However, I cannot reset master and synced/master on the USB drive (error is \"fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree\").

This is the tree as seen from the on laptop after syncing and resetting as described above:

    *   9bdc037 (n900/synced/master, n900/master) merge refs/heads/synced/master                                                 ### <--- THIS IS THE STATE WHEN SYNCING WITH USB DRIVE all added files are deleted
    |\
    | * 1236008 (HEAD -> master, origin/synced/master, origin/master, nas/synced/master, nas/master, synced/master) ADDED FILES  ### <--- THIS IS THE LAST GOOD STATE

n900 is the USB drive
nas and origin are both the same

How can I sync my USB drive without loosing my last commits?
