@anarcat, it seems to me that you need to find a minumal way to reproduce this.

What architecture, what specfic model of CPU? 

Can you reproduce it by running the assistant in a new, empty git annex repository? If not, find the difference between that repository and the repository it happens in. If so, it would probably make sense to build git-annex from source with most features disabled to see if one of them causes it, and if not, try to get it down to a minimal test case suitable to being submitted as a GHC bug.
