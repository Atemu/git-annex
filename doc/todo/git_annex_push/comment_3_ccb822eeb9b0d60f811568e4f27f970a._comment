I tend to be uncomfortable with wrapping many git commands into git-annex
commands with the same name. All the regular git commands can be used
in a git-annex repository, and I don't want to get users thinking they need
to look for git-annex commands instead when the git commands work perfectly
well.

`git annex copy` is fundamentally different than `git push`, so the user
needs to learn about the complication of needing to copy the contents
around separately. Perhaps even copying content to different (special)
remotes than where git pushes to. `git annex sync --content` is there for
users who want to keep two repos in sync and don't want to be concerned with the details.
`git annex push` would seem to be for users who want to know about the details,
but not all of them. Seems like a losing and/or confusing choice.
