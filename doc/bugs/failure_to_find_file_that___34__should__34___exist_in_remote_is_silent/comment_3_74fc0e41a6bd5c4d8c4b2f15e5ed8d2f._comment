The --from is the missing piece to reproduce:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
joey@gnu:~/tmp/old/mydir2>git annex get disk2 --from origin
joey@gnu:~/tmp/old/mydir2>
\"\"\"]]

What's going on here is that `get --from` is essentially an alias to `copy --from`, and that skips copying files that it knows are not present on the remote. Since the remote is a local directory, it's inexpensive for it to check if the file is really there, rather than relying on the location log.

This seems suboptimal, but I'm not sure which part of the behavior it makes sense to change. It seems nice for `copy --from` to silently skip files that the remote does not have, to avoid much unnecessary output when processing a lot of files.Â Maybe `get --from` should behave differently?
