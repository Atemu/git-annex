The test suite's `test_export_import` fails on Windows.
It seems that exporting a tree that contains annexed files
somehow ends up exporting an empty tree.

The test is running in an adjusted unlocked branch. But it exports
the master branch. The master branch indeed contains an empty tree.

The origin repo is also using an adjusted unlocked branch. Some changes
have been committed there, but not synced back to the master branch.

On clone from that, git-annex sets up an adjusted unlocked branch,
and it merges origin's adjusted unlocked branch in. So the annexed files
are present in that branch, but still not in master.

This is not really a windows-specific problem. Only on windows or perhaps
on a crippled FS does the test suite actually test opeation in an unlocked
adjusted branch, because it enters that mode only on demand. Arguably
the test suite should run all the tests separately on an adjusted branch,
but that would add a lot of extra time to the test suite and very few
tests are likely to behave any differently there.

On balance, I think that making the test case run a git-annex sync
before exporting is good enough.
