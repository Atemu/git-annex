### Please describe the problem.

When I import files that include ignored files, it seems to confuse git-annex (see below).

This chunk repeats over and over, it looks like import gets stuck until I delete the ignored files. 

Can't the ignored files just be ignored?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

`git annex import ../some-tree-with-ignored-files`

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

    $ git annex version
