To the extent that this is a bug in git-annex import, it's solved
by using the new feature of importing a tree from a directory special
remote. When used that way, there's no --deduplicate or --clean-duplicates
option that causes this problem. Instead it makes git commits tracking the
content of the remote directory, and as long as you merge that remote into
your master branch, the original filename will be preserved in git.

So once [[todo/remove_legacy_import_directory_interface]] happens, I
guess this could be considered fixed, to the extent it's a bug in git-annex
at all and not with using `git reset --hard` as I showed could lead to the
same thing in vanilla git.
