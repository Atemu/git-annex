It seems you must have tweaked the annex.bloomcapacity and/or annex.bloomaccuracy settings, probably to some quite large values.

For example capacity of 50000000 and accuracy of 10000000000 will fail this way.

This happens when it runs out of Double floating point precision to calculate the requested bloom filter size. I think that a bloom filter can be built that has this capacity/accuracy, it's just that Data.BloomFilter.Easy.safeSuggestSizing falls over trying to find the bloom filter size. Also, such a bloom filter may use rather a lot of memory..
