Sounds like a permissions error. Take a look at the repository in `~/Desktop/annex/` or `~/annex/` , and see if it contains files owned by root, or has bad directory permissions that would prevent your normal user from accessing it. Don't forget to check in its `.git` directory.

I'd recommend not running the git-annex webapp as root. (There may be valid use cases for root to use git-annex in command-line mode.)
