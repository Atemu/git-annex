I installed Haskell via MacPorts and managed to compile git-annex as described via cabal.

On the initial start, git-annex webapp starts just fine and the webapp opens in the browser. When I try to configure a local repository, the webapp crashes.

    1 jsilence@zeo ~ % git-annex webapp
    (Recording state in git...)
    WebApp crashed: watch mode is not available on this system
    
    Launching web browser on file:///var/folders/6b/6bWnFAnbFXSPCLPvCnKNrE+++TI/-Tmp-/webapp1003.html
    jsilence@zeo ~ % 

\"watch mode is not suported\" suggests that lsof is not in the PATH. lsof resides in /usr/sbin and can be found just fine:

    jsilence@zeo ~ % which lsof
    /usr/sbin/lsof

Any help would be appreciated.
