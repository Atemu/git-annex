Thanks for the reproducer.  I tested it out locally, hoping I could
report that the hang was resolved in the 8.20201127 release
(specifically by 8.20201116-47-gd8b7f6721 [*]).  Unfortunately, your
example still hangs for me on master (708181175).  As with the linked
report below, it looks like that hang starts with 7245a9ed5 (Improve
shutdown process for external special remotes and external backends,
2020-11-02).
