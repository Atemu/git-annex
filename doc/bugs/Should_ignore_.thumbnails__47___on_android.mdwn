### Please describe the problem.

When creating a Camera repository on android, the .thumbnails/ directory (containing useless crushed JPGs and even more useless oodles of thumbnail metadata databases) is annexed. This leads to confusion (assistant tries to annex database and thumbnails in modification) and waste (uploading/annexing unusable/unneeded metadata).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Install git-annex on Android and choose the defaults for a camera repository.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20130601, Android 4.2.2


### Please provide any additional information below.
