git-annex 3.20120418 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * bugfix: Adding a dotfile also caused all non-dotfiles to be added.
   * bup: Properly handle key names with spaces or other things that are
     not legal git refs.
   * git-annex (but not git-annex-shell) supports the git help.autocorrect
     configuration setting, doing fuzzy matching using the restricted
     Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance, just as git does. This adds a build
     dependency on the haskell edit-distance library.
   * Renamed diskfree.c to avoid OSX case insensativity bug.
   * cabal now installs git-annex-shell as a symlink to git-annex.
   * cabal file now autodetects whether S3 support is available."""]]
