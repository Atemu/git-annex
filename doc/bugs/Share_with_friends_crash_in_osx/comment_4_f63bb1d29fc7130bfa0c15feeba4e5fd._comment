The problem on 10.9.1 appears to be related to the version of libxml2 thats being used. There is a console message on startup that shows this:
    
    dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/libxml2.2.dylib
      Referenced from: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOs/bundle/git-annex
      Reason: Incompatible library version: git-annex requires version 12.0.0 or later, but libxml2.2.dylib provides version 10.0.0
    
 I have actually been unable to build the newest version of libxml2 which I guess will have a library version 12 on mavericks so far tonight via Brew.  I keep getting errors like:

    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr/include/sys/_types.h:132:9: error: unknown type name '__int32_t'
    typedef __int32_t       __darwin_suseconds_t;   /* [???] microseconds */

So far the interwebs are failing me and I don't have a solution.
