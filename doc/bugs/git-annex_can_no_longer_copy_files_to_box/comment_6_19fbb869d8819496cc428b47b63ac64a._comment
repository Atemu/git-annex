Comparing git annex log and my arch linux install (i.e., pacman) logs, I can see that I was still able to copy files to box after upgrading (on 9/21) to haskell-dav 1.3.1-158 (linked to in your comment) and git-annex 6.20170818-19, both of which were built against aeson 1.2.2.0. So it may be that Dav is not the problem, despite the fact that this is a webdav issue. 

Through examination of the logs, I find that this issue occurred immediately upon upgrading to git-annex 6.20170925-1. I'm not sure how to test this further.

For the record, here are the libraries (immediate dependencies) where standalone and arch git-annex report different versions:

aws (0.14.1 vs. 0.16),
cryptonite (0.20 vs. 0.24),
feed (0.3.11.1 vs. 1.0.0.0),
ghc (8.0.1 vs. 8.2.1),
http-client (0.4.31.1 vs. 0.5.7.0),
persistent-sqlite (2.6 vs. 2.6.2),
uuid (1.3.12 vs. 1.3.13),
yesod (1.4.3 vs. 1.4.5)
