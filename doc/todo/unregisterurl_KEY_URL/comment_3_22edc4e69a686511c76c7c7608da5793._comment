After using setpresentkey git-annex still has the url
registered and a later addurl of a new url would make git-annex also
start trying the old url. Also, if there are several urls, you might only
want to remove one, not remove it from the web special remote entirely
as setpresentkey does.

`rmurl --key` would be fine until a batch version was wanted, and then
something would need to be done about [[todo/git-annex-get_--batch_--key]].
Which would be good to solve generally somehow, but otoh, `git-annex
unregisterurl` neatly avoids that more general problem. Also, it makes
sense that a registerurl user would look for a dual command like
unregisterurl before looking in rmurl for a way to do it.

So I think unregisterurl is the right thing to add.
