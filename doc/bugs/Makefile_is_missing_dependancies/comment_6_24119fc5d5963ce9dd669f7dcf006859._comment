I forgot to mention that the statfs64 stuff in OSX seems to be deprecated, see http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/statfs64.2.html

on a slightly different note, is anonymous pushing to the \"wiki\" over git allowed? I'd prefer to be able to edit stuff inline for updating some of my own comments if I can :P
