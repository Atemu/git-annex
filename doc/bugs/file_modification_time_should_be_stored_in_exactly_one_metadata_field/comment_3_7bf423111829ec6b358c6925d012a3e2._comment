If pure functions were part of the design anyway, why not avoid adding derived fields and introduce functions like `year()` etc instead? The semantics would be obvious (you don't assign to a function call) and existing workflows involving the year field would keep working.

As for editing the timestamp in general, I'll post an answer to <https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/proposal_for_timestamp_semantics/> later that should address this.
