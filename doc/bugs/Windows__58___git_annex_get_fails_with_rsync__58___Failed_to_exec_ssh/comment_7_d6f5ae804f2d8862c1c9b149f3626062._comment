Hi.

I have the situation where my C: is too full, so I'm installing Git 2.5 on E: in E:\Program files\ instead of C:\Program files\

Then while installing git-annex, I'll install it in the same E:\Program files\git\ 

But then, the installer complains that git couldn't be found in c:, and whenever rsyncs are attempted, they fail with :
rsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer

I think there's probably some weirdness about the paths.

I hope this is easy to reproduce and fix.

Thanks in advance.
