I am new to git annex. I like the concept of partial checkout, given that I have multiple storages. 

My repo is small right now, 2000+ files collectively amounting to 24 MB in size. However, as soon as I add and unlock the repo, the size of the Annex folder becomes 50+ MB. Is this normal? I try to sync with google drive and the size goes to 90+ Mb post syncing. 

I feel like I must be doing something wrong. Does the size of gorw upto 4 times the original data. I tried the methods listed in above comments, none worked. Seeing that last comment is 4+ years old, I wanted to know if these methods are still viable?
