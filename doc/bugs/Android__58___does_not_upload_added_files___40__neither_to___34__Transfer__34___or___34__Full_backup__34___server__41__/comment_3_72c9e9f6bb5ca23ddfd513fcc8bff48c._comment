ah -- may be that was debug log, but nothing exciting was happening?  .git/config does have annex.debug true

ok -- went to \"switch repositories\", showed the list of my only repository, clicking on it didn't go anywhere... ok - restarted the beast in the terminal, added a new file to the pics/ directory, again -- registered, added to git, synced, did not 'push' the load, and no informative debug messages:

so again that pid msg but no debug logging seems to be done.  Is there some other way to enable debug logging? ;)
