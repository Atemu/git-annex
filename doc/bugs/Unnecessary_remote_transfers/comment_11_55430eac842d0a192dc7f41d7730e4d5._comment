Yes, either of the assistants will still back up files to it, as long as they have it configured as a git remote. The same way that your transfer repository is (probably) not running the git-annex assistant.

It does sound like using the removable drive UI would have saved you some trouble. I'm not sure why the webapp would not list a llvm device as a removable drive -- from inspecting the code, it seems like it would not be filtered out, as long as /proc/mounts shows the decive as /dev/something (I don't have a llvm device handy to check what it looks like).
