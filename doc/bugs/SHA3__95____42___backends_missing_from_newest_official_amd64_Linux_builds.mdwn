### Please describe the problem.

All the new wonderful SHA3&#95;&#42; backends are gone from the Linux AMD64 build of 5.20150825-g7826f84. They exist in the i386 version (5.20150824-g8529cb2), though. It's probably compiled without Cryptonite support or something.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Everything involving any of the SHA3&#95;&#42; backends result in an "unknown backend SHA3&#95;&#42;" error with the amd64 build (5.20150825-g7826f84). The i386 version (5.20150824-g8529cb2) works.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Newest official builds from downloads.kitenet.net . Debian GNU/Linux all the way.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Oh, yes. It rules. :) One of the most important programs I use because I have all my valuable stuff in it. My files have never been safer.
