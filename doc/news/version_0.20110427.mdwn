git-annex 0.20110427 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Switch back to haskell SHA library, so git-annex remains buildable on
     Debian stable.
   * Added rsync special remotes. This could be used, for example, to
     store annexed content on rsync.net (encrypted naturally). Or anywhere else.
   * Bugfix: Avoid pipeline stall when running git annex drop or fsck on a
     lot of files. Possibly only occured with ghc 7."""]]
