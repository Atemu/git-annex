Reproduced this using a directory special remote.

The first checkpresent is because a file can be present on a remote in
non-chunked form, since a remote can be reconfigured to add chunking.
So it's nothing to worry about.

The lack of encryption of the key when checking to resume is definitely a
bug. A bit of a security bug too.
(I double checked the other operations and they all encrypt keys)
