All in all there are 258465 files on two branches (master (8921) and manyfiles (249544)) and about as many keys. I mostly work on the master branch (The manyfiles branch is more or less an archive), so the two passes are not an problem (yet).

Regarding \"git cat-file --batch-all-objects --unordered\", the blob can be mapped back to the key by the objectname and \"git ls-tree -r git-annex\".

For reference: \"time git cat-file --batch --batch-all-objects --unordered --buffer > /dev/zero\" takes 40 seconds on my repo.
