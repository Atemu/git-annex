 subject="RFC: how would it work for regular git remote + special remote"
 date="2019-11-08T19:19:18Z"
 content="""
Added recently `--sameas` functionality provides support at the \"UUID logistics\" level, and examples in the comments exercise it for two external remotes (rsync + directory) with the same layout of annex objects.
The original use case I am pursuing is for a regular git repository (e.g. non-bare) with \"git repository\" layout of the store (i.e. under `.git/annex/objects/`) use a special remote primarily as a transport mechanism. In our case it will be `globus`.  I really doubt it would work \"out of the box\" since AFAIK any special remote has only two possible ideas about layout of objects: its regular \"special remote layout\" (e.g. a flat list of keys or with some hash directories) or exported (such as a file tree). Only in case of `git` special remote layout would be the same, but otherwise special remote layout would be different, and \"export\" wouldn't really be the one desired (especially for placing files to the remote).
So it seems that the only way to accomplish my mission would be to implement in the `globus` custom special remote the support of additional layout by parametrizing special remote upon initremote with e.g. `layout=local`, which would lookup location for the key in the local repository (under `.git/annex/objects`), and use it as the path for the key on the remote.

Is that a correct idea Joey?  or you see a better way?
