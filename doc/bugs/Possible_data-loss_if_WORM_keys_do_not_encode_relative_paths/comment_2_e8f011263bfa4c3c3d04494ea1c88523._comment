Hm, I don’t quite follow the remark on having everything in a single
directory. Rather than saying that the relative path adds additional
entropy, what I was aiming at is the file-system cannot have two
alternate versions of one file name at the same path with the same
mtime, and that’s why it occurred to me that encoding both path and
mtime within the key doesn’t just increase the odds, but effectively
_guarantees_ that there won’t be any collisions. Does this seem to
hold up, or am I missing something? (Of course one can fudge the
mtimes, but that’s something under the user’s control.)

While a large repo with many files very likely has lots of distinct
files with identical basename, mtime (in s.) and size, all these files
with the same mtime must necessarily be located at different paths.
