Thanks for sharing the answer you found, it helped me out as well.

To add on, modifying a special remote via `git annex enableremote myspecialremote autoenable=true && git annex sync` also propagates the updated configuration to reachable repositories. That said, you have to manually remove and re-enable remote to get the new configuration for each repo.
