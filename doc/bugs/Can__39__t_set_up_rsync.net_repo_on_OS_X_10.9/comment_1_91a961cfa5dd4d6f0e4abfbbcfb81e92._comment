I've just gotten my rsync.net account unwedged, and can confirm that the ssh-askpass hack does work. After what seemed like git-annex successfully uploading an ssh keypair to the rsync.net remote, I removed the ssh-askpass stub script and rolled my rsync.net password. Now, I'm getting these log entries:

```

```

Looks like git-annex asks for the password for some reason? I'm not sure what's going on here, please advise.
