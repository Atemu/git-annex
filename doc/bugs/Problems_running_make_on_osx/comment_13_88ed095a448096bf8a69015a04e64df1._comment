The dtrace puzzlingly does not have the same errors shown above, but a set of mostly new errors. I don't know what to make of that.

> git-annex: git-annex/.t/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit: fileAccess: permission denied (Operation not permitted)

This seems to be caused by it setting the execute bit on the file. I don't know why that would fail; it's just written the file and renamed it into place so clearly should be able to write to it.

> was able to modify annexed file's sha1foo content

This also suggests something breaking with permissions.
