Just passing along from https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/77#issuecomment-134688459

joey:  I do think there could be a use case for configuring a special remote with autoenable=true and have git-annex init try to enable all such remotes.

> [[done]], I made both `git init` and `git annex reinit` auto-enable
> such special remotes. For now, the assistant does not (could change).
> 
> There was also the question of what to do when git-annex auto-inits
> in a clone of a repository. It wouldn't do for a command like
> `git annex find`'s output to include any messages that might be shown while
> auto-enabling special remotes as a result of an auto-init.
> Since I can't guarantee enabling special remotes will be quiet, I've not
> tried to auto-enable special remotes in this case. 
> 
> I think I'd have to
> exec a git-annex init process with stdout sent to stderr to implement
> this in a safe way, and due to calls to ensureInitialized in Remote.Git,
> which can auto-init a local remote, that gets particularly tricky. Best, I
> feel, to wait and see if anyone needs that.
