FYI, comment #10's solution doesn't work. Apparently, git-annex also ignores any `.*` directory or file (can't find documentation on this?).

Unfortunately, this a dealbreaker for me. I wanted to use git-annex in my office to sync my work folder (which includes a several git repos) across three computers.
