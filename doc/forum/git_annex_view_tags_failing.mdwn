I'm on a windows 10 machine and not using wls.  I'm sorting through some photos and tagging them with people, but when I attempt to view my tags I can't.  Below is the command and output. I tried searching around a bit, but I'm not entirely sure where to start.  On my last commit I didn't open an editor, I used the -m flag, and I've checked Task Manager and except for the Git-Bash terminal, I don't see any git processes running.  I'm not familiar enough with the internals of git or git annex to understand where it could be going wrong and would really appreciate some help.  Thanks. 

    $ git annex view tags=*
    view (searching...) fatal: Unable to create 'D:\projects\2020-philippines\.git\annex\viewindex.lock': File exists.

    Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
    an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
    are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
    may have crashed in this repository earlier:
    remove the file manually to continue.
