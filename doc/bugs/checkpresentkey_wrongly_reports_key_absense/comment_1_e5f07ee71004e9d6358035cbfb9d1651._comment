I see a transcript of .. something .. with no explanation of what's going
on. Everything in the transcript looks more or less reasonable?

I could spend an hour or ten trying to guess at what bug is, but it seems more
efficient for you to explain what you expected it do and why you think 
the actual behavior is wrong?
