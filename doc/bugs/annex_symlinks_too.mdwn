Hi,

Because git annex doesn't annex symlinks, it is not possible to copy files from the a repository with a simple cp/rsync dereferencing each files. If we do this as of today, we would lose the original symlink information.
Would it be possible to change this behavior in the future, at least with an option?

Thanks
