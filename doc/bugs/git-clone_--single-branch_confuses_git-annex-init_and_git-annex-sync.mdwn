If a repo is cloned using `git clone --single-branch --depth 1`, `git-annex-init` and `git-annex-sync` do not seem to correctly fetch the `git-annex` and `synced/git-annex` branches.  `git-annex-info` does not list remotes that were known at the cloned repo.

> This is not a bug. You have cloned a repository without cloning the
> git-annex branch, so as far as git-annex can *possibly* know, this is a
> git repository in which git-annex has never been used before.
> 
> As soon as you fetch the git-annex branch from origin, git-annex will
