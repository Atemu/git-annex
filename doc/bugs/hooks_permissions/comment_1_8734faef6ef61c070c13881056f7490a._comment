Thanks for the fix! I've manually updated the permissions of the hooks to 755 but unfortunately they are still not executed in a repo mounted via sshfs. There seems to be a kind of protection feature (which I can understand, as we're not sure of what's inside a remote executable). 


    $ ls -l .git/hooks/post-checkout
    .rwxr-xr-x 76 gueux 27 Feb 20:33 .git/hooks/post-checkout
    $ .git/hooks/post-checkout
    bash: .git/hooks/post-checkout: Permission denied
