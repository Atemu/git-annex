[[!toggleable text="""
   * Fix `git annex add ../foo` (when ran in a subdir of the repo).
   * Add configure step to build process.
   * Only use cp -a if it is supported, falling back to cp -p or plain cp
     as needed for portability.
   * cp --reflink=auto is used if supported, and will make git annex unlock
     much faster on filesystems like btrfs that support copy on write."""]]
