Aha, in other words, some kind of PEBCAC put in a polite way. :) I thought this should be correct, as the man page says

> For example, --pathdepth=1 will use \"dir/subdir/bigfile\", while --pathdepth=3 will use \"bigfile\".

This is how I thought it worked:

* 0 = hostname, path, filename
* 1 = path, filename
* 2 = filename

After reading your answer I first thought it was a typo in the documentation, but of course the number specify the level of subdirectories to use in the file name. D'oh!

Thanks for the fix and information.
