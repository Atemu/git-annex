git-annex outsources all cryptography (aside from hashes) to gnupg; it is
not cargo-culting to include cryptographic key generation in that set.

If gnupg changes to use getrandom by default then git-annex will follow suite.

(Also, use of "cargo-culting" "straw man" etc tends to not lead to good
quality discussions. EOT for me.)
