Another approach would be to generate a SHA256 key, make the annex link,
and then use `git-annex migrate --backend=SHA256E` to convert the annex link.

And hmm, that does point toward a way to use the existing backend API
cleanly. Why bother with writing out the symlinks only to have migrate
convert them? The fastMigrate API has well-defined inputs, so we can just
expose it.

Eg:

	git-annex examinekey SHA256--xxx --format="${key} ${objectpath}" \
		--migrate-to-backend=SHA256E --filename=foo.tar.gz

--batch would need to input the filename as well as the key when
used with --migrate-to-backend.
