OK. Glad to hear. I'll move this bug to done.

There are some notes on how to run git commands on a direct mode repo here: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/direct_mode/#index8h2>. I would do this on a copy of your repo though.

Also Joey did mention (5 years ago) that you can [switch to indirect mode to run git commands](http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Retrieve_previous_version_in_direct_mode/#comment-2d28e7d2f8442e2d815e7dff485a6b77). I am not sure if you would be able to switch back to direct mode with the latest git-annex thoughâ€¦ I would do this on a copy of your repo if need be.
