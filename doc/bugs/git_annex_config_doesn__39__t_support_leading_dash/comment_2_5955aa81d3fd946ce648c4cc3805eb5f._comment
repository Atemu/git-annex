I had been putting the `--` between `--set` and the value rather than between the value and the option. As I understand it, the traditional meaning of `--` is \"all arguments after this point are positional\", which would mean it should work anywhere as long as it's after the last option argument. So I guess the title of this bug should be \"-- only works just in front of the value\"?
