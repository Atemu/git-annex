Hi Joey,

Would it be safe to init that repo with those `tunables` such as ` -c annex.tune.objecthash1=true -c annex.tune.branchhash1=true` to save some inodes etc?   Any other tunable which might be of benefit (I still hope that I will see the time whenever the \"KEY/\" directory would be gone ;-))?
I've tried with those two above (although annex.tune.branchhash1=true is probably irrelevant here) and it seems to do the right thing (at least for the objecthash1), but I just wanted to make sure I am not shooting myself into the foot.
