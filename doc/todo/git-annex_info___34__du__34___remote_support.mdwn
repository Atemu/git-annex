so i know about the various discussions around a `du` that follows git-annex symlinks (e.g. [[forum/__34__du__34___equivalent_on_an_annex__63__/]] or [[forum/gadu_-_git-annex_disk_usage/]]. this is not about that, or at least not directly. :)

i believe there's a distinct use-case for a simpler `du` subcommand that will calculate the disk space used locally (in case of the default `--in here`) but could also use the tracking log to determine the space usage in *other* locations. this would be especially useful on remotes that we don't have shell access to, s3 comes to mind. i thought that `git annex info` could output that, but it seems it doesn't:

<pre>
$ git annex info . --in s3 --exclude='video/original/*'
directory: .
local annex keys: 0
local annex size: 0 bytes
annexed files in working tree: 0

just to be clear here, the problem isn't as much providing `du-like output`, which `git annex info $path` does pretty well. the problem is that it doesn't work on remote servers, at least that is what i observed above.

i still think it would be nice to have a `du` command, just because it's a command "WTF" situation users seem to get stuck into.. but this issue is only about having this work on remote repositories. thanks! -- [[anarcat]]
