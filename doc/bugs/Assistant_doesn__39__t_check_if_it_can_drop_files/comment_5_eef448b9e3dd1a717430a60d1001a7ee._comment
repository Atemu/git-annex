The assistant defaults to assuming all files are wanted if there's no preferred content settings, while command-line dropping stuff defaults to assuming no files are wanted (or more accurately, that you'll drop anything you don't want and get anything you do) when there's no preferred content settings. So the default differs, but this only matters when not setting preferred contents.

I agree that the vicfg could be misread, so have changed it.
