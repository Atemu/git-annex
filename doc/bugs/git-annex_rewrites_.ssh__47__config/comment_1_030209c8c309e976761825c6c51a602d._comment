The assistant does not normally do this when you merely start it up. It does it
when you configure a ssh remote, when it needs to modify that file.
It might also modify the file on startup if it detects a configuration that
an old version of the assistant put in that needs to be fixed up.

Is the trailing whitespace you speak of just a newline added after the
existing host block, or something else? Your "..." is not very clear.

Fixed symlink issue in git.
