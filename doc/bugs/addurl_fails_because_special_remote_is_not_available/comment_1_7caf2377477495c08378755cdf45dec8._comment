Post the trace (with `git annex --debug --verbose`) and your config files (`git config --list`)?  (Redact any sensitive info).  Maybe, `annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses` excludes the IP address of the URL, so the built-in web remote never gets a chance to claim the URL?  I recall running into something like you describe, and the issue was with some config setting I had.
