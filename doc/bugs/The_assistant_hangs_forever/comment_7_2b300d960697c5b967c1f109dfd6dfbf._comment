@joey just to make the connection clear, both @saironiq and I use the same git-annex package (bin package) from Arch linux AUR (@saironiq is the maintainer of the package)

I suspect all 64bits binary packages on Arch linux to exhibit problems. 

The package is fetching the bin archive from your repo: so I actually dare to suspect that all recent 64bits versions have similar problems.

I have describe one problem but they are many, so it does not take long to realize that the apps is not working properly.

I guess it is a packaging problem (something is missing in <http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz>), not an application bug ?
