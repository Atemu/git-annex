git-annex 5.20140116 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Added tahoe special remote.
   * external special remote protocol: Added GETGITDIR, and GETAVAILABILITY.
   * Refuse to build with git older than 1.7.1.1, which is needed for
     git checkout -B
   * map: Fix display of v5 direct mode repos.
   * repair: Support old git versions from before git fsck --no-dangling was
     implemented.
   * Fix a long-standing bug that could cause the wrong index file to be used
     when committing to the git-annex branch, if GIT\_INDEX\_FILE is set in the
     environment. This typically resulted in git-annex branch log files being
     committed to the master branch and later showing up in the work tree.
     (These log files can be safely removed.)
   * assistant: Detect if .git/annex/index is corrupt at startup, and
     recover.
   * repair: Fix bug in packed refs file exploding code that caused a .gitrefs
     directory to be created instead of .git/refs
   * Fix FTBFS on mipsel and sparc due to test suite not being available
     on those architectures.
   * Android: Avoid passing --clobber to busybox wget."""]]
