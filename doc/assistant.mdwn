The git-annex assistant creates a folder on each of your computers,
Android devices, removable drives, and cloud services, which
it keeps synchronised, so its contents are the same everywhere.
It's very easy to use, and has all the power of git and git-annex.

## installation

The git-annex assistant comes as part of git-annex, starting with version
3.20120924. See [[install]] to get it installed.

Note that the git-annex assistant is still beta quality code. See
the [[release_notes]] for known infelicities and upgrade instructions.
