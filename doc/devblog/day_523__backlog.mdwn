So I've been catching up on backlog for a couple of days. Including reading
all the old todos, and closing a bunch of them that turned out to have been
implemented already.

Today I added an annex.jobs setting, fixed annex.web-options
which was broken in the semi-recent security update,
and fixed a very tricky bug in rmurl.

(What happened to the <http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/to_and_from_multiple_remotes/>
I was working on earlier this week? When I looked at the details, it was
much more complicated than I had thought. Back burnered.)
