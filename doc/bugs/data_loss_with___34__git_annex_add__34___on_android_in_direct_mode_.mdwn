**What steps will reproduce the problem?**

> git annex add .

**What is the expected output? What do you see instead?**

This was with direct mode turned on.  Distinct files should remain distinct.  Instead, many of the original files were overwritten and became copies of one of the other files.

**What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?**

Running rooted android on a Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  Working in a system directory which is not "crippled".
The git-annex package was dated 2013-03-23 and downloaded from

**Please provide any additional information below.**

I wish I could provide files that became duplicates, but I didn't make copies before adding them...  Did this twice, first adding JPG and MP4 files, then adding WAVs.  After that, I saw that of 100 JPGs and 8 MP4s, about half the JPGs and all of the MP4s had become copies of a single JPG.  Of 11 WAV files, two had been replaced with copies of one of the others.
