It's not even necessary to delete the symlink, you can just
rename the new version of the file over it.

Unlocking the file is only necessary if you want to edit it in place.

Unlocking a file does add a little bit of overhead. Mostly making
a copy of it that is not needed when you're just going to overwrite it.
Also the annex pointer gets added as a git object (which will get garbage
collected eventually) and some minor things get stored to git-annex's
internal database to keep track of it.
