### Please describe the problem.
Files transferred from one repository to a standard remote by the assistant do not retain the original mtime

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Create manually two repositories, in my case on two external drives directly connected to my box, with normal remotes pointing to each other.
Activate git annex assistant and synchronize some files from one to the other.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Git annex version 5.20140610-g5ec8bcf on Ubuntu Linux 12.04

### Please provide any additional information below.
I've noticed how files synchronized from one repository to another do not retain the original mtime information.
Perhaps it's intended, but in my view retaining the time of modification of the object is essential.
