Actually you can create a service from any program or batch file using srvany.exe from the windows resource kit: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/137890. An alternative would be the Non-Sucking Service Manager http://nssm.cc/ 
Also nsis has some plugins for creating services, but i havent tried any of them: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/How_do_I_start/stop/create/remove/check_a_service

Upsides:
1) You don't have to touch your code or change anything in the compilation just to create the service
2) git-annex will still work fine from the console
Downside: You'd have to include an extra binary or plugin in your installer for creating the service

But I'm pretty sure that none of the commandline calls would pop up in a new window that way, but if you need the verbose mode, you could still start the webapp from console instead as service and everything will show as expected
