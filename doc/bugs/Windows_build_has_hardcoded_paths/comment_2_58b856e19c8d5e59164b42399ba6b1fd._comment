Incorrect assumption from my part.
I reinstalled git into the expected path (C:\program files\Git)
and the problem is still there.

Running git-annex from command-line works.
(I tried running git-annex test. It had 23 failed tests,
most of them because of inability to access the remote: origin.
But it ran just fine.)
Running the web-app gives the error listed above.
