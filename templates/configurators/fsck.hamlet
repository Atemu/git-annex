    Consistency checks
  <p>
    Checking the contents of a repository periodically will ensure that #
    your data is in good shape. Any problems that are detected will #
    be automatically fixed.
  <p>
    Running the consistency check involves reading all the files in the #
    repository, which can take a long time if it's large. Running just a #
    little at a time will eventually check the whole repository.
  $if (not (null checks))
    <p>
      Currently scheduled checks:
      $forall check <- checks
        ^{fsckForm False check}
  <p>
    Add a check:
    ^{fsckForm True defaultFsck}
