Oh yeah!  That makes sense now.  It's not exactly that it's failing, it's just that the command \"git annex get --from=bar foo\" means \"get any copies of foo which might exist in the bar remote.\"  Not \"get the copy of foo which I happen to know exists in the bar remote.\"

I'm not sure either exactly what \"better\" behavior would be.
