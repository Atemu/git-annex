# NAME

git-annex-shell - Restricted login shell for git-annex only SSH access

# SYNOPSIS

git-annex-shell [-c] command [params ...]

# DESCRIPTION

git-annex-shell is a restricted shell, similar to git-shell, which
can be used as a login shell for SSH accounts.

Since its syntax is identical to git-shell's, it can be used as a drop-in
replacement anywhere git-shell is used. For example it can be used as a 
user's restricted login shell.

# COMMANDS

Any command not listed below is passed through to git-shell.

Note that the directory parameter should be an absolute path, otherwise
it is assumed to be relative to the user's home directory. Also the
first "/~/" or "/~user/" is expanded to the specified home directory.

* configlist directory

  This outputs a subset of the git configuration, in the same form as
  `git config --list`

* inannex directory [key ...]

  This checks if all specified keys are present in the annex, 
  and exits zero if so.

* dropkey directory [key ...]

  This drops the annexed data for the specified keys.

* recvkey directory key

  This runs rsync in server mode to receive the content of a key,
  and stores the content in the annex.

* sendkey directory key

  This runs rsync in server mode to transfer out the content of a key.

* commit

  This commits any staged changes to the git-annex branch.
  It also runs the annex-content hook.

# OPTIONS

Most options are the same as in git-annex. The ones specific
to git-annex-shell are:

* --uuid=UUID

  git-annex uses this to specify the UUID of the repository it was expecting
  git-annex-shell to access, as a sanity check.

# HOOK

After content is received or dropped from the repository by git-annex-shell,
it runs a hook, `.git/hooks/annex-content` (or `hooks/annex-content` on a bare
repository). The hook is not currently passed any information about what
changed.

# ENVIRONMENT

* GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_READONLY

  If set, disallows any command that could modify the repository.

* GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_LIMITED

  If set, disallows running git-shell to handle unknown commands.
