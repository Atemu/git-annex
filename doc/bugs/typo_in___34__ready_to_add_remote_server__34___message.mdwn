What steps will reproduce the problem?
Add a ssh remote to an existing git annex repository. The word "sensitive" is misspelled.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
I expect to see:
"The contents of your files will be stored, fully encrypted, on the server. The server will not store other information about your git repository. This is the best choice if you don't run the server yourself, or have sensitive data."

But instead I see:
"The contents of your files will be stored, fully encrypted, on the server. The server will not store other information about your git repository. This is the best choice if you don't run the server yourself, or have sensative data."

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
3.20130102, Fedora 17 x86_64
