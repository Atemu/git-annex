Nice to see there's finally an up-to-date version of git for windows.

However, it's not too surprising, since this is an entirely different build
from the msysgit that git-annex has been made to work with, that it doesn't
quite work with git-annex. This stuff is *extremely* fiddly on windows.

Seems that the new git for windows ships ssh in Program Files/git/usr/bin.
Since that's not in PATH, rsync can't find it. I tried a few things, but
can't find a way yet that makes rsync find it.
