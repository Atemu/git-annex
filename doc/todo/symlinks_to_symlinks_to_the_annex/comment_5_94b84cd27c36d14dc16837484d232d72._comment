I often work with scenarios where I want to `git annex get` files where I'm not actually in a git annex repository but in a symlink farm that fans out (often via directory-level indirections) into git annices (is there a canonical plural?). There, what I use is a short script that `readlink`s the to-be-fetched files until it contains a `.git/annex/objects` part and then fetches that in its original annex. If there were a way to do that with a standard `git annex get`, possibly (if after some deliberation there remain security concerns) behind a --follow-symlinks switch, I'd appreciate that.
