S3 lets you [redirect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/how-to-page-redirect.html) requests for an object to another object, or to a URL.  This could be used to export a git branch, in the manner of [[`git-annex-export`|git-annex-export]], but with annexed objects redirecting to a key-value S3 remote in the same bucket.
