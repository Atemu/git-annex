By the time this stall happens, the test suite has gotten past the failing
`export_import` test. It would be good to know if that test now succeeds.

Did you wait on the stall long enough for annex.pidlocktimeout to expire?
(Default 300 seconds.)

I tried this to reproduce it, which did not here. Would be interesting to
know if it does on the filesystem in question.

	git init a
	cd a
	git annex init
	git config annex.pidlock true
	date > foo
	git annex add
	cp -a foo bar
	git add bar
	git commit -m add
	cd ..
	git clone a b
	cd b
	git annex init
	git config annex.pidlock true
	git annex get -J1 foo bar
	git annex drop -J1
	cp -a foo baz
	git add baz
	git annex get -J2 foo bar baz
	git annex drop -J2

That should be identical to what the test case does.
