That means I update the metadata periodically by a script such as

    for k in `find . -name \"*.CR2\"`; do
        if [ -e `dirname $k`/`basename $k .CR2`.JPG ]; then
            <set metadata>
        fi
    done

and add a corresponding preferred content setting? I'll try that. Btw, is there a possibility to use the xmp files of my raw converter (darktable) as source for metadata? I want to do the same with images that have a low star rating (<1 star should not be synchronized to the notebook computer and dropped from there as soon as they are on the external disk), and I hope there is a possibility to not double this metadata but directly use the xmp output. The xmp files are checked into the git regularly (without git annex).
