Hmm, that's a surprising error message to see in this situation.

It sort of looks like git-annex has been unable to lock the local copy of
the content to indicate that it's in the process of dropping it. I can
reproduce the error message if I purposefully make it not provide a content
removal lock. But, I cannot find a code path where a content removal lock
is not actually provided when dropping from the local repo. 
(`Command.Drop.performLocal` always passes  `Just contentlock` to `doDrop`.)

Can you paste a full transcript of this happening so I can be sure I
understand what you're doing and seeing?
