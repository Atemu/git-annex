git-annex 7.20200219 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Added sync --only-annex, which syncs the git-annex branch and annexed
     content but leaves managing the other git branches up to you.
   * Added annex.synconlyannex git config setting, which can also be set with
     git-annex config to configure sync in all clones of the repo.
   * fsck --from remote: Fix a concurrency bug that could make it incorrectly
     detect that content in the remote is corrupt, and remove it, resulting in
     data loss.
   * When git-annex is built with a ssh that does not support ssh connection
     caching, default annex.sshcaching to false, but let the user override it.
   * Improve warning messages further when ssh connection caching cannot
     be used, to clearly state why.
   * Avoid throwing fatal errors when asked to write to a readonly
     git remote on http.
   * Fix support for repositories tuned with annex.tune.branchhash1=true,
     including --all not working and git-annex log not displaying anything
     for annexed files."""]]
