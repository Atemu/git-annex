I implemented `git annex adjust --hide-missing`.
It can be run after any change to content availability to update
the adjusted branch, hiding or unhiding files.

My implementation is not as fast as it could be; each update
is a linear scan of the whole original branch and rebuild of the adjusted
branch. But it all works so we'll defer speeding this up to later bug
reports about it being too slow. ;)
