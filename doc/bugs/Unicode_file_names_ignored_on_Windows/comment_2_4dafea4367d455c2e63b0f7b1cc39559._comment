One approach might be to not use the GHC FileSystemEncoding on Windows, and assume that Windows filenames are always in a unicode encoding. After all, the FileSystemEncoding is only used by git-annex on Unix because Unix has no canonical encoding that will work for all filenames.

Hmm, nope, I tried this and it just causes an \"invalid byte sequence\" crash when reading from git-ls-files.
