Euh. I actually feel stupid enough with this but ...

I have try first with your link and it gives me:

```
./runshell: line 75: /home/vagrant/programs/git-annex.linux/bin/sh: No such file or directory
```

As I told you I then try the AUR package : https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex-standalone/

And it does give me the same error on line 69.

It is the same line (3 lines before the end):

```
exec \"$cmd\" \"$@\"
```

I really don't get it because the file is there ... and the first sanity checks of the script have pass.
