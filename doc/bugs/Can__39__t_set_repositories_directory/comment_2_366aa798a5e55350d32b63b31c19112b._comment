Ran into this same problem just now. I can't start as I cant make a repository.

Error:

Internal Server Error
user error (git [\"--git-dir=/Users/Nathan/annex/.git\",\"--work-tree=/Users/Nathan/annex\",\"commit-tree\",\"4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904\"] exited 128)

git-annex version: 

4.20130626-g2dd6f84

Could this have something to do with me first frigging around trying to get git-annex installed via homebrew? Maybe I broke something first?
