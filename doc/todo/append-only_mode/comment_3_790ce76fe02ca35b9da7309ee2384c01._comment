I think it would go better in a tips page than on the man page.
Especially since no complete solution is available and it's well beyond the
scope of a manpage for git-annex-shell to document such a solution.

It seems to me that allowing untrusted people to push to the git-annex
branch is asking for various mischeif. One that comes to mind is they can
add a repository, configure it to be trusted, and make git-annex think
it has a copy of all content. Combined with preferred content settings this
could make git-annex drop the only actual copy of content.
