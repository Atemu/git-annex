You can use --force to disable the ignores check.

It might be a good idea to have an explict option to do it, since --force
might also have other effects.

With -J, git-annex will run more check-ignore processes, and so won't
bottleneck on one, but IDK how much if any that actually speeds it up.
Since batch async is implemented already, you can try and find out now!
