Using symmetric keys is significantly cheaper, computation-wise.

The scheme of encrypting symmetric keys with asymmetric ones is ancient, well-proven, and generally accepted as a good approach.

Using per-key files makes access control more fine-grained and is only a real performance issue once while creating the private key and a little bit every time more than one file needs to be decrypted as more than one symmetric key needs to be taken care of.
