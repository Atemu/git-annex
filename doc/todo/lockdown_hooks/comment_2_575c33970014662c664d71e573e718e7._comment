Seems likely that there are a couple of different ways to use
ACLs to remove write access. In the simple case, any existing ACL can be
overwritten. In other cases, some other existing ACLs will need to be
preserved and only a single part changed. In some cases, the ACL for a user
should be changed, in others the ACL for a group.

And there are several different varieties of ACLs (POSIX, NFS, Windows). 
And there's the immutable bit, which might be wanted in some specific
circumstances but certianly not by most people.

So it makes sense to me to not embed specific knowledge of this into git-annex.

This feels to me like something that the system administrator is going to
want to set up. It would mostly be limited to repositories inside a given
mount point that needs the unusual lockdown method due to using NFS or
whatever. The global gitconfig can be set up to switch on the config only
for those repositories, and the system administrator can set up hooks
for the particular use case.

I don't see why something like datalad would need to worry about this
detail, any more than they worry about the PATH to system programs or other
such things that the administrator sets up.
