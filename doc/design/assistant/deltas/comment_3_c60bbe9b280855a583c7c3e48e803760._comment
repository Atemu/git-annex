are there plans to have chunks stored in the regular backend storage?

i'm curious because one my use cases is archiving websites, where we end up with lots of WARC files. those files are basically a bunch of files from the website gzipp'd together in a stream, which means that multiple crawls of the same website (or actually, different website) have *lots* of redundant data (e.g. jQuery.js). storing those files in git-annex is not very efficient, because that data is duplicated all over the place.

if the storage backend was chunked, there could be massive deduplication across those files... this is why i looked at the [[todo/borg_special_remote]]: I figured that i could at least deduplicate on the remote side, but it would still be nice to have this built-in! -- [[anarcat]]
