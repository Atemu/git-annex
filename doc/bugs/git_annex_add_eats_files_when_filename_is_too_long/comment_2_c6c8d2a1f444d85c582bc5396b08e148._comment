For example if the file is owned by root, I guess git-annex fails when it tries to remove write permissions (I retested with the last version of today (whose \"version\" subcommand still outputs 3.20110702)).By the way, it would be nice to have a log file created containing the list of all failures, to avoid having to scan manually all the output of a long git-annex operation.
