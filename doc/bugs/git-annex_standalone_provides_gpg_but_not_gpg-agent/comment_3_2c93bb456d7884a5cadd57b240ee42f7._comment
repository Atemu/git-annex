If I move gpg-agent out of path and presumably reproduce the problem,
I get this output from the test suite:

	    crypto:                                               gpg: failed to start agent '/usr/bin/gpg-agent': No such file or directory
	gpg: can't connect to the agent: No such file or directory
	gpg: error getting the KEK: No agent running
	FAIL
	      Exception: user error (gpg ["--batch","--no-tty","--use-agent","--quiet","--trust-model","always","--import","-q"] exited 2)

Which is the kind of information I was asking for.

[[!commit aee9adbadc2f17c5b5394fc2fde6c57c26917024]] has some relevant info.
I tried making git-annex not pass --use-agent, but it still tries
to use the agent:

	    crypto:                                               gpg: failed to start agent '/usr/bin/gpg-agent': No such file or directory
	gpg: can't connect to the agent: No such file or directory
	gpg: error getting the KEK: No agent running
	FAIL
	      Exception: user error (gpg ["--quiet","--trust-model","always","--import","-q"] exited 2)
	    preferred content:                                    wanted . ok

I guess the easist thing would be to drop gpg fraom the standalone bundle.
Including gpg-agent in there seems like a bad idea; it's a daemon that
other gpg versions than the bundled one might try to talk to.
