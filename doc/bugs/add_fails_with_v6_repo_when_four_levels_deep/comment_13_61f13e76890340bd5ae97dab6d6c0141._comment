Wow, I'm really appreciate the in-depth analysis. Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with the inner workings of git/git-annex to dig that deep, so I'm happy you were able to (intermittently) reproduce it. In particular, it seems you've done some great work with the smudge filters, but that's all way above my head still.

That's good to know that it was actually a bug in git itself. Thanks for submitting the bug report; hopefully that takes care of the problem.

Using `GIT_PREFIX` is a clever work-around. I appreciate all your help with this!
