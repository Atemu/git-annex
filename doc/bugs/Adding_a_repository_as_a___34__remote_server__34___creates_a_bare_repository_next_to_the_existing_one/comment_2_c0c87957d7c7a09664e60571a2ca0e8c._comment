I found a different workaround. I added the remote repo via the \"remote server\" option. After that I shut down the local assistant and deleted all the new bare repository stuff on the remote machine. After restarting the local assistant syncing worked as expected and no new bare repository was initialized.

On an other machine I was able to transform the bare repository into a non-bare one and check out the files. After that syncing also still worked.

The remote git-annex-shell is working well. I already described this in an other bug report, where I always ended up in it while trying to log into the machine manually.
