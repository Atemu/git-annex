`git annex move` does not honor numcopies. It is the only
git-annex command to not honor numcopies by default.

This can be surprising, and it complicates git-annex's story about
attempting to preserve numcopies since there's this exception on the side.

Also, `git annex move --to untrusted-repo` drops the local copy even if the
untrusted copy is the only remaining copy, which is another unique thing
about move.

Should `git annex move --safe` become the default, and `git annex move
--unsafe` be needed to get the current behavior? 

(Note that the `-u` short option makes that easy enough to type for those
of us who have workflows using the current behavior.)

Such a change would break workflows, and potentially quite a lot of
examples in the documentation might need to be updated. Although with the
default numcopies=1, the move behavior would not change (except when moving
onto an untrusted repository, ), which will limit the imact some.

There could be a transition period where move warns when run w/o
--safe/--unsafe.
