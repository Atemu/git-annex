So [[bugs/git-annex_auto_upgrade_is_redundant]] strikes again. I have fixed up the versions to avoid this upgrade loop again. I would rather discuss any problems with where the automatic upgrade code puts git-annex in a separate bug report than this one.. (If you're running git-annex as a user that is not allowed to write to the directory where you installed it in the first place then yes, it cannot write there and will instead unpack itself into the home directory.)

There are many strange things in the log, but this is probably the strangest:

> fatal: Could not switch to '/home/jwiklund/Documents/.git/annex/merge/': No such file or directory

This is the gitAnnexMergeDir used for direct mode merges. Since git-annex always creates that directory before starting a merge, I don't know how it could fail to exist.

Other strange things:

* The assistant fixes stale index.lock files on startup. But the log shows the assistant starting up and shortly thereafter there's a stale index.lock file. All I can think is that perhaps two git processes are trying to commit at the same time.

* \"fatal: pathspec 'music.txt' did not match any files\", apparently output by git-add.

* \"error: duplicate parent 294b61a3dce1e87a62e4d675deac2a9130b819e6 ignored\", which would happen if git-commit-tree were passed duplicate parent refs. AFAICS, the only place in git-annex that might do that is when it commits the git-annex branch. (While this says it's an error, it really is ignored, and git-commit-tree continues and makes a valid commit.)
