### Please describe the problem.

My windows install (2013-09-09) fails "quick checks" when running "git annex test".  See below the errors from two seperate runs of the test in two fresh empty directories:

*** Failed! Exception: 'recoverEncode: invalid argument (invalid character)' (after 13 tests): 
Key {keyName = "\140\DEL\159/\RS'", keyBackendName = "WQACSWJDVY", keySize = Just 6, keyMtime = Just 3}
prop_idempotent_configEscape

*** Failed! Exception: 'recoverEncode: invalid argument (invalid character)' (after 4 tests): 
Key {keyName = "\130", keyBackendName = "Y", keySize = Nothing, keyMtime = Nothing}
prop_idempotent_configEscape

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

cd to it in cmd or Git Bash
