Thanks for the fix. The new tarball does not show the issue anymore.

Regarding \"due to the way it is run\":

* I use Konsole as my terminal under xfce, inside of that is bash
* I made sure that I removed old stuff beforehand \"rm -rf .config/git-annex/ Desktop/annex/ .ssh/git-annex-*\"
* I went to the directory in the tarball \"git-annex.linux\" and called \"./git-annex webapp\"
* Browser used is firefox

I guess I should setup the PATH properly. This was just meant as a test for the tarball given that there is no up to date package for ubuntu available anymore.

Not sure if there is other information that would help you determine if I run this in a special way.
