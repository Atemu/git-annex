There is not much git-annex involved here; git receive-pack is being run in the
usual way by a git push, and git-annex-shell only forks off a git-shell to
handle it in the usual way.

If you change the ssh command to git-shell then git-annex would be out of
the picture, and so you could then tell if git-annex is somehow involved in
the problem at all on the server.

But I think that upgrading the client is the first step, or checking to
see if it has corresponding git processes that are keeping those git
receive-pack's going.

It could be that the client is losing connection with the server in a way
that doesn't cause the TCP connection to be closed on the server, and so it
waits around for whatever TCP timeout might eventually close it.
