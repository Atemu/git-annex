Thank you very much for your work! It's so very exciting...

The web app says \"Wrong Password\" for my gmail/home-google-apps/work-google-apps addresses, but they are correct.

If you like, I can send you debug output, just kindly point to where to get it. This is just attempted testing help and not a tech support request, so please respond whenever, or not.

I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 running http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/3.20121112/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz
