This behavior makes more sense to me. I like keeping my text files in git and binaries in git-annex, and treating them separately is no great mental burden.

Thanks for your great work. Git-annex has become one of the best parts of my computing experience. It is a great relief knowing that my files are in a robust distributed and redundant collection that is easy to maintain.
