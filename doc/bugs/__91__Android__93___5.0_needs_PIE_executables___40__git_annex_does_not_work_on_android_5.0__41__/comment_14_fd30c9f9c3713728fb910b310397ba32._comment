Hi Joey, everybody,

I was successful in syncing a repository (twice, and including contents) using version 5.20150107-g0e8cf92.
The environment is: Nexus 7 (2013), Android 5.0.1, not rooted.

Note, however, that this version spews a lot of bionic warnings (I'm using
git-annex from the terminal):

Probably hamless, but I thought I'd mention them.
