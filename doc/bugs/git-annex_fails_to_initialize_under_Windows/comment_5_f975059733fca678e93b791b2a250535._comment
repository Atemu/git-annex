You might want to try upgrading to msysgit 1.9.0, which is the one I am using for windows development.

So, your screenshot shows that git checkout -B annex/direct/master worked ok when you ran it, but then when git-annex init failed, it was running
the same command, only with a -q also. The -q is only quiet mode, shouldn't matter.

(The .t folder is created when running git-annex test, so not relevant.)
