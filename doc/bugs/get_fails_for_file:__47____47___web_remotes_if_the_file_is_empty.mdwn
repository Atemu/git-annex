###What steps will reproduce the problem?
    $ touch /home/arand/empty
    $ git annex addurl 'file:///home/arand/empty'                                                                             
    addurl _home_arand_empty (downloading file:///home/arand/empty ...) 
    
    git-annex: /home/arand/tmp/c/.git/annex/tmp/URL--file&c%%%home%arand%empty: getFileStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)
    failed
    git-annex: addurl: 1 failed

###What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
If it is possible to distinguish between empty files and files that just fail to open, it would be nice if Annex were able to handle it, or at least give a more obvious error message.
