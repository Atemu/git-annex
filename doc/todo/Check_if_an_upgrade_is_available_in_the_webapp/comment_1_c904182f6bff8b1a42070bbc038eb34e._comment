I have thought about doing this, especially if there is ever a security hole in git-annex.

All it needs is a file containing the version number to be written along-side the git-annex build, and git-annex knowing if it was built as a standalone build, and should check that.

As for actually performing the upgrade:

* Easy on Linux
* Not sure on OSX.. Is it possible to use hdiutil attach to replace a dmg while a program contained in it is currently running?
* Probably impossible on Android, at least not without using double the space. Probably better to get git-annex into an app store.
* Doable on Windows, but would need git-annex to be distributed in a form that was not a installer.exe.
