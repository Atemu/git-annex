I think I didn't fully consider the `addurl --file` behavior when adding this
feature.

It seems to make sense for CLAIMURL to be used, since a special remote may
claim the url. It seems to make sense for CHECKURL to then be called (if
not --relaxed) to check that the url's content is present before adding it.

If CHECKURL-CONTENTS returns a file, it makes sense to check the file
size, but not use the suggested filename.

If CHECKURL-MULTI returns multiple files, I think it makes sense to give up
with an error.
