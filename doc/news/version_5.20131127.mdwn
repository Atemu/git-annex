git-annex 5.20131127 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * webapp: Detect when upgrades are available, and upgrade if the user
     desires.
     (Only when git-annex is installed using the prebuilt binaries
     from git-annex upstream, not from eg Debian.)
   * assistant: Detect when the git-annex binary is modified or replaced,
     and either prompt the user to restart the program, or automatically
     restart it.
   * annex.autoupgrade configures both the above upgrade behaviors.
   * Added support for quvi 0.9. Slightly suboptimal due to limitations in its
     interface compared with the old version.
   * Bug fix: annex.version did not get set on automatic upgrade to v5 direct
     mode repo, so the upgrade was performed repeatedly, slowing commands down.
   * webapp: Fix bug that broke switching between local repositories
     that use the new guarded direct mode.
   * Android: Fix stripping of the git-annex binary.
   * Android: Make terminal app show git-annex version number.
   * Android: Re-enable XMPP support.
   * reinject: Allow to be used in direct mode.
   * Futher improvements to git repo repair. Has now been tested in tens
     of thousands of intentionally damaged repos, and successfully
     repaired them all.
   * Allow use of --unused in bare repository."""]]
