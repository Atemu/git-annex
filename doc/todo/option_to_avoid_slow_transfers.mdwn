I'd like an option that makes transfers (get,copy,etc) of files fail if the
transfer speed falls below a given rate. 

My use case is that I'm pulling files off a hard drive and read
errors/retries (by the kernel) are slowing it down to a crawl for some
files. I'd like to make a first pass getting all the files it can transfer
at the usual speed and skipping the ones that are coming too slow. Then
I can see what files it failed on and either resume those or see if I have
a copy of them somewhere else.

I imagine there could be other use cases...
