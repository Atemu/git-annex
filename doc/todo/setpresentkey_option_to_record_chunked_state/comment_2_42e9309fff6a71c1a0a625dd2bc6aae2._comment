\"What is the use case?\" -- to register with git-annex the presence of a file in a remote, that is already split into chunks, without downloading the file.
\"I would rather not complicate setpresentkey with things not related to presence information\" -- makes sense.
\"you may as well just write data to the branch yourself\" -- yes; just wasn't sure if that might break some invariant, e.g. between the branch and the SQL databases derived from it.

Don't worry about this todo, I'll figure it out.
