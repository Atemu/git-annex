### Please describe the problem.

On windows, fails getting files with the following error : "rsync: Failed to exec ssh: No such file or directory". The server runs gitolite. I've tested from a Linux client, and it works.

    $ git annex get big\ file
    get big file (from origin...) rsync: Failed to exec ssh: No such file or directory (2)
    rsync error: error in IPC code (code 14) at /home/lapo/package/rsync-3.0.9-1/src/rsync-3.0.9/pipe.c(84) [Receiver=3.0.9]

    git-annex: get: 1 failed


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

'git clone' from a repo containing a big file, then git annex init locally, then git get for the file contained in the repo

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Git for windows, from http://git-scm.com/downloads (referenced from https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Windows/), i.e. Git 2.5.0

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes :-) Only on linux so far and trying on windows now :-/
