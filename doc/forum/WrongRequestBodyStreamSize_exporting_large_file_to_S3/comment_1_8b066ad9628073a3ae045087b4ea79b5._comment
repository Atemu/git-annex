How large, in bytes, is the file you were trying to upload there,
and what was the partsize?

WrongRequestBodyStreamSize is an exception from the http-client
library. It throws this when writing a request to the http server
and the stream of data included in the request somehow does not have the
length it expected.

It expected 31419314 bytes and got only 29814466, and this appears
to have been the last part of the file.

Looking at the http-client code, it seems almost certainly due to a
RequestBodyStream declaring an incorrect length of the stream. And,
git-annex does use RequestBodyStream in particular in S3 multipart uploads.
So it seems most likely a git-annex bug.
