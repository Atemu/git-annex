Yesterday I implemented the command-line interface for
`git annex import branch --from remote` and today I got a prototype of it
it working with the directory special remote. Still a whole lot to do
before this feature is ready for release, but it's good to have the command
line interface working to play with it. The workflow feels pretty good:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/t> echo hello > ../dir/new_file
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/t> git annex import master --from dir
	import dir ok
	update refs/remotes/dir/master ok
	(recording state in git...)
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/t> git merge dir/master
	Updating d3277e2..410aa8e
	Fast-forward
	 new_file | 1 +
	 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
	 create mode 120000 new_file
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/t> cat new_file
	hello

My laptop's keyboard is dying; the S and X keys often don't register. Is 
making programming feel very clumsy, and there are far too many S's in
the code I've been working on. ;-)
