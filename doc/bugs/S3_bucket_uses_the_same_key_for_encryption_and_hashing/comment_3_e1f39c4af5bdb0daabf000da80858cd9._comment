Yes, encrypting the symmetric key with users' regular gpg keys is the plan.

I don't think that encryption of content in a git annex remote makes much sense; the filenames obviously cannot be encrypted there. It's more likely that the same encryption would get used for a bup remote, or with the [[special_remotes/directory]] remote I threw in today.
