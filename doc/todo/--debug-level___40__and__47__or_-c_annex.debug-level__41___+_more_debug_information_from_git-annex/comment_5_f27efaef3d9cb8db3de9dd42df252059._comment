Re comment #3, it occurs to me that currently anything that accesses
AnnexState does an MVar access, which will have around the same overhead as
a call to debugM. But much more frequently used.

So, anything in AnnexState that is frequently used and is immutable
and could be split out to Reader will avoid that MVar access and be a
free performance win. Good reason to split AnnexState, whether or not
it's used to speed debugging.
