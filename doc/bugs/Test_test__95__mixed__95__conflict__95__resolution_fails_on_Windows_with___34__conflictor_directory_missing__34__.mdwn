git-annex: Not fully uninitialized
Some annexed data is still left in C:\Users\Tobias\testdir\t2\.t\tmprepo37\.git\annex\objects\
This may include deleted files, or old versions of modified files.

If you don't care about preserving the data, just delete the
directory.

Or, you can move it to another location, in case it turns out
something in there is important.

Or, you can run `git annex unused` followed by `git annex dropunused`
to remove data that is not used by any tag or branch, which might
take care of all the data.

Then run `git annex uninit` again to finish.
