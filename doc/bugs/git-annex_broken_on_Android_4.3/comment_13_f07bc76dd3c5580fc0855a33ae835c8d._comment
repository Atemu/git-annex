I have Samsung Epic 4G (epic_mtd) that I'm no longer using and would be quite happy to send you---it's older, and slow, but it is at least currently supported by CyanogenMod, so it should be possible to install 10.2 milestone builds on it and at least do basic testing.

Hell, if it would really facilitate Android support, I'd happily pick up something like a B&N Nook HD+ and send it to you---that should be similarly amenable to CM installs and testing.

Though I will also understand if you don't necessarily want to have a bunch of superfluous hardware laying around.
