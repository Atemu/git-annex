See my explanation above. By manually starting the webapp inside your ~/annex repository you forced it to view that repository.

It's not unusual for the webapp to display it syncing some files that have been synced before. This repository may not be up-to-date on which files have been sent where, and it will quickly notice the file has already been transferred and skip doing anything for that file.
