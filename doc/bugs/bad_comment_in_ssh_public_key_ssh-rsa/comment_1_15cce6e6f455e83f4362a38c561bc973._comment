Trying to pair Ubuntu 13.04 (git-annex 3.20121112ubuntu4) with OS X 10.7.5 (not sure where to see version info, but it was marked 2013-07-23 on the download page).

If the pairing is initiated on OS X and the Ubuntu machine tries to connect, the Ubuntu browser shows:
Internal Server Error

Where user@host.fqdn is the user and DNS locally-resolvable host name of the Mac. However, this isn't a key I recognize. Is it generating a new one on the fly? There already are key pairs set up between the machines in my ~/.ssh directory; not sure if relevant.
