This is either a bug in <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aws> or
Digital Ocean's implementation of the S3 protocol. I don't know which,
but I do know it has to be fixed in one of those two place, and not
in git-annex.

The fact that the aws library can't even parse an error message out of
their response kind of says something.

But the real problem seems to
While they claim to support V2 signatures,
my guess is there's a problem with their support for V2, since they're
mostly dealing with V4. The aws library's support for V4 is experimental
and [apparently buggy](https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/262), but
as git-annex uses it, it will only use V2.
