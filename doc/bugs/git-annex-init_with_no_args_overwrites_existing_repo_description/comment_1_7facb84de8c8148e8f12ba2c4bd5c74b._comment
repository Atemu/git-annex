Yikes, I was surprised to see this behavior. fixed for `init`.

For `describe`, I see that when it's run with no parameter for the
description, it sets the description to "". I suppose that's what you
meant.

I suppose something could conceivably depend on the current `git annex
describe remote` behavior, but I checked and it's nowhere documented that
describe with no description is allowed -- even the --help doesn't say that
luckily. So I have also disallowed that.
