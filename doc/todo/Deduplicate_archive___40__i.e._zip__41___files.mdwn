I've just come across this issue and I'm not sure if git-annex is the right place to put it, but in case it is easy enough to do.. may as well ask!

In this scenario, an online service (Bandcamp), automatically creates the archive file when downloading an album each and every time you download it. This results in identical files inside a zip, but different hashes due to the slightly different timestamps on the archive itself.

Would it be possible for git-annex to be able to detect this scenario (in a manner similar to zipcmp) and redirect an add/import to the already existing copy?

I've found this due to trying to decommission an old annex by `git annex import --clean-duplicates ~/annex_old/.git/annex/objects` and finding these files being left.
