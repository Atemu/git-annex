# NAME

git-annex requirednumcopies - configure required number of copies

# SYNOPSIS

git annex requirednumcopies `N`

# DESCRIPTION

Tells git-annex how many copies it is required to preserve of files, over all
repositories. The default is 1.

Run without a number to get the current value.

This configuration is stored in the git-annex branch, so it will be seen
by all clones of the repository. It can be overridden on a per-file basis
by the annex.requirednumcopies setting in .gitattributes files, or can be
overridden temporarily with the --requirednumcopies option.

When git-annex is asked to drop a file, it makes sure that
that the required number of copies will still exist in other
repositories, by locking the content in them, preventing it from
being dropped.

This supplements the [[git-annex-numcopies]](1) setting. git-annex
checks that numcopies is met before dropping. But in situations
involving trusted repositories or special remotes that
cannot lock content in place, the numcopies setting may be violated
when the same file is being dropped at the same time from multiple
repositories. In these unusual situations, git-annex ensures that
the requirednumcopies setting is not violated.
