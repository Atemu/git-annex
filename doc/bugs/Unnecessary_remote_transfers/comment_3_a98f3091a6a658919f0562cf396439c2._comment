Also, I just realized that it's uploading two large files to my remote transfer repo, even though I already have both files in my local paired repo on both systems; i.e. there's no need to send it to the transfer repo at all.  And it was yesterday when the two files were transferred.  So I have no idea why today it thinks it needs to upload them to the transfer repo.  :/
