First off, awesome that git annex auto-fixes itself after I make hard drive space and merge.

The problem was that I didn't realize that my .gitattributes that were supposed to set numcopies to 1 didn't work. (Because I didn't realize that they don't apply recursively.) I fixed my .gitattributes, and then was able to drop those files.

And you are right that the text \"No other repository is known to contain the file\" threw me off. Perhaps when numcopies > 1 you could change that message to \"Not enough other repositories are known to contain the file\".

Thank you.
