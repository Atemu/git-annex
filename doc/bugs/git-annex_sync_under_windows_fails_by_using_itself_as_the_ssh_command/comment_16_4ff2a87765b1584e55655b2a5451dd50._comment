Installed build 4839 and everything seems to work. One quick question though, doing sync on an origin and clone repos, shouldn't it make the git annex list look the same on both? I'm getting on the remote
<pre>
me@mint64vm ~/ga $ git annex list
here
|web
||
X_ me
X_ me_local
X_ me_origin
</pre>
And on the clone (after some copying, moving, dropping and sync)
<pre>
C:\Users\me\q\ga>git annex list
here
|origin
||web
|||bittorrent
||||
_X__ me
_X__ me_local
_X__ me_origin
</pre>
And, of course, thanks for the fix.
