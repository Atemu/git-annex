Unfortunately my attempt at this earlier failed
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/add_ancient_armel_build/>

And of course ancient systems are not getting any better over time, so the
only thing that would succeed is to move the goalposts up some, eg from
armel to armhf (arm 7). But that would almost certianly need a newer kernel
than 2.6.32 to support it.
