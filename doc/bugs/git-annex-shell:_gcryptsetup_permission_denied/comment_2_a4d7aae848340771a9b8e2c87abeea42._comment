The git-annex version on the remote server is the same as the one on the client, the latest one available from the ppa (4.20131024). When I run git-annex-shell on both computers, I obtain:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
git-annex-shell: bad parameters

Usage: git-annex-shell [-c] command [parameters ...] [option ...]

Plumbing commands:

commit       DIRECTORY          commits any staged changes to the git-annex branch
configlist   DIRECTORY          outputs relevant git configuration
dropkey      DIRECTORY KEY ...  drops annexed content for specified keys
gcryptsetup  DIRECTORY VALUE    sets up gcrypt repository
inannex      DIRECTORY KEY ...  checks if keys are present in the annex
recvkey      DIRECTORY KEY      runs rsync in server mode to receive content
sendkey      DIRECTORY KEY      runs rsync in server mode to send content
transferinfo DIRECTORY KEY      updates sender on number of bytes of content received
\"\"\"]]

Both sides seem to understand the gcryptsetup action. Actually, the message gcryptsetup permission denied comes from git-annex-shell, as far as I understand (and from the haskell source linked in the report).
