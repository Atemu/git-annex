screen scrape below, I have no idea why it thinks that text file is locked, so weird.


# git status
HEAD detached at 8.20200309
nothing to commit, working tree clean



# make install PREFIX=/usr/local
if [ \"cabal\" = ./Setup ]; then ghc --make Setup; fi
if [ \"cabal\" != stack ]; then \
	cabal configure  --ghc-options=\"\"; \
else \
	cabal setup ; \
fi
Warning: The configure command is a part of the legacy v1 style of cabal
usage.

Please switch to using either the new project style and the new-configure
command or the legacy v1-configure alias as new-style projects will become the
default in the next version of cabal-install. Please file a bug if you cannot
replicate a working v1- use case with the new-style commands.
