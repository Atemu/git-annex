I also would rather see this as a hook than built into git-annex. It's
something that git-annex's metadata can be leveraged for, perhaps,
but different use cases call for different amounts of data.

I suppose the thing to provide a hook into is whenever git-annex adds an
object content to .git/annex/objects. That will allow the hook
to store the current xattrs after `git annex add`, and to restore them
after eg `git annex get`.

But, suppose you run: `git annex add file; git annex move file --to remote`
Then the remote won't have the updated git-annex branch yet when it stores the
object content, and so the hook run on it won't be able to do anything.

When new git-annex branch version adds/changes xattr values,
the local repository would need to be updated to reflect them.
So, there would also need to be a hook that's run when git-annex
metadata has changed.

See also: [[lockdown_hooks]] which have different use cases, but seem to
call for the same kind of hooks.
