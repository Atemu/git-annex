used when an annexed object in a v7 repository is unlocked.

If you run `git annex lock` on it, it will be turned backed into a symlink to
the .git/annex/objects file.

Normally unlocked files have that pointer replaced with the file content when 
it's available, and only when the file content is not available would you see
that pointer. I guess you've done something to get your repository into this
state where the content is present but the unlocked file is not populated with 
it. It's likely that running `git annex fsck` on the file would fix that problem.
