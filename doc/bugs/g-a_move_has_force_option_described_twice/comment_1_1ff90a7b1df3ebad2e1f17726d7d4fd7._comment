Worse, it's forcing two unrelated behaviors and the user may only
want one of them.

The numcopies check override --force was only recently
added.

The location tracking ignore --force is older, but is unlike
other uses of --force in git-annex. It's so off the radar that it was an
undocumented option from 2013 until I noticed the documentation was missing
in 2017! Also, it's not clear if/when anyone would use that. Seems like
running `git annex sync` first would be more efficient and have the same
result.

So, I'm inclined to keep the numcopies check --force, which matches other
uses of --force in git-annex (eg drop --force), and remove the other
--force behavior, or make it be a differently named option. --slow
would be a good name, by contrast with move --fast.
