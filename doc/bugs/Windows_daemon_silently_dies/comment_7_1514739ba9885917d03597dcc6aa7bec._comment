Well, it seems not to be the RemoteControl thread after all. I made that thread start the remotedaemon and then not read from it at all, and the crash still happens. Also, the remotedaemon itself seems to run forever ok.

(This is sort of a relief, because it should not be possible for a crash of a named thread like RemoteControl to take down the whole assistant!)

The hGetLine must be being called by some other library function.

Hmm... Could it perhaps be waitForTermination? On windows that ends up calling getLine in a loop. A 600 second loop!

Update: Seems so. With a 60 second loop, it crashes after 60 seconds. With the 2 newlines happening just before.

Also, it makes sense now why this is a new crash. Before the assistant ran with stdio connected to the terminal, but recently on windows it got hooked up to the debug log, and stdin is closed now.

I still don't understand where the 2 newlines come from (possibly output by something while git-annex is crashing?).. But have confirmed I've fixed the problem now.
