git-annex requires version 2.4.0.1 or later of the 'network' library. Unfortunately,
the current version of the Haskell Platform mandates version 2.3.1.0 of that library.
This means that git-annex cannot be compiled on the Haskell Platform 2012.4.0.0 (which
is going to remain the HP version of choice until May next year or so).

Do you think it's possible to support *both* versions of the network library, maybe?
That would increase the portability of git-annex quite a bit.

Thank you for your consideration.
