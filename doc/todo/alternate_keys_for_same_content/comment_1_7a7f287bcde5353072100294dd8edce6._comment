This would mean that, every time something about a key is looked up in the
git-annex branch, it would also need to look at the metadata to see if this
`alt_keys` field is set.

So it doubles the time of every single query of the git-annex branch.

I don't think that's a good idea, querying the git-annex branch is already
often a bottleneck to commands.
