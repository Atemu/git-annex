Hello everyone,
Creating a new repository through the web-app fails on Android 4.4.3, git annex version 5.20140612-g1bebb0d.

Steps to reproduce the problem:

1. Install git annex for android 4.4.3

2. Launch git annex.

3. The terminal opens up reporting some (non-fatal?) errors. (I notice that I can't do anything in the terminal, is it supposed to reply to git annex commands? typing in "git annex version" does nothing).

4. The web-app is launched.

5. Click on make repository.

6. Error message.

I've made a few screenshots to illustrate:

This is the webapp error when creating a new repo:

[second](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1qM91oKErVDX3R3cFhyb2VjcHc/edit?usp=sharing)

Being on android I can't find any ".git/annex/daemon.log to" to report. I tried to look in the repo folder but there was no .git in it (maybe hidden?)
