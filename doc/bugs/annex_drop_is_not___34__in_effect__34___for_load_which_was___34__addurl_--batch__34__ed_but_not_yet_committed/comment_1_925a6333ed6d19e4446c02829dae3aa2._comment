git-annex commands only operate on files that are checked into the git
repsitory, which is why drop skips this file that has not been staged yet.
I do not think it makes sense to change that.

git-annex addurl batches changes to the index, which can speed up its
performance significantly when adding a lot of files. So until it's done
you can't operate on the files it adds. That speedup is really the only
reason to use addurl --batch, so it doesn't make sense to change it to not
have that optiomisation, otherwise you could just use it in non-batch mode
and drop after it's done.

So, if you want to drop files as soon as addurl adds them, you need to
either not batch addurl, or you need to drop not by the name of the file
that has not need checked into git yet, but by the key.

So, I think it would make sense for you to use dropkey in this case.
`git annex addurl --json --batch` already includes the key,
so you can just pass that along to `git annex dropkey --batch`

(Do note though that dropkey doesn't verify that other copies exist..)
