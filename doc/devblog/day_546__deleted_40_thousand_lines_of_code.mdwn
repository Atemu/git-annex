Pulled the trigger on the old Android builds, and made a 
[massive commit](http://source.git-annex.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commitdiff;h=38d691a10febf9590dd3639defa0e4f38ec3648c)
removing all the cruft that had built up to enable them. Running in Termux
is just better. It's important to note this does not mean I've given up on
more native git-annex Android stuff, indeed there are promising
developments in ghc Android support that I'm keeping an eye on.

I'll kind of miss the EvilSplicer, that was 750 lines of crazy code to be
proud of. But really, it's going to be great to not have hanging over me
the prospect that any change could break the Android build and end up
needing tons of work to resolve.
