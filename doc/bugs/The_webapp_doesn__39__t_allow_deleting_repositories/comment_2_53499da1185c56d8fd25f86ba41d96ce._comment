I created a new local repository to play with the new Direct Mode features.  I ended up deleting it (deleting the directory), but when I launched the assistant, I was still given the option of \"switching repository\" to the now-deleted one.  It threw the error Internal Server Error (user error (git [\"config\",\"--null\",\"--list\"] exited 126)).
