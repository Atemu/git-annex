git-annex 3.20121016 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * vicfg: New file format, avoids ambiguity with repos that have the same
     description, or no description.
   * Bug fix: A recent change caused git-annex-shell to crash.
   * Better preferred content expression for transfer repos.
   * webapp: Repository edit form can now edit the name of a repository.
   * webapp: Make bare repositories on removable drives, as there is nothing
     to ensure non-bare repos get updated when syncing.
   * webapp: Better behavior when pausing syncing to a remote when a transfer
     scan is running and queueing new transfers for that remote.
   * The standalone binaries are now built to not use ssh connection caching,
     in order to work with old versions of ssh.
   * A relative core.worktree is relative to the gitdir. Now that this is
     handled correctly, git-annex can be used in git submodules.
   * Temporarily disable use of dbus, as the haskell dbus library blows up
     when losing connection, which will need to be fixed upstream."""]]
