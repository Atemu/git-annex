If git-annex knows it isn't going to do what I've instructed (move the file), I think it should just fail the command immediately, rather than copying but not dropping.

You could make *--safe* fallback to copy (for those that want that behaviour) and *--unsafe* has the risky behaviour, but *move* should either do just that, move the file, or do nothing.
