Well it took the whole day to finish the release. Including fixing a
deadlock when the new v6 code runs with an older git, and some build
errors. Ant there's still an intermittent test suite failure involving v6 on
one autobuilder, which will need to be dealt with later.

This is a big release, lots of bug fixes, lots of v6 improvements, and
significant S3 improvements.
