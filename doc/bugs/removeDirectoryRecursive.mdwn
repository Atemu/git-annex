### Please describe the problem.
Can't remove repositories

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
In repo view, click Actions and select Delete. Then enter "Yes, please do as I say!" in text field and click Delete this repo. Error! Internal Server Error: git [Param "config",Param "annex.autocommit",Param "false"] failed

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
6.20160114-g6be9ee0 

Mac OS X

### Please provide any additional information below.

I can't enable logging. When I do, I receive a similar error message

"git [Param "config",Param "annex.diskreserve",Param "1 megabyte"] failed"

I just downloaded and installed Git Annex. This problem was there from day 1.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
