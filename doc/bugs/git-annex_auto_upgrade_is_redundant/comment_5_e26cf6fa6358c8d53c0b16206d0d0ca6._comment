Hi,

Yes there is a git-annex.app.5.20140421 directory in $HOME.  And it looks as though I'm running git-annex.app.5.20140420 - even though I manually tried to upgrade by downloading

https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.9_Mavericks/git-annex.dmg

Running `$HOME/git-annex.app.5.20140421/.../git-annex` gives me `5.20140420-ga25b8bb`.  So the downloaded version even though labeled 5.20140421 contains 5.20140420.
