I tried the following experiment:

1. Manually ran `ssh-add .ssh/key.git-annex-kitenet.net-joey`
2. `ssh -vvv kitenet.net` did run git-annex-shell

Guys, please paste the output of `ssh-add -l`

Also, if you run `ssh-add -D`, the problem should go away, and the server should not run git-annex-shell. If that's the case, we've confirmed this is somehow a ssh agent problem. However, I still don't know what could be scanning `~/.ssh` for random keys and loading them into the agent.
