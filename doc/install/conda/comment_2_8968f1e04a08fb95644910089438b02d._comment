\"this sounds like what @Ilya_Shlyakhter said earlier\" because I maintain the conda package :)  I need to figure out why the `nodep*` version gets chosen even though the `alldep*` version has a higher build number -- will ask conda people and get back.  If you prefer not to be haunted just install with `git-annex=*=alldep*` to force the standard version.
