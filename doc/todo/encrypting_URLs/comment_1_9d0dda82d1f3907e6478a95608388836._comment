Is this about SETURLPRESENT in an external special remote, or is addurl
also supposed to enctypt an url? And how would addurl know if the user
wants to encrypt it, and using what gpg keys?

If your git-annex repo contains information about files you want to remain
private, why not just keep that repo private?
