git-annex does not run ssh-askpass. But your ssh program may try to do so, if git-annex is started without a controlling terminal. So a workaround is to start git-annex from a terminal window and then password prompts will happen there.

[[design/assistant/sshpassword]] is on the roadmap to fix this so git-annex overrides ssh's password prompting, which seems to be broken on a number of systems.

I don't know why it would continue prompting for a ssh password if git-annex successfully set up a ssh keypair for rsync.net. My guess is that it failed to do so.
