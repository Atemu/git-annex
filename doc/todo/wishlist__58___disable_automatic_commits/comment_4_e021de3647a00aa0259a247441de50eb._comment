In a semi-mythical future where I find the time to learn Haskell, in principle would you consider accepting a patch implementing my above suggestion of a new `annex.autocommit` gitattribute which offers finer control of autocommit than the current binary toggle?  It would be very useful to me, and maybe I'm not the only one.
