git-annex can transfer data to or from any of a repository's git remotes.
Depending on where the remote is, the data transfer is done using rsync
(over ssh, with automatic resume), or plain cp (with copy-on-write
optimisations on supported filesystems). Some [[special_remotes]]
are also supported that are not traditional git remotes.

It's equally easy to transfer a single file to or from a repository,
or to launch a retrievel of a massive pile of files from whatever
repositories they are scattered amoung.

git-annex automatically uses whatever remotes are currently accessible,
preferring ones that are less expensive to talk to.
