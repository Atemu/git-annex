Exporting to a directory on an USB drive (ext4) fails for exactly one file. All other files exported fine.

I already renamed the file (it contained an umlaut and a space), I checked permissions, I ran fsck over the file in the annex.

The metered write goes up to 100% then it stalls for one or two seconds and afterwards git-annex just says "Failed".

My issue is that git-annex in general is hard to debug. I ran the command with --verbose and --debug but this also did not provide any clue.

I believe good error handling and logging is a non-trivial problem in Haskell?
