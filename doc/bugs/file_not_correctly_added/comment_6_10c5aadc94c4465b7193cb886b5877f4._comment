Ok, I have a way to reprouduce this. Let's assume that your
original "myLargeFile.CR2" was from some other git-annex repo.
And it was unlocked in that repo. And you dropped it from that repo.
And then maybe you moved it around or copied it, or whatever and forgot that
this happened, leading you to the "cp ../myLargeFile.CR2 ." in your
original steps to reproduce the problem.

Then the content of that file would be something like this:

   echo '/annex/objects/SHA256E-s3--98ea6e4f216f2fb4b69fff9b3a44842c38686ca685f3f55dc48c5d3fb1107be4.CR2' > myLargeFile.CR2

And what happens if I add that?

   # git annex add myLargeFile.CR2
   add myLargeFile.CR2 ok
   # git annex fsck
   fsck myLargeFile.CR2 
      ** No known copies exist of myLargeFile.CR2
   failed

This happens because I added a git-annex link to the repo so now it contains
this link to an object that never got added. Same would happen if I used
git add, or if I did an ln -s to make a .git/annex/objects symlink and added
that. I don't think it's a bug really.

Is this what you did? If not, further responses below, but I'll bet we
can stop here.

----

Configuration can be included in the repo (by git-annex config), but you would
have to be cloning from another repo that had those config settings, not
creating a new repo as you seem to show in your original test case.

Are you sure you didn't miss some place where a git
config could be set? (Eg, /etc/gitconfig)
Running `git config --list | grep annex` would display any git config you
might have missed.

Do whereis/fsck show that immediately after you run "git-annex add",
without and other commands in between?

There's a good chance that a full transcript of it happening would have
some other clue. Like if it enters an adjusted unlocked branch for some
reason.
