I recommend you to first init each repo on each drive separately and add it's files with `git annex add .; git annex sync`, then add each other as a remote and run `git annex sync`, which will merge the file-trees together. <br>
I guess you don't want each drive to contain the content of each file, so you should add all drives to a group and set a [[preferred-content|git-annex-preferred-content]] expression such as  `git annex groupwanted drives \"(not copies=drives:1) or present\"` and then set that on all drives by running `git annex group here drives; git annex wanted here groupwanted` on all drives. This way, `git annex sync --content` won't copy the content of each file to each drive. <br>
You might also want to run `git annex config --set annex.dotfiles true` before adding any files or else dotfiles will be added to git directly. <br>
