### Please describe the problem.

Modifying an annexed file with unlock then commit leaves the link with permissions 777 and git status reports a typechange, which makes checkout impossible. Resolves by running git unlock on the file.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

echo foo > test.txt
git annex add test.txt
git commit -a -m "first"
git annex unlock test.txt
echo foobar > test.txt
git commit -a -m "second"

git status (notice typechange message)

git unlock test.txt (corrects and retains both versions)
