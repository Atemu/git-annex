### Please describe the problem.
When adding a folder with some 80.000 files, the sidebar with "Added x files" gets updated in batches. After some time, it shows (also see attached screenshot):

> Added 6496 files 5781 files 8633 files 7363 files 6159 files

This is a bit ugly. There could a newline after "files".

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Add a folder with many files and subfolders in it.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
4.20130627 

> I have improved the display, now it will just show a single ongoing count,
> and the most recent 10 or so files added. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
