@Mowgl, I see from the errors that whatever version of git-annex you're
trying to build is at least somewhat out of date, since Utility.SRV was
removed last month. The Utility.Mounts problem has also been fixed in newer
versions.

hostAddressToTuple has been provided by all versions of the network package
that git-annex.cabal allows it to build with, so you must have forced it to
build with an older, unsupported version.

Anyway, there is nothing that prevents using git-annex 6.20170818 from
working with any newer version of git-annex, unless you are using a
couple of features added in newer versions.
