What steps will reproduce the problem?

From the webapp, go to Configuration > Manage repositories > Remote server. Enter a hostname that only has an IPv6 hostname (e.g. ipv6.google.com). Click Check this server.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expect the application to attempt to check the server via SSH. Instead, it results in error "cannot resolve host name".

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 3.20120924 on Debian testing (amd64).
