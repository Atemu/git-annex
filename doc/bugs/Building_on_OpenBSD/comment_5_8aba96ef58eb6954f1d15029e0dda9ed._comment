Ok, I missed that uuid needs network-info. Actually, git-annex does not use that part of uuid (it does not put IP info in its uuids). There is a past version of uuid that did not depend on network-info. Perhaps you should first install it: `cabal install uuid-1.2.14`

As far as it not finding or liking the sha* commands, it may be that it is not able to parse the OpenBSD output, or doesn't see the output it expects when testing them. These commands are only used as a minor optimisation, if not available it will fall back to using a haskell implementation which is a few percent slower (or faster) than the linux coreutils version of sha*. I don't know how the speeds compare on OpenBSD, but it's probably not worth worrying about.
