### Please describe the problem.

Git annex sometimes back-propagates the changes from a copy of the repo where files are missing to the one where I just added them and (I hope only seemingly!!!) very quietly deletes my files.
I don't care about solving whatever bug this is or isn't, this question is about getting my data back.
I can use `git log` to see the commits but I can't reset to or checkout any one of them.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

[repo0] git annex add XYZ
[repo0] git annex sync
[repo1] git annex sync
[repo0] git annex sync
[repo0] git reset --hard f67fae3166de7eca5ed8421ea4546aa32b84a964
fatal: this operation must be run in a work tree

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
6.20170818


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes, I did, it works great whenever I barely use, as soon as more data comes in it messes up and data goes missing.
