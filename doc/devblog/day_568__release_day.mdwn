After a long struggle with the test suite, the new
git-annex release is finally out today.

A few last-minute changes in the release include removing
box.com from the webapp since their webdav gateway is EOL at the end of the
month, supporting armv71 in the android installation script, allowing
installation with 64 bit git on windows, and shortening the estimated time
to completion display.
