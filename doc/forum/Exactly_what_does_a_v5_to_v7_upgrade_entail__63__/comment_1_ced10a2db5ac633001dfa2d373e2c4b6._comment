I haven't had a data loss, but I wish I had waited to upgrade.  There are [[some issues|forum/lets_discuss_git_add_behavior]] with v7 semantics.  If you prefer v5 semantics, you can keep using an older git-annex version with your repos.  However, once you upgrade the repos (which recent git-annex versions do automatically without asking), there's no going back.
