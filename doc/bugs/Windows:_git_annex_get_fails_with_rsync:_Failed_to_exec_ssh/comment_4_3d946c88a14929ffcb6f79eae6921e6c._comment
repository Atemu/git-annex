Here's a request that rsync be added to git for windows. It seems like it
would be pretty easy for them to add. But I don't know if they will;
the bug is currently closed wontfix.
<https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/347>

I was finally able to get rsync working with git for windows and git-annex
as follows:

* Delete the rsync.exe that git-annex-installer.exe installs in Git/cmd
* Install <https://msys2.github.io/>
* In the msys2 shell, "pacman sync rsync"
* Copy /msys32/usr/bin/rsync.exe to /Program Files/Git/usr/bin/

So, I could include that rsync.exe in the git-annex for windows. However, since
there are 2 versions of rsync.exe, one which works with git for windows,
and one that works with msysgit, I might not be able to get a git-annex
build for windows that works with both of those versions of git at once.

If I do switch to only supporting git for windows, I could also drop some
bundled programs from git-annex-installer.exe. These programs are all
bundled with git for windows too:

* cp
* gpg
* shaNsum

Leaving only, I think, wget and curl and rsync to be bundled with
git-annex.
