Actually, even better it could be something like this

~~~
cat .gitannexinclude
+ *.ogg
+ *.mp3
+ > 100MB

- .*
- < 3MB
~~~

Any statement lower down overrides a statement higher up. Any file that does not match any of these patterns is automatically added to git. This will let us deprecate options like `largefiles` which are a source of lot of confusion for at least me.
