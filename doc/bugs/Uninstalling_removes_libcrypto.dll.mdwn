### Please describe the problem.
Just feedback to you:
After I uninstalled git-annex (Windows), traditional git was not able to push changes to an origin server via ssh.
Instead I got an error "libcrypto.dll is missing".
Installing git once again after uninstalling git-annex solved the problem.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Installing and uninstalling git-annex.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
File "git-annex-installer.exe" downloaded 2014-11-09.
Windows 8.

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

> [[fixed|done]]; git-annex no longer includes its own ssh, and uses the
> one from msysgit. --[[Joey]]
