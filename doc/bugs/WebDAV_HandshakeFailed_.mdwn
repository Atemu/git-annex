When I attempt to add a Box.com special remote to my annex I get the following error:

    git-annex: HandshakeFailed (Error_Protocol ("certificate rejected: certificate is not allowed to sign another certificate",True,CertificateUnknown))

Running git-annex version: 3.20130207

> Got that bug fixed in Debian and all builds updated. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
