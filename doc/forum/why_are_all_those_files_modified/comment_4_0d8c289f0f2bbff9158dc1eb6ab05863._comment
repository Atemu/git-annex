I reproduced as follows:

* Have a v7 repository, and unlock a couple of files.
* Clone to a v5 repository.
* Get the files into the v5 repository. (git annex get won't work on the
  unlocked files, but you can get --all or copy from the v7 to the v5 or
  whatever)
* Upgrade the v5 repository to v7.

Does that sequence match what you were doing? I didn't reproduce the
problem when just upgrading the v5 and then getting the unlocked files into it.

Seems that the upgrade to v7 process, after scanning for and populating
unlocked files, needs to update git's index. I thought it did, but perhaps
I forgot or that is not working.
