What steps will reproduce the problem?

> Building git-annex on the ghc7.0 branch on a Mac with the default case-insensitive file system

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

> Expected: build successfully; instead: 
     
    ld: duplicate symbol _UtilityziDiskFree_zdwa_info in dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/diskfree.o and dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/DiskFree.o for architecture x86_64

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

> commit `0bd5c90ef0518f75d52f0c5889422d8233df847d` on a Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7, using the Haskell Platform 2012.04

Please provide any additional information below.

> The problem is that since `DiskFree.hs` generates `DiskFree.o` and `diskfree.c` generates `diskfree.o`, a case-insensitive file system overwrites one object file with the other.  Renaming `diskfree.c` to `diskfreec.c` and changing the corresponding filenames in `git-annex.cabal` fixes the problem.
