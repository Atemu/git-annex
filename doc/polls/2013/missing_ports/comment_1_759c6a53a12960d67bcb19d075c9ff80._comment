Is an iOS port even a possibility?  It would be outstanding if it were.  Lately I've moved from using mostly-android for mobile purposes to mostly-iOS, and it makes me sad not to be able to use git annex directly.  Though I might eventually get around to having git-annex assistant running on a server at home which I can sftp to, and use it secondhand that way.
