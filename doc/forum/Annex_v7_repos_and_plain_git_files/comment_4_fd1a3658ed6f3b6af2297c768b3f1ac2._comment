P.S. It's a bit concerning if 7.20190912 is the default git-annex version in a common distro: it's the version most likely to confuse users with the changed `git add` behavior.  Can this be fixed?  Is it definitely the default version?   I don't know much about Ubuntu packaging, but from [https://packages.ubuntu.com/](https://packages.ubuntu.com/), 19.10 (`focal`) seems to have version [7.20191230](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/utils/git-annex)?
