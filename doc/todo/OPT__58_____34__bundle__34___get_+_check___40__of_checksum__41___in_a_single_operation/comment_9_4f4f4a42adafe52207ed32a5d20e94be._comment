Incremental hashing implemented for transfers over ssh and tor.

A good next step would be transfers to/from local git remotes.
Currently those use rsync, or cp for CoW. It does not make sense to trust
rsync's checksum verification here, because garbage in, garbage out --
rsync doesn't know what the hash should be and will happily transfer a
corrupted file. So instead, this would need to stop using rsync, and
instead implement our own file to file copying with resuming and incremental
hashing. Which would not be hard, and gets rid of the dependency on
rsync besides (except for talking with really old git-annex-ssh).

As for cp, CoW also suffers from GIGO, so I think the file will still
need to be read, after its copied, to make sure it has the expected
checksum.

Urk: Using rsync currently protects against
[[bugs/URL_key_potential_data_loss]], so the replacement would also need to
deal with that. Eg, by comparing the temp file content with the start of
the object when resuming.
