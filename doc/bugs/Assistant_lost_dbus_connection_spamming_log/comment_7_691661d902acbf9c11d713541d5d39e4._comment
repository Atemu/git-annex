Are you sure that the accept message happens every second? I don't see why the webapp would continue to try to bind a socket it it failed with a 1 second delay. (It does try 100 times if it fails, per [[!commit fe3009d83b08563875856152034e7c59a0c6ecca]], before ending with \"unable to bind to local socket\".)
