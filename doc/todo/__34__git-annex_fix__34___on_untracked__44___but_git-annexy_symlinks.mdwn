In my quest to get git-annex to do what I want, even if it is weird and unusual..

Would it be possible for 'git annex fix' to work even on untracked symlinks (perhaps only with '--force'?), where the symlink is otherwise in a git-annexy format?

This would allow me to do stuff like this:

   $ cd ~/old_broken_annex
   $ cp -t ~/other_annex/presentcheck *
   $ cd ~/other_annex/presentcheck

   ### This currently does nothing if the symlinks are untracked
   $ git annex fix --force .
   
   $ find -type l -not -xtype l -print0 | xargs -0 git add
   $ git commit -m "yay, we found some files!"
   $ find -type l -xtype l -print0 | xargs -0 mv -t ~/files_not_found

Admittedly, to do this now, you just have to stage the symlinks before you fix but there may be other situations where this is useful (and I can't think of anything else you would want 'fix --force' to do)..
