Is the relative path actually valid? There may be some case involving
symlinks in the parent directories where the relative path could be wrong.

I am not familiar with /private on OSX. Is the problem something like,
the user can access /private/foo/bar but not /private/foo, and so a
relative path traversing that can't find the ".." in that directory?

If so, then a relative path from /private/foo/bar to /private/foo/baz would
also fail and that case would not be helped by using an absolute
path to a different top level directory.

Of course, it's a bit surprising that a relative path is used when the path
is into an entirely different top-level directory. But without
understanding the problem I don't know if switching to using an absolute
path in that case would only happen to fix this case of the problem and not
the general case, whatever that is.

It's worth noting that git fails if a parent directory does not have
the x bit set:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/foo/bar/baz>git init
	fatal: Invalid path '/tmp/foo/bar': Permission denied
