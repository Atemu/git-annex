I suppose another way to fix it along similar lines would be to make `git annex copy` always trust location tracking information when deciding whether to copy. I'm not sure how I feel about this though -- it might make things less robust in situations where `git annex copy` is run as a backup, and location tracking could have gotten out of date.
