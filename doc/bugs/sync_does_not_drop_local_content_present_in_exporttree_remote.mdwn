`git annex sync --content` does not drop local unwanted content that
has been transferred to an exporttree remote.

This normally doesn't matter since exporttree remotes are untrusted, but
S3 with versioning enabled is not untrusted and once a file reaches such a
remote it should be able to be dropped locally. --[[Joey]]
