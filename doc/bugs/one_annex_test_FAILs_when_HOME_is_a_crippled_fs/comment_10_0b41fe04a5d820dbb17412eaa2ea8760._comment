Hmm, implemented all that, it did fix my shell test case.

But, the test suite is still hanging in the same place when run on vfat.

stracing the git-annex smudge command that is hung:

	fcntl(0, F_SETLKW, {l_type=F_WRLCK, l_whence=SEEK_SET, l_start=0, l_len=0}

fd 0 is .git/annex/gitqueue.lck

So hmm, this seems like a different problem than the one I fixed.
It's not involving pid locking.

The parent git-annex also has the same lock file open, and presumably
locked exclusively. So it makes sense it would deadlock, both the parent
and child trying to lock the same lock. It's kind of odd that this only
happens on vfat. I don't think this is because of vfat's limitations
though. It's a legitimate deadlock.

I get the feeling that gitAnnexGitQueueLock needs to be taken in a more
fine-grained way. Or Annex.Link should not be using the git queue
for what it does, which is not really a queue in the same way Git.Queue is
usually used. If Annex.Link instead deferred the action until cleanup in
some other way, it would not take gitAnnexGitQueueLock and so when it runs
smudge it would not matter if that did take the lock.

Unfortunately I'm out of time to fix it before today's planned release.
