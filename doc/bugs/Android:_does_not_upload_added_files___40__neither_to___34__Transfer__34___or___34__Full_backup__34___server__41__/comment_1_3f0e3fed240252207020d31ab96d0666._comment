The \"Invalid pid specified\" seems to point at the problem. (Or it's a nice red herring.) I cannot find this error message in either git-annex or in git. 

Enabling debug logging and restarting the assistant should produce a nice log that will both tell us what command it was running when that message showed up, and show some details about its preferred content decisions.
