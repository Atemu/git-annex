Kind of surprised it all came together so well today, especially because I
noticed another big problem with the design, but I was able to work around
that and import/export with preferred content works great.

I did end up limiting import to supported a subset of preferred
content expressions. Downloading content that it doesn't yet know if it
wants to import seemed too surprising and potentially very expensive.
