# NAME

git-annex copy - copy content of files to/from another repository

# SYNOPSIS

git annex copy `[path ...] [--from=remote|--to=remote]`

# DESCRIPTION

Copies the content of files from or to another remote.

# OPTIONS

* `--from=remote`

  Use this option to copy the content of files from the specified
  remote to the local repository.

* `--to=remote`

  Use this option to copy the content of files from the local repository
  to the specified remote.

* `--auto`

  Rather than copying all files, only copy files that don't yet have
  the desired number of copies, or that are preferred content of the
  destination repository. See [[git-annex-preferred-content]](1)

* `--fast`

  Avoid contacting the remote to check if it has every file when copying
  --to it.

* `--force`

  Force checking the remote for every file when copying --from it.

* `--all`

  Rather than specifying a filename or path to copy, this option can be
  used to copy all available versions of all files.

  This is the default behavior when running git-annex in a bare repository.

* `--unused`

  Operate on files found by last run of git-annex unused.

* `--key=keyname`

  Use this option to move a specified key.

* file matching options

  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to copy.
