The git-annex Windows port is not ready for prime time. But it does exist
now! --[[Joey]] 

## status

* git-annex fails to access a clone located on the local machine 
  (including other drives). It thinks that `c:\clone` is a ssh remote.
  (When Cygwin's build of git is used to make the clone, it puts the
  slashes the other way around in .git/config, which also doesn't work
  for git-annex.)
* test suite doesn't work
* Bad file locking, it's probably not safe to run more than one git-annex
  process at the same time on Windows.
* No support for the assistant or webapp.
