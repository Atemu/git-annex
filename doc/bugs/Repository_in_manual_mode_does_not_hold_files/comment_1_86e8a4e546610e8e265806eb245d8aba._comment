The preferred content setting for manual mode will try to clear out files that are in archive directories (once they reach an archive repository), but not other locations. I've re-tested it, and it still works that way. Perhaps your files are located inside archive directories; you don't say. If not, you will need to enable debug mode and show debug output.
