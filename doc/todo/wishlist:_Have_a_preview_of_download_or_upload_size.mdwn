When using SSH remote repository, git-annex uses rsync to download or upload files one at a time. I would like to have a preview of the overall transfer size so that I can estimate the transfer duration.

This could be done as an option of get, move or copy, or as a separated command.

If part of get, move or copy, git-annex could print how much has been done or how much left between every files.

Thanks.
