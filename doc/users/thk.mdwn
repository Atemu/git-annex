I'm thk at debian org


My TODO items

- write a tip on using git worktree to inspect the git-annex branch
  - Is there a way to filter out the directories?
- write a tip on how to deal with permission issues on ext formatted USB drives
  - works of course only on Debian and derivatives
  - use a common group defined in /usr/share/base-passwd/group.master, e.g. "floppy"
  - make the root folder sticky
  - make sure all users on all machines are part of the common group
- more experiences with ext4 encryption feature:
