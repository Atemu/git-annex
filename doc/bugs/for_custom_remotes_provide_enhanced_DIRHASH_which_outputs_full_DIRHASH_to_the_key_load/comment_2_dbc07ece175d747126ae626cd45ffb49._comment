Indeed I was just trying to get to the key's content (i.e. original archive from which to extract the load).  Indeed, new command would be lovely to have 

I started to wonder what would be faster though -- calling another git annex instance with that command or asking through the PIPE/interface?

P.S. I am scared to try any real tarball usecase and see how well it scales or not with all the ping-pong between external remote and annex ;)  I guess I will discover soon
