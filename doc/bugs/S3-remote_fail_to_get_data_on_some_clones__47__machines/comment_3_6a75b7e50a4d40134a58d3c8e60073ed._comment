Unfortunately --debug is all the debug info that's available.

One possibility that comes to mind is a http proxy. Perhaps curl is
using some proxy that is necessary to get data out, and git-annex is not.

By default, git-annex avoids connections to local IP adddresses,
for security reasons. If you have a local http proxy, it won't use it
either. You could try this:

	git config annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses any
