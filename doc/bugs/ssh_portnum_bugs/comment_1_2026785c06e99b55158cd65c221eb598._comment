I'm going to assume that the \"jessie/wheezy\" is a typo, since those are two completely different versions. It sounds to me like you were using the git-annex 3.x distributed with debian stable.

I cannot reproduce ssh port issues with the current release, and there have been ssh port fixes in the over 2 years since the version in Debian stable.
