Import tree won't help here. Actually I've got the same problem on one of my machines. I'm currently using a script that imports a bunch of files and moves them to the remote, then imports some more files and so on. It's quite cumbersome, to be honest. So yes, I'd appreciate `git annex import --to <remote>` as well. (Same with `git annex move --from remote-a --to remote-b` actually.)
