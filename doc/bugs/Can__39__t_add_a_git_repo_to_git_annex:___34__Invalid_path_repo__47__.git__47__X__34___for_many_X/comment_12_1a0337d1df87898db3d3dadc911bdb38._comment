Just adding my voice to the choir: My use case is very similar to Abd√≥'s and git-annex not handling nested git repos is what stopped me from taking it into use sometime ago when I tried it. To me submodules would seem like a good way to handle this, but others here clearly understand git better than I do so I don't have much to add.
