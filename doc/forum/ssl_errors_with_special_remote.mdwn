i recently have tried setting up my own webdav server to setup as a special remote for my git annex repositories.  This webdav server has been placed behind a reverse proxy.  At one point i ran into an issue with my reverse proxy and ended up having to get new sll certificates for it.  Now  whenever i try to push something to my webdav server i get this error 

(InternalException (HandshakeFailed (Error_Protocol ("certificate has expired",True,CertificateExpired))))) failed

i know my certificates are good because i am able to access the site normally and push from my other machine which had only gained access to the webdav server after the SSL certificate change.  

is it possible to flush the known SSL certificates from git-annex?
