It'd be nice to be able to run "git annex version" -- and maybe some other
commands, like "git annex" itself for the help text, without having to be
inside a git repo. Right now it requires you to be in a git repo even if
it's not a git-annex repo.

	joey@gnu:/>git annex version
	git-annex version: 3.20120124
