### Please describe the problem.

git annex will automatically create the file

.kde/share/kde4/services/ServiceMenus/git-annex.desktop

However the actions created do not work because the variable used is %U (file:/// style URL) which git annex does not understand.

According to http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html

Also the escaping seems broken. The following line is one that works for me.

    Exec=sh -c 'cd "$(dirname -- "$1")" && git-annex get --notify-start --notify-finish -- "$1"' command_string_is_ignored %f

or simply

    Exec=git-annex get --notify-start --notify-finish -- %F

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
