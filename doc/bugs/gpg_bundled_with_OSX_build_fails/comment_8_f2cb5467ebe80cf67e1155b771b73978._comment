That's not the same error (2 != 5), and posting comments to long-closed bugs is never a good idea if your goal is to report a current bug in a way that will ensure it's noticed and that anyone remembers to follow up on it. You should file a new bug report, and include whatever actual error message is output *before* the message you pasted.
