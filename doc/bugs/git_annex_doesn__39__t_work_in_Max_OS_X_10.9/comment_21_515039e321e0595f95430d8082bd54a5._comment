Now that I can try running the 10.8 dmg on 10.9 myself, I get this failure:

<pre>
oberon:~ joeyh$ /Volumes/git-annex/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex
dyld: Symbol not found: _objc_debug_taggedpointer_mask
  Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation
  Expected in: /Volumes/git-annex/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/I
 in /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation
</pre>

This makes me think that that adding back the OSX frameworks might possibly yield a dmg that can work on both versions. Although that's probably more likely to work if it's built on 10.8 and used on 10.9 than the other way around. Might be worth a try to revert commit 900351ab8585c171486cef853eff4a95ec151e6f and commit 9b663c7f8cf82cee523b75be1a8786fa7d34b428 to try that.

Oh well, I should have a native 10.9 dmg autobuild set up before too long. 10.8 autobuilder has built its last image unfortunately, due to being upgraded to 10.9.
