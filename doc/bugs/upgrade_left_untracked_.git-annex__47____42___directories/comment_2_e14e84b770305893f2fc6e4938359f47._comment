'git add .git-annex' didn't do anything.  That's when I noticed that this
repository is on a case-insensitive HFS+ file system.

So, if I get this right it's not a new bug, but similar to this situation:
[[git-annex_directory_hashing_problems_on_osx]]

Assuming that it was the file system's fault, I went ahead and upgraded yet
another clone.  That one (on an ext3 file system) had neither staged changes
nor left-over untracked files.  Everything seems to just have fallen right into
place.  Is that possible or still weird?
