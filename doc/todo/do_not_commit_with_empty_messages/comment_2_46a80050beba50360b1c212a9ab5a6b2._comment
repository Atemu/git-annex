i agree. this does seems like a bug in git. i tried various ways of coercing git into doing what i need, but in the end just ended up adding comments to those commits.

i thought of reporting this to the mailing list, but it turns out there's already patches floating around to fix a bunch of issues with rebase:

<http://search.gmane.org/?query=rebase+empty+commit+message&group=gmane.comp.version-control.git>

in particular:

<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/255411/>

not sure what those will become.
