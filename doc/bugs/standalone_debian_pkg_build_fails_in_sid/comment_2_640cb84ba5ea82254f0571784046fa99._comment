This is a reversion due to [[!commit 39fbaa0682198ba0fd8aa437b8382b13fb71e66f]]
that breaks any part of a git-annex command that uses exitWith since that
is actually implemented as an exception which now gets caught.

(Seems that when I tried the test suite after that commit I stopped reading
at the "All 293 tests passed" because it does always go on to fail.)
