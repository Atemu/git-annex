I'm sure I messed up the repository at some point

the remote repository have a duplicated (I hope just duplicated and not triplicated) UUID: both ffc5c5d1-6166-4753-a2e4-88727d0f8c7b and 984e0333-3327-5f21-87a1-35d30f37f337

on one of my working remotes I already used \"git annex dead 984e0333-3327-5f21-87a1-35d30f37f337\" and synced the special (bare) remote **but** trying to make a new clone and adding the remote special with enableremote i always get the same \"UUID mismatch\" error, listing the (marked) dead UUID

please is there a way to get rid of the mess I did?!? :-)
I'm tempted to manually add \"annex-uuid = ffc5c5d1-6166-4753-a2e4-88727d0f8c7b\" to the repo \".git/config\" but I fear I'm going to further mess things

sorry for reportng this as a bug... actually it was my fault

best regards
Giovanni
