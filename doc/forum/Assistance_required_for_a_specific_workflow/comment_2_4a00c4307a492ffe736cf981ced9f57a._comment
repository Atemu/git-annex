You should not need to untrust any repository to do this kind of thing.
Only use untrust if you really expect that a repository could lose data at
any time. So while Ilya's suggestion will technically work, I don't
think it's a good idea.

By setting the special remotes to "incremental backup", you've told git-annex
you only want one copy of the file spread amoung all of them whenever possible.
So you've shot yourself in the foot there if your goal is to have more than one
copy of the file amoung the special remotes. 

The easiest thing to do is pick some of the special remotes to be "archive"
and keep the rest "incremental backup", and each file will be stored twice,
once in each of those two different types of repositories.

There is also a paragraph in [[preferred_content/standard_groups]] that
explains how to configure archive repositories to keep more than one copy,
and following this could let you use only archive repositories and have them
keep as many copies as you eventually want:

   Note that if you want to archive multiple copies (not a bad idea!),
   you can set `git-annex groupwanted archive` to a version of
   the above preferred content expression with a larger number of copies
   than 1. Then make the archive repositories have a preferred
   content expression of "groupwanted" in order to use your modified
   version.

Ie:

	git annex groupwanted archive "(not (copies=archive:2 or copies=smallarchive:2)) or approxlackingcopies=1"
	git annex group boxdotcom archive
	git annex group othercloud archive
	git annex wanted boxdotcom groupwanted
	git annex wanted othercloud groupwanted
