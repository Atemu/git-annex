Appears to be a corrupt uuid log issue. At least, the bug I am seeing is. When retriving the uuid of the remote that has the key from the location log, it seems to get a uuid with one or more \r appended to it. Which smells of windows.

However, the bug I am seeing makes `git annex get` print out the uuids of the remotes without the description it normally shows (because these are not really the same uuids due to the \r). In the example above, this is not the case; the description is shown. I don't understand that.
