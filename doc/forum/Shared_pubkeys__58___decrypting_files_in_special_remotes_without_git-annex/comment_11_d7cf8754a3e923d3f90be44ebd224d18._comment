The original script with sharedpubkey support is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliv5/profile/master/pbin/git-annex-decrypt.sh)

Yibe's enhanced script with sharedpubkey, different mac and chunk support is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliv5/profile/master/pbin/git-annex-decrypt-2.sh). Chunk management should be verified before relying on it, I haven't done it yet except for a basic case (1 chunk per file). Mac support seems ok.
