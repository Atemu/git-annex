> Andrew:
> \" I have three repos listed at `~/.config/git-annex/autostart`. If I run `git-annex assistant --autostart` from one of my repo directories, then an assistant daemon is started for each repo, I can verify that with `ps aux | grep \"git-annex assistant --startdelay\"` which lists one assistant process per repository (3 total). If I start the assistants this way, they seem to stick around. Then, I can follow the mentioned archiving video and successfully sync/archive as shown. \"

I have only one repo listed at `~/.config/git-annex/autostart` which is my laptop. The other repo was created with the webapp on a USB drive; it is bare and will not allow me to start an assistant on it.  Again, I cannot successfully sync/archive as shown in the archiving video.

I tried using `git-annex version: 6.20180509-gd801a3318` but no help.

FYI, I also noticed that clicking the .app now successfully opens the webapp again.
