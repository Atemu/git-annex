Test case for the annex.thin with modified file bug:

	git annex init
	git annex upgrade
	git config annex.thin true
	touch foo
	git add foo
	git commit -m add
	echo foo >> foo
	rm foo
	git commit -m rm -a
	git annex unused
	git annex dropunused 1
	git annex unused

Now, dropunused is supposed to honor numcopies, and if an object file
has been modified, that's probably the only existing copy of that object,
and so dropunused should refuse to drop it by default. There ought to be a
warning, and the user should be able to use --force to override and drop it
anyway. I've implemented that now.
