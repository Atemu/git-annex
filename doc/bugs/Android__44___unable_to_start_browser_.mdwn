### Please describe the problem.

When launching git annex webapp in Termux the browser does not open.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git-annex is installed in android termux according to installation instructions
I execute the "git annex webapp" command in termux and I get this error:
Launching web browser on http://127.0.0.1:59394/........
/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/am: 4: exec: /system/bin/app_process: Operation not permitted

So the browser does not automatically open with the webapp.
If I manually open the browser and I copy-paste the url to it, then it works.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
7.20190219-g728228d5d for android


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Not yet: I tried to use it some years ago to handle my photo collection but I think digikam didn't like the sim links and it was very slow; I also was not lucky with the external (NTFS) drive that I used for sync/backup.
But I like this project so much that I frequently come back to check for updates and test myself with it.
