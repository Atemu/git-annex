Thanks for the explanation about the S3 keys and signature. I was able to set up a backblaze b2 special remote with an eu endpoint. The cost information on [this page on the go version of the b2 remote](https://github.com/encryptio/git-annex-remote-b2#improving-the-financial-cost-of-this-remote) is interesting - is it accurate?
