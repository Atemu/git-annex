For using [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage)
as a special remote, there are currently three choices:

* Google Cloud Storage supports supports the same API as Amazon S3, so
  git-annex's built-in [[S3 special remote|special_remotes/S3]] can be used
  with it. You may need to configure Google Cloud Storage to allow
  "Interoperable Access". Here is how to set up the special remote:

	git annex initremote cloud type=S3 encryption=none host=storage.googleapis.com port=80

* Alternatively, rclone supports Google Cloud Storage's native API,
  so the [[rclone_special_remote|special_remotes/rclone]] can be used.

* Alternatively, there is a dedicated special remote,

At this time it's not clear which is better, so if you find one works
best, please comment below.
