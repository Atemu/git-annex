`git annex adjust` and `git annex view` (et all) both derive a branch from
the main branch and enter it. They have different capabilies. It would be
useful to be able to compose them. For example, to enter a view based on
metadata that also has all files unlocked.

There's also probably a fair amount of overlap in their implementations.
