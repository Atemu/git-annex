If you want to be able to drop files into your server repo directly and have those files seen by git-annex and then synced back to your laptop you will need your server repo to be non-bare (IE a normal full git repository). Bare repositories are never monitored by git-annex assistant ([see somewhat related comments on that here](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/OSX_Assistant_will_not_automatically_drop/#comment-e81c8bac6a39c90692a3eb695c8dc416)).
