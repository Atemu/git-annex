Many special remotes can potentially end up exposed in public http. There
is not currently a way to access them over http, without adding per-remote
support (like S3 has).

But generally the filenames used are the same, eg rsync and directory and
webdav and S3. Or if there are differences, they are generally small and
trying a couple of different urls is doable.

And sameas allows for

now.

So, there could be a new special remote type, that allows generic readonly
access of other special remotes whose data stores are exposed via http.

Call it "http" maybe. (There may be some confusion between this and the web
special remote by users looking for such a thing.) --[[Joey]]
