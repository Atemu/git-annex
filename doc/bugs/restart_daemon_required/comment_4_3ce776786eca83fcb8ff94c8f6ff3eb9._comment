Darren, I'm sorry about the delay getting back to you -- I've been on vacation.

> XMPPClient: received: [\"Unknown message\"]

This and the versions tell me what the problem is. Version 4.20130601 made a backwards-incompatable change in its XMPP protocol.
You need to upgrade the one that's using 4.20130522, and that'll solve that. The current build for Lion is 4.20130601, which will do. (The Lion autobuild is also building again for some time.)

I forgot to mention this protocol change in the release notes, it was only in the changelog. Am doing that now.
