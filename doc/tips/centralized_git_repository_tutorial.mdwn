The [[walkthrough]] builds up a decentralized git repository setup, but
git-annex can also be used with a centralized git repository. 

We have separate tutorials depending on where the centralized git
repository is hosted.

* You can use GitHub. However, GitHub does not currently let git-annex
  store the contents of large files there. So, things get a little more
  complicated. See [[centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_GitHub]]
  for a tutorial for using git-annex with GitHub.

* You can use GitLab. This service is similar to GitHub, but supports
  git-annex. See [[centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_GitLab]]

* You can use your own git server, which can be any unix system with
  ssh and git and git-annex installed. A VPS, a home server, etc.
  See [[[[centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_your_own_server]].
