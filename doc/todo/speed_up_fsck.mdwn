moving to the git-annex branch has slowed down fsck worse than most
commands. Actually, some commands have sped up, while others like get
are slightly slower but are swamped by the normal runtime. 

For fsck though, it has to pull each file's location log info out of git.
And, it's typically run on the entire tree.

It would be possible to run a single `git cat-file --batch` and pass it
sha1s of location logs for file that is going to be fsked (gotten via
`read-tree`). Then just read its output until the next requested sha1 to
chunk it, and pass this in to fsck in a closure.

The difficulty, besides writing that is that everything that works with
location logs now reads them out of git, would need to find a way to
provide the info on a side channel of some sort.

If this is implemented, the same infrastructure could be used for other
commands like whereis and add. --[[Joey]]
