### Please describe the problem.

Hi,

On OSX the web-app keeps notifying me of an upgrade, I choose to run it but nothing seems to happen.

The debug logs show that the upgrade is skipped as it's redundant.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Have upgrades set to notify.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Current.

### Please provide any additional information below.

# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.

[2014-04-25 08:27:02 BST] main: Skipping redundant upgrade

# End of transcript or log.
