Seems the git-annex-bin package is no longer in AUR.

@caleb any interesting in resurrecting the old git-annex-bin package?

It would be a welcome option for users that have no other haskell-based packages installed vs. the community/git-annex package that now depends on ghc and *many* separate haskell packages. Reply or ping me, I can assist.
