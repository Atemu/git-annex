### Please describe the problem.

`/usr/bin/git-annex-shell` is linked to `/usr/lib/git-annex.linux/git-annex`, not `/usr/lib/git-annex.linux/git-annex-shell` after installing from git annex standalone rpm using yum.

As a result, commands passed through `git-annex-shell` don't work, but other functions I tried work properly (e.g. initializing repos, adding files). I found the bug after running `git annex get myawesomefile` and getting a confusing error message about `git-annex` usage.

Running `/usr/lib/git-annex.linux/git-annex-shell configlist ~/path/to/my/repo` would produce correct output, but `/usr/bin/git-annex-shell configlist ~/path/to/my/repo` would raise errors. Relinking `/usr/bin/git-annex-shell` seems to have fixed the problem.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

- Install git annex following these steps: https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/rpm_standalone/
- Run any `git-annex-shell` command. In my case, `git-annex-shell configlist ~/path/to/my/repo`.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

operating system: linux x86_64  (CentOS 7)

### Please provide any additional information below.

Here is output from one time I tried to run `git-annex-shell` over ssh. Note that the error message gives usage for `git-annex`, not `git-annex-shell`.

[[!format sh """
$ ssh username@my.remote.server 'git-annex-shell configlist ~/path/to/my/repo'
Invalid argument `configlist'

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Git annex does exactly what I want, without the complicated setup or fees of git lfs. Thanks for your work maintaining this project!
