The problem seems to involve git check-attr exiting unexpectedly. Does this happen only in a specific directory of files, or can you reproduce it elsewhere?

You may be able to reproduce it exiting by running:

`git check-attr --stdin annex.backend annex.numcopies --`

And then entering filenames, pressing enter, and it should answer back with two attribute values and keep running.
