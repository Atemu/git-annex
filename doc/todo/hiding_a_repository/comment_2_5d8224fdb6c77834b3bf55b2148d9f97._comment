Hmm, good point because --all looks at the location logs to get a list of
keys, and so if it did not create the log at all, --all would not find it.

So I guess it would need to write an empty log in that case, rather than
omitting writing a log at all. Which does indicate a hidden repo added a
file, if someone is curious about how they're being used.
