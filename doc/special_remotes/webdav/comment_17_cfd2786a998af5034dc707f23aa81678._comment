When I try to use a WebDAV server as remote storage, \"git annex initremote\" stops with the error message

```
git-annex: Unknown remote type webdav (pick from: git gcrypt p2p S3 bup directory rsync web bittorrent adb tahoe glacier ddar git-lfs hook external)
```

This looks like I need to explicitly add WebDAV support, but then this page says that it is built in.

I installed git-annex via Guix, so I checked the Guix package definition where I found the configuration flag \"-WebDAV\". I didn't find any documentation on this flag, nor configuration flags in general, so I don't know if this asks for including or excluding WebDAV support (or maybe even something completely different). So I compiled git-annex under Guix both with and without this flag. In both cases, the build log includes the lines

```
   BuildFlags.hs:42:2: error:
        warning: #warning Building without WebDAV. [-Wcpp]
        #warning Building without WebDAV.
         ^~~~~~~
      |
   42 | #warning Building without WebDAV.
      |  ^
```

There is no further explanation, so I have no idea why WebDAV was excluded. Any suggestions? I am completely unfamiliar with Haskell and its build system, so I don't even know how to explore this any further.
