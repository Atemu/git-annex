In fact, it seems you'd _always_ have to treat external-backend keys as unverified by default, and require explicit configuration to override that?  Even if an external backend claims to compute a cryptographically secure hash, you can't guarantee that it does.  It seems that the handling should be exactly as for URL/WORM keys, except that, instead of completely disabling verification with `annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads`, the user could enable verification by an external backend implementation which the user trusts.
