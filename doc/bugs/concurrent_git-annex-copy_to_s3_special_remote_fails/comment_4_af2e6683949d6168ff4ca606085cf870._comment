Thinking about this, one thing in git-annex that might somehow involve
unsafe memory access would be if Remote.S3's use of runResourceT returns
a value that depends on a resource that then gets freed.

[[!commit ddf963d0194acf9f6f059fa37f3e89e59d682de9]] should avoid all ways that might possibly have happened,
so if anyone has a way to reproduce this reliably, it would be good to know
if it still happens after that fix.
