For some reason the test suite on windows is failing to set up the direct
mode repo; git-annex direct fails because the repo is a v7 repo in adjusted
unlocked mode.

I have not managed to reproduce this outside of the test suite.

Hmm, I reordered the direct mode tests to come first, and the failure went
away. Think that .t/repo gets reused somehow, and being already a v7 repo, 
git annex init --version=7 silently did not change it. (Now it will error
out instead.)

.t/repo is supposed to be deleted between each pass, but deleting
directories on Windows is a fairly probabalistic venture. It would be
better to use a different repo path for each pass. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
