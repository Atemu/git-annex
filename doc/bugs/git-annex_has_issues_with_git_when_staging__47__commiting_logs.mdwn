After a series of pretty convoluted copying files around between annex'd repos and pulling changes around between repos. I noticed that occassionally when git-annex tries to stage files (the `.git-annex/*/*/*logs`) git some times gets wedged and doing a "git commit -a" doesn't seem to work or files might not get added thus leaving a bunch of untracked files or modified files that aren't staged for a commit.

I tried running a *`git rm --cached -f -r *`* then *git add -u .git-annex/* or the usual *git add* then a commit fixes things for me. If I don't do that then my subsequent merges/pulls will fail and result in *no known copies of files* I suspect git-annex might have just touched some file modes and git picked up the changes but got confused since there was no content change. It might also just be a git on OSX thing and it doesn't affect linux/bsd users.

For now it's just a bit of extra work for me when it does occur but it does not seem to occur often.

>> It "got wedged" as in git doesn't let me commit anything, even though it tells me that there is stuff to be committed in the staging area.
