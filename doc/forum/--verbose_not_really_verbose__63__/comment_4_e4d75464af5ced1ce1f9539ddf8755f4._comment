Well, I wouldn't need any specialised synchronisation tool if I had 1000 files.

My \"sdcard\", which is not really an SD card (Android lying as always), has ~400 000 files, out of which a huge load are garbage files created by poorly written apps which you cannot avoid, like a bank-client, which are unmanageable from a phone itself. 

I hoped to pull them to the laptop, do the heavy lifting of sorting that out on the laptop, using fdupes, rdfind, find/grep, and such, delete the rubbish, and push it back. 

It's not an \"exotic\" setup at all, I don't even have my phone rooted. In fact for about a year or two a phone with 128Gb of storage is fairly affordable. And it's not really possible to stop apps from being garbage.
