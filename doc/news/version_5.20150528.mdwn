git-annex 5.20150528 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * fromkey, registerurl: Allow urls to be specified instead of keys,
     and generate URL keys.
   * Linux standalone, OSX app: Improve runshell script to always quote
     shell vars, so that it will work when eg, untarred into a directory
     path with spaces in its name.
   * Revert removal dependency on obsolete hamlet package, since the
     autobuilders are not ready for this change yet and it prevented them
     from building the webapp. Reopens: #786659
   * fsck: When checksumming a file fails due to a hardware fault,
     the file is now moved to the bad directory, and the fsck proceeds.
     Before, the fsck immediately failed.
   * Linux standalone: The webapp was not built in the previous release,
     this release fixes that oversight."""]]
