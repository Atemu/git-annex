This weird message is coming from whatever equivilant bitbucket has of a login shell.

I'd expect you would only see the message once. When git-annex notices it cannot run git-annex-shell on the remote, it automatically sets `remote.bitbucket.annex-ignore`. Once that is set, it will not try again to send/receive files from the remote. But due to the recent change I made, will still git push/pull to it.

I don't see anything unexpected in the logs.. What would be unexpected is if `remote.bitbucket.annex-ignore` is set, and it tries to do this again next time it syncs. Or if `remote.bitbucket.annex-ignore` is not set to true in `.git/config`.

Here is an example of how it's supposed to work:

<pre>
joey@gnu:~/tmp/rr>git annex sync
fatal: unrecognized command 'git-annex-shell 'configlist' '/~/test.git''

  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting remote.origin.annex-ignore
commit  
ok

joey@gnu:~/tmp/rr>git config remote.origin.annex-ignore 
true

joey@gnu:~/tmp/rr>git annex sync
commit  
ok
</pre>
