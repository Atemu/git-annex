Seems that a fairly common desire in some use cases is to be able to make a
clone of a repository and be able to get files, without updating the
location tracking information. (And without even recording a uuid in the
remote.log.) Use cases include wanting to have temporary
clones without cluttering history, and centralized development where the
developers don't care to know about one-another's systems.

It seems that such an untracked repository would need to automatically
consider itself untrusted. Is that enough to avoid losing data?
