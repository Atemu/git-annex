Oh what a dumb mistake, literally a copied "False" that should be "True".

I'm going to move the next release up due to this regression, but
thankfully it doesn't result in data loss, so am not going to do a crash
priority release. Probably Monday.

The test suite also has a test case for move and numcopies now. It used to be
ok for it to only test drop and numcopies, but that changed a while back
and it should have had one already.
