No setup information found for ghc-8.4.4 on your platform.
This probably means a GHC bindist has not yet been added for OS key 'linux64-gmp4'.
Supported versions: ghc-7.8.4, ghc-7.10.2, ghc-7.10.3, ghc-8.0.1, ghc-8.0.2, ghc-8.2.1, ghc-8.2.2, ghc-8.4.2

Is there a way to specify that ghc-8.4.2 is ok (if it is ok)?
