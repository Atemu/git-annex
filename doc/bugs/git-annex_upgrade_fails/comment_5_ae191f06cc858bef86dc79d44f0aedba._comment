Seems like git-annex should report on that.  Simply saying \"git-annex: upgrade: 1 failed\" because git is 2.21 is extremely unhelpful.  If git-annex requires a certain version of git, it should test for that and be explicit about that requirement in its error output.  I needed this comment in order to resolve the issue.

For me, 2.21 is just what macOS ships with.
