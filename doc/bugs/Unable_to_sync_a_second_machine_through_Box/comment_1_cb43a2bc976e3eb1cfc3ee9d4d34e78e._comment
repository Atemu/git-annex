Are files that you add in machine A showing up in machine B as broken symlinks? If so, jabber sync is working and the problem is with the Box.com remore. If not, the problem must be with the jabber sync.

The log includes something like this when git is pulling over jabber:

You can turn on debugging (--debug at startup or Enable debug logging in Configuration -> Preferences) to get full XMPP protocol dumps in the log. If you do not see something like the above, please do so, and paste them, so I can debug why it's not working.

This is normal; it doesn't make sense to change the directory the remote uses once the remote is in use.
