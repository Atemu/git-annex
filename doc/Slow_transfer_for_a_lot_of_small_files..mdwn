What steps will reproduce the problem?
Sync a lot of small files.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
The expected output is hopefully a fast transfer.

But currently it seems like git-annex is only using one thread to transfer(per host or total?)

An option to select number of transfer threads to use(possibly per host) would be very nice.

And maybe also an option to limit how long a queue the browser should show, it can become quite resource intensive with a long queue.
