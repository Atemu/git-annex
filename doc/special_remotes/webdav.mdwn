This special remote type stores file contents in a WebDAV server.

## configuration

The environment variables `WEBDAV_USERNAME` and `WEBDAV_PASSWORD` are used
to supply login credentials. When encryption is enabled, they are stored in
encrypted form by `git annex initremote`. Without encryption, they are
stored in a file only you can read inside the local git repository. So you
do not need to keep the environment variables set after the initial
initalization of the remote.

A number of parameters can be passed to `git annex initremote` to configure
the webdav remote.

* `encryption` - Required. Either "none" to disable encryption
  (not recommended),
  or a value that can be looked up (using gpg -k) to find a gpg encryption
  key that will be given access to the remote. Note that additional gpg
  keys can be given access to a remote by rerunning initremote with
  the new key id. See [[encryption]].

* `url` - Required. The URL to the WebDAV directory where files will be
  stored. This directory must already exist. Use of a https URL is strongly
  encouraged, since HTTP basic authentication is used.

* `chunksize` - Avoid storing files larger than the specified size in
  WebDAV. For use when the WebDAV server has file size
  limitations. The default is to never chunk files.  
  The value can use specified using any commonly used units.
  Example: `chunksize=100 megabytes`  
  Note that enabling chunking on an existing remote with non-chunked
  files is not recommended.

Setup example:

	# WEBDAV_USERNAME=joey@kitenet.net WEBDAV_PASSWORD=xxxxxxx git annex initremote box.com type=webdav url=https://www.box.com/dav/ encryption=joey@kitenet.net
