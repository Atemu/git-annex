## Use Case

I want to import a bunch of files that are hosted somewhere, they nicely sorted by year and such. Instead of addurl'ing each by hand (or writing a custom script each time this happens) I want to simply:

git-annex addurl --recursive http://somehost.tld/somedir/

For sanity, mimicking wget closely with default depth of 5, but customizable with the --level switch.
