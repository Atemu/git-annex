It is indeed strange that it runs it twice. That must be a significant
clue.

Since it also displays "(from origin)" twice, it seems that somehow
git-annex thinks there are two different remotes, both somehow named
"origin", and when the first doesn't work, it moves on to try the second.

That should not be possible at all. Even if your .git/config
had two origin stanzas, you would not see this behavior.

Also, after operating on 2 "origin" remotes, it then only lists origin once
in "Unable to access these remotes: origin", but if there are somehow two
origin remotes, it would have to list them both there too.

So none of this is making any sense, on multiple levels.

There must be something in the configuration of your repo that explains
this behavior, but I can't guess what it is. If you can show a transcript
of creating new repos in a way that reproduces this behavior, it would
help.
