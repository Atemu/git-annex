I have been using V6 more and more over the past weeks, and it is working pretty well for me so far.

If you are now on the final straight, how will parallelization be trigger (i.e. git annex add --jobs ...) when everything runs (or could run) implicitly through the normal Git API.

Thanks for making this happen!
