### Please describe the problem.

Getting a file from a read-only remote fails with the following error:

[[!format sh """
$ git annex get somefile.avi
get somefile.avi (from some.repo...)
git-annex: ../../../home/annex/repo/.git/annex/transfer/upload/9bxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxb4/lck.SHA256E-sxxxxxxx52--xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx8c.avi: openFd: does not exist (No su

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Locally git-annex 5.20141125 on debian/jessie, remotely 5.20150727 on FreeBSD.

### Please provide any additional information below.

Using `ps` I got the command executed on the remote side. Running it directly gives:

[[!format sh """
$ git-annex-shell sendkey /home/annex/repo SHA256E-sxxxxxxx52--xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx8c.avi --uuid 9axxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxde -- remoteuuid=9bxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxb4 direct= associatedfile=somefile.avi -- dummy rsync --server --sender -pe.Lsfx --inplace . .
git-annex: ../../../home/annex/repo/.git/annex/transfer/upload/9bxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxb4/lck.SHA256E-sxxxxxxx52--xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx8c.avi: openFd: does not exist (No such file or directory)
failed
git-annex-shell: sendkey: 1 failed
"""]]

The remote repository is marked as read-only. The user on the remote has only read-only access to the git-annex repository.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes! :-) Despite this, everything works like a charm with several repos on different OSs with lots of data. Thanks for this great tool!
