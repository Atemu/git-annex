I updated haskell platform, and now

<pre>
[jtang@x00 git-annex (master)]$ make test

test.hs:11:8:

Looks like a missing dep somewhere with testpack or quickcheck... I haven't had time to figure it out yet, its not git-annex specific but I thought I might log it as a reminder for myself just in case if the osxapp is more borked than usual, I probably need to flush my .cabal directory of installed userland dependancies.
