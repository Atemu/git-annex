Normally annexed files are huge binary files. Line-by-line diff of such
files is unlikely to be useful.

So you would need some domain-specific diff for the kind of binary files
you are storing in git-annex. If you have one, you can use
[[git-annex-diffdriver]] to make git use it when diffing annexed files.

Not seeing anything more I can do here, so I'm going to close this todo.
