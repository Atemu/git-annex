I think I found the problem, after much googling.

The command line you suggest is indeed tried, and rejected by the server.

The answer came from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/253055/how-do-i-push-amended-commit-to-the-remote-git-repo) where it says (speaking of a forced push)

> Even this may not work as git allows remote repositories to refuse non-fastforward pushes at the far end by using the config variable 'receive.denynonfastforwards'.

Indeed this is set in my annex repository. Note that this is a local setting, and that repository was created by the assistant.

I removed this setting, and I can now push. Could the setting of this bit be a bug in the assistant?

In any case, thanks a lot for indicating where to look at.
