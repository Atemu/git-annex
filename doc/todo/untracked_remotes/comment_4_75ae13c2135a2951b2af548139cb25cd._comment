Another use case of read-only repos:

Instead of merging pull requests or anything, with git-annex, it makes most sense to simply set up the other party as a remote and `git annex sync`.
This will attempt to push to the other remote.

In this specific case:

    % git annex sync
    commit  
    ok
    pull origin 
    ok
    pull greggrossmeier 
    ok
    push origin
