Makes sense.  It's certainly better if import/export did complementary things.  Maybe, move the old `git-annex-import` functionality to a new command called `git-annex-ingest`?

\"everything not involving importing from a special remote should be deprecated\" -- i.e. to ingest a directory you'd first create a directory special remote for it, and then `git-annex-import` from that?
