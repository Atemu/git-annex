### Please describe the problem.
Trying to apply certain commands - such as 'drop' - to a filename which starts with "-c" instead applies it to all files.  In the instance where I found this, I was using "drop --force" and it caused it to indiscriminately get rid of everything in the directory instead of a single file.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Make a repository.
2. Create several files and add them.
3. Create a file whose name begins with "-c" and add it as well.
4. Run "git annex drop <fname>" where 'fname' is the file from that last step. 

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
4.20130516-gedc4ccd on Arch Linux

### Please provide any additional information below.
