git-annex 5.20131230 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Added new external special remote interface.
   * importfeed: Support youtube playlists.
   * Add tasty to build-depends, so that test suite builds again.
     (tasty was stuck in incoming.)
   * Fix typo in test suite.
   * Fix bug in Linux standalone build's shimming that broke git-annex-shell.
   * Include git-receive-pack, git-upload-pack, git, and git-shell wrappers
     in the Linux standalone build, and OSX app, so they will be available
     when it's added to PATH.
   * addurl, importfeed: Sanitize | and some other symbols and special
     characters.
   * Auto-upgrade v3 indirect repos to v5 with no changes.
     This also fixes a problem when a direct mode repo was somehow set to v3
     rather than v4, and so the automatic direct mode upgrade to v5 was not
     done.
   * Android: Avoid trying to use Android's own ionice, which does not
     allow specifying a command to run. Fixes transferring files to/from
     android and probably a few other things."""]]
