We have a way to run the regular git-annex build for linux on Android in termux:
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/install_on_Android_in_Termux/>

So you can use the x86 autobuild on android now. I don't currently have a
mips autobuild, but you can build git-annex on a Debian mips system
with "make linuxstandalone" and the resulting tarball should work with the
above instructions on a mips android system, presumably.
