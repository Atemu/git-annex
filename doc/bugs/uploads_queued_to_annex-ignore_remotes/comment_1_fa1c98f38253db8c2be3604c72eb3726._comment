I was able to find two ways this could happen:

* When a removable drive was attached and the annex-ignored repository was on it.
* When the network connection went down and came back up.

In either case, it would git sync with the ignored repository. And in some cases could scan it for transfers.

I've pushed a fix for these two cases. If you can try the next autobuild, that would be helpful.

If you continue to see this happening, you should enable debug logging, and send a log after it happens.
