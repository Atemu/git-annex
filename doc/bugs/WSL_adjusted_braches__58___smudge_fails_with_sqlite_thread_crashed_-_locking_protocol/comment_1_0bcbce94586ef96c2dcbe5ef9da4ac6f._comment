I have seen several sqlite-related problems in WSL, they seem to come and
go for me.

I guess this is WSL not emulating Linux very well and so breaking sqlite.
There is not much that git-annex can do about it.

(Here's stack having to work around a similar problem 
https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/4876 and the error
message looks very similar. But git-annex
cannot afford to disable WAL mode as that would break concurrent operation.)

I hear they've given up on emulating Linux syscalls and the next version of
WSL will just use the Linux kernel. Which should avoid this problem.
