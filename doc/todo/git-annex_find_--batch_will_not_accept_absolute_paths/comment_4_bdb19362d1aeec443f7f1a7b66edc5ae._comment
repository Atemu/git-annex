Other commands like whereis --batch also behave the same.

Looks like what's going on is, when an absolute path is passed
as a parameter, it feeds thru git ls-files, producing a relative file.
But with --batch, it stays absolute. This causes things that try to eg,
look up the file in the tree to not find it.

So, --batch needs to make filepaths relative too..
