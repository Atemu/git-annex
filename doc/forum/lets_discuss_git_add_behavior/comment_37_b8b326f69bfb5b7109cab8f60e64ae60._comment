I am a big big fan of Joey and a big big fan of git annex, been using this for 7+ years. I absolutely love the reasoning that Joey does and how we identifies the best way to solve any problem.

But this is the first change that does what I consider to be a major mistake. It's essentially had me rethinking whether I can trust git annex anymore, and am tempted to continue using older versions which come with their own problems. It essentially all comes down to \"sane defaults\". Joey's reasonings are absolutely bang on, but optimizing for a very specific use case and silently doing things behind the scenes does not make sense.

For instance, git lfs does not add all files to lfs silently, but this essentially makes git annex do that in a sense.

My understanding is that this has been changed to some extent in recent versions, but I'm not 100% sure what the state is. In any case, I propose something like this

* Sane default -> git add ALWAYS adds files to git, git annex add ALWAYS add files to git annex, no exceptions
* Permit configuring which files get added to annex by git add, or to git by git annex add.
  Honestly, it's becoming super confusing how all the different options like largefiles interact with each other. For this purpose, I suggest having a new namespace/version of configs that cleans this up, to maybe something like.

~~~
cat .gitaddtoannex
*.ogg
*.mp3
> 100MB

cat .gitannexaddtogit
.*
< 3MB
~~~

I feel this will simplify the part and making it super clear what will happen. Having the same behavior for `git mv` and `mv` can be handled as suggested already. Please let me know your thoughts on this, Joey.

Greatly appreciate all the work you are doing and hope we can continue to keep git annex the rock solid option it is. I think simplifying some of these configs will also help make it more accessible to less techie folks as well.
