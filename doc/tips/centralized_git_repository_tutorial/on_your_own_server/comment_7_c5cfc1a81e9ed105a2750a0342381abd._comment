I'm trying to following the instructions here, but keep running into the following problem whenever I try to clone the remote repo:
```
0$ git clone ssh://remote.example.com/~/tmp/archive/git
Cloning into 'git'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
0$ cd git/
0$ git annex init local
init servo (scanning for unlocked files...)

  Unable to parse git config from origin

  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore

  This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git annex enableremote origin
ok
(recording state in git...)
0$ 
```
What am I doing wrong?  The remote repo is setup bare, exactly as suggested.
