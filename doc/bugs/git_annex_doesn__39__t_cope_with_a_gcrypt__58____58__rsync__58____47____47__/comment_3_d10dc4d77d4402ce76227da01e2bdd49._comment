Some users there report that git-annex sync does work, as far as running
git push and pull. I think the form of your url is the problem,
gcrypt::rsync://192.168.178.241:test seems like it's trying to mix url
and rsync location syntax. Urls don't normally end with ":test",
that's not a valid url, and so the parse fails.
(Verified using Network.URI.parseURI same as git-annex does.)

Something like
gcrypt::rsync://192.168.178.241/home/you/test will work, or at least not
crash at that point.
