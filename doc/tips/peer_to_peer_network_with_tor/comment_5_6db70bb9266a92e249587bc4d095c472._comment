I have updated the instructions to note two extra dependencies, the combination of which break this setup process out of the box on openSUSE.  I've filed [a bug with openSUSE](https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1152403) to improve their python-magic-wormhole package.  Hopefully I can work with the package maintainers to make this a non-issue.
