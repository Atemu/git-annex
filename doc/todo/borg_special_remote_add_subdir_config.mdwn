Sometimes a borg backup contains several git-annex repos. Then pointing
git-annex at the whole thing will find objects not belonging to the current
repo. To avoid this, add this option:

* `subdir` - A subdirectory within the borg repository where git-annex
  should look for annex object files. This can be the path to a git-annex
  repository or perhaps a non-encrypted special remote, or a path that
  contains several repositories. The default is to look through the
  whole repository.

  This is useful to avoid finding object files in the borg repository
  that belong to unrelated git-annex repositories.
