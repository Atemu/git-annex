Currently the git-lfs special remote needs a ssh url to the server,
because it only supports authentication over ssh. To support a http url,
it needs to do http basic authentication (easy enough) using a username
and password that it prompts the user for, ideally the same way git would
when accessing that repository over http.

`git credential` provides a way to reuse git's authentication system,
and would be more appropriate to use here than git-annex's own creds
system for special remotes. --[[Joey]]
