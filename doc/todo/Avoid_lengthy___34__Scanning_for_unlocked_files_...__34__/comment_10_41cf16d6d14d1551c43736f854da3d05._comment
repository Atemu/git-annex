\"annex.supportunlocked=false does prevent installing smudge/clean filters\" -- then, do I understand correctly that, if it were a `git-annex-config` setting and `annex.supportunlocked=false` implied `annex.gitaddtoannex=false`, this would prevent inadvertently adding unlocked files?  Then, assuming \"typical\" repo usage, it would also prevent inadvertently merging unlocked files, since you'd
have to add them first.
