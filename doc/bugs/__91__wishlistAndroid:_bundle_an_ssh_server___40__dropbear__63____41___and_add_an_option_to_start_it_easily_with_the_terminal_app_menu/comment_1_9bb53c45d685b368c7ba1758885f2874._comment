This was previously suggested in the forum: [[forum/Suggestion:_Put_ssh_server_back_into_android_version]]

As said there, I feel that `adb` is a better option in these situations. Of course, the git-annex bundle already has a ssh client, so you can rsync files from it to other ssh servers too.

Also, the bundle is too big, I don't want to make it any bigger.
