First of all I just want to say that I'm really impressed by git-annex. I was
looking for such a tool for a long time and I'm really happy that I finally
found it. It really does the trick for me to handle all my data.

My problem is now that I wanted to push some changes to doc/, this page says
that it shouldn't be a problem even without authentication. But I get following
error:

```

To git://git-annex.branchable.com/
 ! [remote rejected]     master -> master (failed to update ref)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git://git-annex.branchable.com/'
```

Seems to me that I'm not permitted, or am I doing something wrong? Or is the
information on this page not up-to-date anymore?
