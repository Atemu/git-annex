On macOS High Sierra (10.13.3) trying to use git-annex from the latest .dmg shows the following error:

    > git annex version
    dyld: Symbol not found: _inflateValidate
      Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/libPng.dylib
      Expected in: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/B
     in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/libPng.dylib
    error: git-annex died of signal 6

I ran it by opening the .app directory (Show Package Contents) and running the `runshell` script to set up the environment:

    > which git
    /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/git
    > which git-annex
    /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bundle/git-annex
