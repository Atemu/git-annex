The Remote interface recently got importKey, which gets us
unexpectedly a *lot* closer to making `git-annex import --from borg` a reality!

The Remote would need a listImportableContents that finds all annex objects
in all (new) snapshots, and generates a ContentIdentifier that is just the
snapshot plus object path. Then importKey can simply generate a Key from
that ContentIdentifier without doing any more work. (And, so getting an
object from the remote will also work, because it will have the
ContentIdentifier recorded and so will know what snapshot and path in the
borg repo.) 

Seems that all that would be needed is a way to skip generating the git tree
for the imported files, since it would be useless.
And a way to force --no-content, since importing from a borg backup should not
get all the backed up annex objects. It may be best to make this a new
command, that just happens to use the ImportActions interface.
