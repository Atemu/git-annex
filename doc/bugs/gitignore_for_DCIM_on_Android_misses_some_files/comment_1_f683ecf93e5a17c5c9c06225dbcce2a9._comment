\".thumbnails/*\" in .gitignore makes git ignore dotfiles in the directory in my testing, and according to git's own documentation.

However, it is the case that subdir/.thumbnails/* are not ignored by \".thumbnails/*\", but \".thumbnails\" will indeed ignore .thumbnails directories at any point in the tree. So, I've made the change you suggested.

(I also tested on android, with 1.8.4.1.559 and the assistant was able to honor the .gitignore, and did not add any files from `.thumbnails/`.)
