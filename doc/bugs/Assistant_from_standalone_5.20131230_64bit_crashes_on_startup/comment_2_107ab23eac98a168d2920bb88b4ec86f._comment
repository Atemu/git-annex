I've verified that git-annex runs the web browser in a cleaned up environment, that does not, for example, have the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` used by the bundle set.

I checked this by making a ~/dumpenv script:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
#!/bin/sh
set
echo \"$@\"
\"\"\"]]

Then `chmod +x ~/dumpenv; git config web.browser ~/dumpenv` and `git annex webapp` to run it.

I did notice that it set `GCONV_PATH=''`, rather than unsetting that variable, and have made a commit fixing that. But I doubt that caused this problem. 

The \"g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0\" seems to be a Mozilla bug: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=672671>, and does not seem to be related, probably firefox is printing that well before crashing.

It looks like libc can somehow demand-load libgcc_s.so, so I have force included that into the bundle. Don't know if that will help. Will be available in autobuilds in an hour.
