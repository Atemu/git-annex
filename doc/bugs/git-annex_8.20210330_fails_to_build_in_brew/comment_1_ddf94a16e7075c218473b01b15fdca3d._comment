A quick fix is to pin the haskell library persistent to a version older
than 2.12.0.1, which is the new version that broke the build. An easy way
to do that is to build using stack, which automatically pins all library
dependencies to known-working versions. By building with cabal you
choose to help me learn about new breakage the hard way, which is
appreciated if it is your intent. ;)

I've fixed this in master.
