oh, I agree that upgrading is sensible, but I don't actually control the server. Also, I don't see anything in the changelog that indicates that this bug has been fixed. The bug database is out of action as well. A brief examination of the source didn't answer any questions either. Very annoying all around.

Just think of it as adding robustness in the face of a misbehaving server.
