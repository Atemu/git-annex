I was able to build git-annex on the work laptop with these steps:

1. Make sure xcode is up-to-date.
2. Download and install \"Command Line Tools (OS X Mavericks) for Xcode - Late October 2013\" from https://developer.apple.com/downloads/ after logging in as a developer.
3. Follow the \"brew\" instructions at http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/OSX/
