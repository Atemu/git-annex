Currently `git annex unused` assumes that all branches (including remote
tracking branches) and tags are "used" and finds only objects not used by
any of those refs.

That's a reasonable default, but in some cases, we don't care about
specific refs. Perhaps we don't consider remote tracking branches
important. Or perhaps we only want objects in HEAD to be considered used.

This could be handled by adding an option to specify a refspec when running
git-annex unused. Only matching refs would be checked. It's probably worth
making this be both a command-line option --used-refspec, as well as a
annex.used-refspec config setting.

git's refspec format is not quite right (since it specifies a local side
and a remote side for push/pull). But, it can be used as a point of
departure. Let's allow wildcards as it does, and use leading '+' to add a
ref, and '-' to remove. Let the user specify multiple such expressions,
separated by ':'.

	+refs/heads/*:-refs/remotes/*:+refs/tags/*:-refs/tags/old-tag

Note that this needs to be processed by taking all refs matching any '+',
and then removing any of those that match any '-'

Also, allow use of HEAD, and anything else that `git show-ref` can handle.
