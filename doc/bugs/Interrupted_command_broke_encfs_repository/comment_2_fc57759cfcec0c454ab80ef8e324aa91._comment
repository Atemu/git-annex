The filesystem I use is ext4. I don't think the ext4 module of the linux kernel
present on my version of Android would be much different of the one on my
computer.

Therefore I guess I shall investigate in encfs. It is a pity there is no
alternative allowing to keep a directory encrypted without requiring
administrative privileges.

Thank you again.
