What is being optimised here? A single external special remote process
is already used for multiple operations, and the overhead is only
in the necessary context switches between processes and pipe IO.

Note that git-annex -J will start up several external special remote
processes and distribute jobs between them. The way git-annex processes
files, it never builds up a big list of queries to make later; each query or
other operation needs to be completed before it knows what the next
operation will be for a given key. So it seems hard to see how it could
use something like this if it were in the protocol.
