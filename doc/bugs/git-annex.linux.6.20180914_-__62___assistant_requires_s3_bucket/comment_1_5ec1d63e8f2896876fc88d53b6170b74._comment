It seems to me this must depend on the repository that you have the
assistant configured to run in. If that repository has a S3 remote set up
in the git config, but is somehow missing the bucket name configuration,
that would explain this error message.

Or, the S3 remote in question might have been configured with
autoenable=true, so git-annex tries to enabled it on a new clone?

So please show your repository's .git/config file, and also
the output of this command run in the repository:

`git show git-annex:remote.log | grep autoenable | cut -d" " -f1`
