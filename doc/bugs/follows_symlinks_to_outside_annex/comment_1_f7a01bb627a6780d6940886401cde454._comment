Tried to reproduce this, and so far no luck. I tried several symlinks to outside ~/annex, in both direct and indirect mode, and neither the assistant's startup scan nor its inotify handling followed the links and added the content of the directory symlinked to. 

I wonder if [[bugs/Symlinks_from_git-annex_repository_to_outside_git_repository_not_supported]] is the same problem. That seems to suggest this happens when merging the symlink into another repository. I am not clear on the details of how to reproduce it yet.
