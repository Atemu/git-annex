This comes down to this part of preferredRequiredMapsLoad:

	pc <- genmap preferredContentLog =<< groupPreferredContentMapRaw
	rc <- genmap requiredContentLog M.empty

So for required content, it does not use the group preferred content map.

Should it also use the groupwanted values for required content in this case?
It kind of makes sense, but I do wonder if someone might have a group that they
want to use one expression for its preferred content (groupwanted)
and a different expression for its required content ("grouprequired").

OTOH, I suppose that allowing for the former case now does not prevent
later adding support for the latter. 

(Also, setting required to "standard" already works, so that's a precident.)

Confirmed that passing the map does fix the behavior, so I'm doing that.
