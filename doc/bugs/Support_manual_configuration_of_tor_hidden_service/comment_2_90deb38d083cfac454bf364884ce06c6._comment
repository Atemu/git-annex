The port can be any otherwise unused port of the system.

The service's unix socket file has to have a name that ends
with the uuid of the git-annex repository that's going to use it,
because git-annex parses torrc to find that.

And git-annex has to know what the port and onion address are
to construct the base p2p address ("tor-annex:$onionaddr:$port").
That gets stored in `.git/annex/p2paddrs`.

Otherwise, you can use more or less whatever tor configuration you want to.
