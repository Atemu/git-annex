@Ilya_Shlyakhter the way export tree remotes work is git-annex keeps track
of the tree object that corresponds to the state of the remote, as well
as the usual presense tracking information. It uses the presense tracking
to know which files in the tree have reached the remote, and the tree to
work out the path to a file on the remote.

So the only way to manipulate its tracking for those is to update the tree
that it has recorded as exported there, as well as the presence information
this command is about. [[internals]] has the details for the export.log.
