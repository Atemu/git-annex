### Please describe the problem.
Using `git annex find --batch` with matching options seems to not apply them.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    find -type l | git annex find --batch --copies 2
    ... list of files that include files with only 1 copy ...

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
I'd rather not say ~~because it is ancient~~. Joey says this is reproducible on recent git-annex versions though.
