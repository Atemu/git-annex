Generally, command-line options should override other configuration,
so --only-annex seems like it should enable content syncing even if
annex.synccontent=false were a documented setting, the same as --content
should.

I think a case could be made for annex.synccontent=false +
annex.synconlyannex=true not syncing content.

I do wonder though if that's the best approach. It kind of seems like what
you really want is a way to configure a default preferred content
expression for clones that do not have a specific one configured. And
that seems more broadly useful than fine-tuning the interaction of two
git-annex sync configurations.
