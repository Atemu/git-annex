Ok, so importfeed looks for items in a feed with enclosures, but this feed is not a podcast feed. So it needs to look for some of the `<links>`
to find pages that quvi supports. (There might be other links that are not video pages, for all I know. Looks like `getItemLink` finds the right links and then I just need to filter through quvi.
