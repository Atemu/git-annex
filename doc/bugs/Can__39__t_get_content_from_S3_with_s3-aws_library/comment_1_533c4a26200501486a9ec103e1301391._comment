So the http 301 redirect seems to be the relevant clue.

Perhaps the old S3 library followed such redirects and the new aws library
does not. Although AFAICS, http-client should follow redirects by default.

Are you able to store new files in this remote and get them back out?

Which Amazon datacenter is the bucket at?

I've added some more debugging to the S3 remote; --debug will now
have it log the http requests and responses. Perhaps this will give us
more clues to the problem.
