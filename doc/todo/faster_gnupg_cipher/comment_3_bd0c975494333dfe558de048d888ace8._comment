AES-NI acceleration will be used by default providing you're using
the new modularized GnuPG (v2.x) and libgcrypt â‰¥ 1.5.0. Of course it
only speeds up AES encryption, while GnuPG uses CAST by default; you can
either set `personal-cipher-preferences` to AES or AES256 in your
`gpg.conf` or, as joeyh hinted at, set `remote.<name>.annex-gnupg-options`
as described in the manpage.

By the way, I observed a significant speed up when using `--compress-algo none`.
Image, music and video files are typically hard to compress further, and it seems
that's where gpg spent most of its time, at least on the few files I benchmarked.
