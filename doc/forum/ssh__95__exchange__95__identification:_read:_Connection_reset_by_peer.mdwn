I setup a local git annex repo and tried to pair it with an empty repo on my notebook. All done via the webapp.

But pairing failed somehow, because I get this error while transfer seems to go on forever.

    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

The webapp shows the remote repo as "unfinished repository".

I can access the other computer via ssh and an other git-annex repo pairing between the two computers work fine.

juh
