This is the same as concurrent `git add` (with or without git-annex)
failing due to git only allowing one writer to the index at a time.

Since this is a fundamental limitation of git, I feel that git-annex should
not try to work around it for things involving the worktree's index file,
except for within the same command as it does for `git annex add -J`.

`git annex fromkey` obviously does need to update the worktree's index
file. I suggest you run it in --batch mode and serialize the changes to it
that way.

(git-annex does of course work around the problem for the git-annex branch's index
file, but that's very different than the worktree index; it doesn't matter if
one process stages and commits another process's git-annex branch changes).
