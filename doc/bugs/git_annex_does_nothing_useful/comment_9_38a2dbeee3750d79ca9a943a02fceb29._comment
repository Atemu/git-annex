Can you run the series of commands I had above on your two machines?  I figure there are two possibilities:

1. There is something wrong with the git-annex versions you are using.
2. There is something wrong with your repository. (\"warning: There are too many unreachable loose objects\"?)

so if you can make a temp repository on goldnerlab, then clone it on the other machine and see where it fails, that would be helpful.
 
after cloning git-annex status should hopefully say that you have 1 known key, not 0.

Obviously this won't fix the problem, but it will at least narrow it down.
