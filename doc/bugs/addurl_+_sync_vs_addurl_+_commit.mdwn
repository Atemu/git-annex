### Please describe the problem.

I think this is what happened; I need to go back and check this again (maybe I was just misreading something) but IÂ want to get it written down first.

I've got a git repository, and I just ran git annex init. Then I ran git annex addurl a bunch of times, followed by git annex sync. The result was apparently a repository where the files downloaded by addurl were added using the SHA256 backend rather than the URL backend. I deleted the branches and tried again, but this time after calling git annex addurl a bunch of times I did a normal git commit. This time everything looked fine; the files were all listed in as present in the web remote.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git annex init
git annex addurl https://archive.org/download/emularity_engine_jsmess/messnapple2e.js.gz --file messnapple2e.js.gz
git annex sync
