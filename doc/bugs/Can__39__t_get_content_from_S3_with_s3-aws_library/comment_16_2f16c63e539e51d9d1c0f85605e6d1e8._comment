Investigating further, when I create a bucket with the AWS library
in ap-southeast-2, `s3cmd info` shows it is located there.

When I create a bucket with hS3 in ap-southeast-2, I get this
interesting output:

	joey@darkstar:~>s3cmd info s3://s3-43302240-076c-4420-8099-f2ef0b517e5f
	s3://s3-43302240-076c-4420-8099-f2ef0b517e5f/ (bucket):
	   Location:  ap-southeast-2
	WARNING: Redirected to: s3-43302240-076c-4420-8099-f2ef0b517e5f.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com
	   Expiration Rule: none
	   policy: none
	   ACL:       joeyhess: FULL_CONTROL

So, it's apparently in the datacenter I asked for when making it,
but here's a redirect again.
