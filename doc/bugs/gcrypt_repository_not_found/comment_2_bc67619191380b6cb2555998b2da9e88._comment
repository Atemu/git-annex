I understand, thanks for the analysis!

As it turns out, the problem was that I had this block in my `~/.gitconfig`:

    [push]
        gpgSign = if-asked

This means that git-annex is not the component that was passing the
argument. That's why I couldn't find it anywhere in the source. git
itself was passing this along.

I would then make the argument that git-remote-gcrypt is the one that
should be more tolerant to those arguments. Should I send a pull
request for this?
