\"docker is too insecure to auto-install, enable and execute random special-remote programs\" -- interesting, didn't realize that.   Maybe prompt the user for permission, and/or tell them to set a git config setting to enable auto-install?

In practice people often end up running less-than-vetted code, e.g. when trying out python packages written by people they don't know.  Running sandboxed code seems relatively safe next to that.
