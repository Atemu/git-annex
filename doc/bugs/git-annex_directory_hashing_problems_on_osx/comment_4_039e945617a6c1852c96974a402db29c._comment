In my \"sources\" repo on x00, the current setting is this \"ignorecase = true\" it was the first repo that I created before I clone it elsewhere and pull my changes back, it is on a HFS+ partition which is case insensitive and it is replicated on a portable hdd with a bare repo on a exfat partition. I wonder if my portable disk has a partially borked repo :P
