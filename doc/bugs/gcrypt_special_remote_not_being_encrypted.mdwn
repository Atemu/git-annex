### Please describe the problem.
I'm trying to setup a ssh special remote with gcrypt as an always-on sync point for 2 other machines. However, when syncing, only the first machine that was setup seems to do the encryption properly, the other machine that clones from the gcrypt remote sync the file content without encryption. I followed the instruction on https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt/

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

On the first machine:

```
cd MyStuffs
git init
git annex init "Macbook"
cat "First file" > first.txt
git annex add .
git commit -a -m added
git annex initremote personal-server type=gcrypt gitrepo=ssh://user@foo.bar.com/home/user/MyStuffs keyid=XXXXXXXXX
git annex sync 
git annex sync--content
```

On second machine

```
git clone gcrypt::ssh://user@foo.bar.com/home/user/MyStuffs test
git annex enableremote personal-server gitrepo=ssh://user@foo.bar.com/home/user/MyStuffs 
cd test 
cat "BananaTest" > test
git annex add .
git commit -a -m added
git annex sync --content
```

On the remote server

```
cd ~/MyStuffs
grep -r "First" . #There is no result, which is good
grep -r "Banana" . #On the other hand, this has a result
> ./annex/objects/ee1/042/SHA256E-s5--11861eaa2e70e8ac73d9d20cd172b6a5396cb0116fed5bfe432ca075144b2d48.org/SHA256E-s5--11861eaa2e70e8ac73d9d20cd172b6a5396cb0116fed5bfe432ca075144b2d48.org:BananaTest

```
If the first machine do `git annex sync --content`, it can get and view the new file normally, trying to add new file afterward from the first machine works fine as well. Adding file from the 2nd machine results in the same behaviour (unencrypted file content). 

When using gcrypt special remote on local machine , it does not seem to be an issue.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

The first and second machine was in fact the same machine ,running OS X El Capitan

```

The remote server that use ssh is Debian Jessie, without git-annex installed (I tried it with git-annex installed on the server, it has the same behaviour)

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, everything works very nicely except this issue.
