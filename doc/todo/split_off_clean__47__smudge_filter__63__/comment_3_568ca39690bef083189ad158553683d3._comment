What is your evidence that the size of the git-annex
executable has anything to do with that?

I hope you're aware that linux does not load entire programs into memory
before running them. It mmaps them and loads pages on demand. (I assume
most other modern OS's do similar things.)

It's easy to build a significantly smaller git-annex, just disable
the assistant build flag, and you should get a binary around 30mb rather
than 60mb. I'll wager you do not find any statistically significant
differences in the performance of such a build of git-annex with one
containing the assistant.
