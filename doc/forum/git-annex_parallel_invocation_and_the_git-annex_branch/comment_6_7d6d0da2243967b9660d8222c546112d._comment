During parallel running of git-annex commands, I also get errors like

git-annex: .git/annex/othertmp/inge59014-3: getFileStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)
failed

git-annex: .git/annex/othertmp/ingest-assemble_den59014-8: removeLink: does not exist (No such file or directory)
failed

Is this also now fixed by [[todo/only_allow_one_git_queue_to_be_flushed_at_a_time]], or is it a separate issue?

Also, is it correct that linked worktrees must be on the same filesystem as the main worktree, when using git-annex, because the linked worktrees must be on the same filesystem as .git/annex/othertmp ?
