## symlinks

Apparently new versions of Windows have something very like symlinks.
(Or really, 3 or so things not entirely unlike symlinks and all different.)
Stackoverflow has some details.

Make git use them, as it (apparently) does not yet.

Currently, on Windows, git checks out symlinks as files containing the symlink
target as their contents.

## POSIX

Lots of ifdefs and pain to deal with POSIX calls in the code base.

Or I could try to use Cywin.
