### Please describe the problem.

In a repository with submodules, if I want to initialise git-annex on all submodules, I expect that `git submodule foreach git annex init` should work.  Other `git-annex` commands seem to work with the `submodule foreach` command just fine.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

 1. Clone a repository with submodules (recursively): `git clone --recursive <remote>`
 2. Initialise the main repository's annex: `git annex init`
 3. Try to initialise git-annex in all submodules: `git submodule foreach git annex init`

This produces the following error:
```
git-annex: git: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: chdir: inappropriate type (Not a directory)
fatal: run_command returned non-zero status for scripts
.
```

As a workaround, manually changing directory into each submodule and running `git annex init` works, but there are cases where having a general script that can iterate submodules is convenient.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

- git-annex version: 8.20201007-gcf33be21ac
- OS: Arch Linux


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I use it regularly with great success :)
