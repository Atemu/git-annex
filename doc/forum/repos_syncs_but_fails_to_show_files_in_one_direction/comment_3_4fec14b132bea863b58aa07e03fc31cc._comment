Thanks Joey,
after your comment, I decided to migrate the repo's contents to a new one in v6 format. However, I run into several other issues. I wished there was a live support that I can pay with coffee or beer... :-) Instead, I try to figure around the issues by myself, hopefully not spamming too much here into this forum. :-(

BTW, thank you so much for the effort you have put into git-annex!
