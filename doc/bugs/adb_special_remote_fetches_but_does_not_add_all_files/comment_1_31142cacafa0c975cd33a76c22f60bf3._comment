"Failed to import some files from remotename. Re-run command to resume import."

AFAICS if it displayed that, it would not go on to add *any* files
to the remote's tracking branch. Only when it's been able to import all
the files it found on the remote does a commit get made.

I have seen the adb pull of a file fail once or twice (out of several
hundred imports so far), and adb did display an error message, and I
assume git-annex also then said the import of that file failed.

The other way it could fail to download a file is if the content seems to
have changed since file list for the import was built. In that case,
there would be no error message, just "import foo failed" rather than 
"import foo ok"

Can you paste a transcript of the problem?
