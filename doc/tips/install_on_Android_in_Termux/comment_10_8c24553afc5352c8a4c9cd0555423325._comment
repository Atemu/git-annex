Setting all the environment variables from inside still did not break the tar execution; last resort was disabling proot in runshell. I still had to keep the termux-fix-shebang workaround.

    $ ./git-annex.linux/runshell
    $ mkdir test; cd test
    $ git init
    $ git annex init

From a first glance, things appear to be working now. I had to run termux-fix-shebang on the `.git/hooks/*` and set TMPDIR=something-that-actually-exists, but short of that, local adding and committing as well as moving data around.

Joey, you mentioned ghc runtime issues when introducing proot. Anything particular I should test?
