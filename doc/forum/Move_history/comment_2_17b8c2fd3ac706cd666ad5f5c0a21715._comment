>  If you run git annex info you can see how much of this space is from actual annexed objects local annex size

I don't understand what you mean, `git annex info` tells me nothing about the repository size, and I have no idea where to enter the “local annex size” string.
At any rate, no, I have already run `git annex dropunused` to get rid of all unused files. All the rest seems to be needed for some reason. My question was whether I can move all of this history to one of my volumes which have more space on them.
