I think it's possible to write such an external special remote.
You would need to generate the hashes that git-lfs uses
to store files and have git-annex remember them for retrieval, using
SETSTATE and GETSTATE.

(IIRC git-lfs uses SHA256, so when a git-annex key also does, which is
common, you could special case it to avoid needing to store state.)
