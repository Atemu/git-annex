`git-annex import master --from android` should have created an
android/master branch with the imported files in it. There is apparently no
such branch in your case.

But I see that you also posted [[forum/--verbose_not_really_verbose__63__]]
where you talk about having interrupted the import before it was complete.
Since the branch only gets created when the import is allowed to finish, I
think that explains your problem.

It's rarely a good idea to not fully explain what you actually did when
reporting what seems like a problem. If I had not happened to read that
forum post first, and noticed it was also from you, we would have embarked
on a snipe hunt to find some bug that doesn't really exist.
