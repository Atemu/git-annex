git-annex import --no-content means annex.largefiles is not checked, so
non-large files get added as annexed files. That's done because
annex.largefiles can contain expressions that need to examine the content
of the file. In particular for mimetype and mimeencoding.

So, if someone uses import --no-content in one repo, and in another clone
it's used with --content, importing the same files both times, a merge
conflict can result.

May be worth removing support for matching annex.largefiles when the
expression needs the file content, when importing from a special remote.

Or could detect when those are used, and only allow 
importing with --content in that case.

Which is better? The repo may have annex.largefiles set in gitattributes
for good workflow reasons, so it would be very annoying to have importing
error out. And if importing ignores the configuration, the user is likely
to see that as a bug. If importing with --no-content looks at the config
and say "sorry, I can't, need the file content", the user can then choose
between changing largefiles or using --content, and it's clear how they're
asking for contradictory things.
