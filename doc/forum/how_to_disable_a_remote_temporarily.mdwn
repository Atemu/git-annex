In our quest to find dumb replacements for [[todo/wishlist: 'get' queue and schedule.]] (and a more complete [[git-annex-schedule]], we have setup a cronjob that would start and stop the assistant during certain time windows, to ensure that it would not download during prime bandwidth time.

But that isn't exactly what we're looking for: we would like the assistant to continue doing its usual thing of adding and removing files, and even syncing the git branches. Just not get/move files around.

One way I thought of doing this was to disable a remote locally. [[git-annex-dead]] of course comes to mind, but that applies to all repositories, so it's not an option. If the remote was in git, i could just `git remote rm origin` and `git remote add origin` and be done with it, but this is the *web* remote, so it doesn't even show up in `git remote -v`.

So how do i disable a [[special remotes]]?
