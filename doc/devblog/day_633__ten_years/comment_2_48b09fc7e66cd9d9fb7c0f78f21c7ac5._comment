\"Thanks\" doesn't quite cut it, but still worth saying :)  Thanks for the huge amount of work and thought you've put into this over the years.  git-annex has grown into an impressive \"swiss army knife\" adaptable to all sorts of uses.  It's certainly one of the most best FLOSS projects I've seen.  With the proliferation of various cloud services for storing data, it's becoming even more useful for keeping track of things without losing sanity.  Thanks @joeyh!
