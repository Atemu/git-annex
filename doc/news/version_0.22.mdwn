git-annex 0.22 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Git annexes can now be attached to bare git repositories.
     (Both the local and remote host must have this version of git-annex
     installed for it to work.)
   * Support filenames that start with a dash; when such a file is passed
     to a utility it will be escaped to avoid it being interpreted as an
     option. (I went a little overboard and got the type checker involved
     in this, so such files are rather comprehensively supported now.)
   * New backends: SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224
     (Supported on systems where corresponding shaNsum commands are available.)
   * describe: New subcommand that can set or change the description of
     a repository.
   * Fix test suite to reap zombies.
     (Zombies can be particularly annoying on OSX; thanks to Jimmy Tang
     for his help eliminating the infestation... for now.)
   * Make test suite not rely on a working cp -pr.
     (The Unix wars are still ON!)
   * Look for dir.git directories the same as git does.
   * Support remote urls specified as relative paths.
   * Support non-ssh remote paths that contain tilde expansions.
   * fsck: Check for and repair location log damage.
   * Bugfix: When fsck detected and moved away corrupt file content, it did
     not update the location log."""]]
