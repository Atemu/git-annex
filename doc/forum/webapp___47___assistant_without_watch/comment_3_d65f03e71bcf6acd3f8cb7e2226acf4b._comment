I have just started using git annex. I just wanted to add that I would also like to use this. For me I would like the following features from the assistant but while i manually add / drop files:

* Automatic scheduling of consistency checking
* Intelligent automatic file syncing / unused dropping

But most of all a way of invoking the intelligent file syncing that the assistant uses from the command line, would a huge help.
