I used `s3cmd` with the same credentials and I'm able to list the bucket contents. That file does exist, and it does contain the line expected. If I try and make the bucket:

s3cmd mb s3://s3musicencrypted-a7e22956-5ce2-11e2-97a5-6f33220ffbf3
ERROR: S3 error: 409 (BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou): Your previous request to create the named bucket succeeded and you already own it.

So I should be able to create buckets, but of course creating a bucket that already exists doesn't really do anything.

Taking exactly the same credentials as my .s3cfg and using them with git annex continues to fail with signature errors.
