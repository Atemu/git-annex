It's impossible to guarantee a program will be able to get a particular port. Any other program could be using that port number.

This is why `git annex webapp` opens the webapp using whatever url the assistant has picked. I recommend that rather than using a pinned tab, you make an icon on your desktop that runs `git annex webapp`, and use that to open the app when you want it, much as you'd open any other app. If you wanted to, you could make your system run `git annex webapp` on startup instead of `git annex assistant --autostart`, and you'd get the browser tab opened automatically on start.
