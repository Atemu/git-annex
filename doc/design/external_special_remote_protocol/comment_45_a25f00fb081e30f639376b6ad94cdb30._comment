You never need to worry about cleaning up the files git-annex asks content
be downloaded to.

git-annex also has a per-key temporary work directory that could perhaps
be useful for this interface to expose; it manages cleanup of those
temporary directories at the right times.

You can detect when git-annex closes the external program's stdin, and perform
whatever shutdown cleanup you want to then. But of course there could be other
git-annex processes also running other instances of the same external
program, so you'd have to find a way to avoid deleting any files those are
using.
