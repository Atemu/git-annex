The instructions work with the current version of git-annex
installed on the server.

It's true that the original version of the tip suggested running git-annex
init in the repo on the server. I don't remember quite why; I thought
git-annex always supported remote auto-init.

I've changed this particular tutorial to work, but do note that 6 year old
versions of git-annex will have numerous bugs that have been fixed since
then, will be missing numerous features, are significantly slower, and that
in general this website does not and will not go out of its way to keep
documentation working for them.
