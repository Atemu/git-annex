I have the same issue like Horus described. Pairing fails in the LAN. 

\"illegal control characters in pairing message; ignoring\" appears in the log over and over

distributionUrl = \"https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.10_Yosemite/git-annex.dmg
distributionVersion = \"5.20150616\"
distributionReleasedate = 2015-06-17 18:18:52.552448 

Would be great to get help or a fix!
