Awesome, Thank you!  I [still](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/generic_readonly_http_remote/#comment-f6e076370814fcfab3a4d203a1adf326) think that it could be named more generically than `http` (e.g. probably could remap to public `rsync://`, `ftp://` or `s3://` to which git-annex knows how to \"talk to\") even if ATM supporting only `http/https`, but I guess time will show if that would be needed.
