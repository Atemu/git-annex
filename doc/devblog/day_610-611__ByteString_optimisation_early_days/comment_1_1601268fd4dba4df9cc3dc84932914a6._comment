66% performance improvements is an amazing number! i take it this will be especially good for repositories with a large number of files? if so this could make my life MUCH better! :)

i wonder if this connects with the [problems gorzen identified in python 3 about POSIX paths](https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10063-the-fundamental-problem-in-python-3)... does Haskell have similar problems with non-unicode filenames?

in any case, I thank you for this awesome work...
