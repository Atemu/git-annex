It would be wonderful if a pre-built package would be available for Synology NAS. Basically, this is an ARM-based Linux. It has most of the required shell commands either out of the box or easily available (through ipkg). But I think it would be difficult to install the Haskell compiler and all the required modules, so it would probably be better to cross-compile targeting ARM.
