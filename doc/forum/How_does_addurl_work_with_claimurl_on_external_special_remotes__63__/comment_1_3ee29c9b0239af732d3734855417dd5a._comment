CLAIMURL needs to be able to determine, by looking at the url alone, if
this is an url that the remote can claim.

Once a remote responds with CLAIMURL-SUCCESS, git-annex will register the
url, so GETURLS will work after that point. So in TRANSFER RETRIEVE
you can use GETURLS to check if there's a recorded url for the key,
and if the url is a google drive url that you recognise, you can download
it.
