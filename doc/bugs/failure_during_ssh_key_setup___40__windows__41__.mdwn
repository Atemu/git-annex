### Please describe the problem.
While attempting to create a remote repository, the assistant is trying to set up public key authentication, but fails when trying to delete the temporary files. Perhaps this doesn't need to be a fatal error; it could warn the user instead, or try again later.

DeleteFile "C:\\Users\\FAMILY~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\git-annex-keygen.1\\key.pub": permission denied (The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Create a remote repository

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Windows 7, git-annex version 5.20131221-gf8c928d
