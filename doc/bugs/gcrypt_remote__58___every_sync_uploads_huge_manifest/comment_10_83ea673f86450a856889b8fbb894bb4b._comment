Actually, it supports rsync urls already. But git-annex treats the url as
literally the rsync protocol, so it will run rsync with an url like
rsync://localhost/foo. Which will mostly fail unless there's actually a
rsync server running.
git-remote-gcrypt treats the same url as rsync over ssh.

See [[!commit 3e079cdcd1ac4f52ceb1c3ad483917d7c6133d0b]] for when that was
added in 2013. Although I'm doubtful if it actually worked; it seems like
initremote supported it, but it was never implemented the rest of
the way.

If anyone has been using that, it seems git-annex and git-remote-gcrypt
would be accessing the server in different ways, so the same server must
support rsync over ssh too, or git pushes to the remote would fail. So, it
seems all that's needed is for git-annex to treat that url as rsync over
ssh, and finish the incomplete implementation of rsync urls.

Ok, done!
