git-annex 3.20120105 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Added annex-web-options configuration settings, which can be
     used to provide parameters to whichever of wget or curl git-annex uses
     (depends on which is available, but most of their important options
     suitable for use here are the same).
   * Dotfiles, and files inside dotdirs are not added by "git annex add"
     unless the dotfile or directory is explicitly listed. So "git annex add ."
     will add all untracked files in the current directory except for those in
     dotdirs.
   * Added quickcheck to build dependencies, and fail if test suite cannot be
     built.
   * fsck: Do backend-specific check before checking numcopies is satisfied.
   * Run gpg with --no-tty. Closes: #[654721](http://bugs.debian.org/654721)"""]]
