Looking more closely at your list of files, your repository does not
contain a copy of the current version of demo_beheer.gpkg, which is
"SHA256E-s204800--a518c074bc22f673f0c73191a01426fef0a7d8b262a17d2729a4a3ac51da40ce.gpkg"

There's evidence you tried to download that key from somewhere, but the
download failed.

So, it seems that your repository is not in any unsual state, you're just
confused about how an unlocked file that is not present looks. Probably
commands like these will be useful:

	git annex get demo_beheer.gpkg
	git annex whereis demo_beheer.gpkg
