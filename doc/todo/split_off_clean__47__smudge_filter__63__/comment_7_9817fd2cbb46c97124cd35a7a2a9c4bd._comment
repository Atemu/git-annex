\"Each new invokation of git-annex has to re-open databases, start up git cat-file to query from, link the executable, read git config, etc. That takes a few hundred milliseconds.\" -- this is somewhat more of an issue now that all `git add/checkout` operations call the clean/smudge filter, even when there are no unlocked files.  One option is to [[only configure the filters for unlocked files|todo/only_pass_unlocked_files_through_the_clean__47__smudge_filter]] when only a few files are unlocked.
