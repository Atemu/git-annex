 The global git-annex installation was removed when I tried it with the standalone. So there was no possible interference.

I initiate the repo as described above. There is no local git-annex config as well as no remote. I do have a global `.gitconfig`, but besides the ordinary settings, there is nothing special:

```
[user]
	name =
	email = 
	signingKey = 
[core]
	editor = nvim
	excludesfile = /home/jeanclaude/.gitignore_global
[merge]
    tool = vimdiff
[mergetool]
    prompt = true
    keepBackup = false
[mergetool \"vimdiff\"]
    cmd = nvim -d $BASE $LOCAL $REMOTE $MERGED -c '$wincmd w' -c 'wincmd J'
[commit]
	gpgSign = true
[gpg]
	program = gpg2
[pull]
	ff = only
```

After adding my file, running `git annex whereis` and `git annex fsck` do indeed report was do indeed fail and report that there is no copy of my file.

```
$git annex whereis test.CR2
whereis test.CR2 (0 copies) failed
git-annex: whereis: 1 failed

# /tmp/test on git:master x  C:1
$git annex fsck
fsck test.CR2 
  ** No known copies exist of test.CR2
failed
(recording state in git...)
git-annex: fsck: 1 failed
```

I am running git version 2.29.2.

Git-annex does not have any \"global\" settings, caches or anything I could have overseen, right?
