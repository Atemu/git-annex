I don't know what the plans are exactly for the user-mode systemd.

It seems to me that, if it eventually becomes the session manager for the
desktop, then it will probably grow a generator to handle XDG autostart
.desktop files, and generate systemd services for them. Or, those XDG
autostart files will become deprecated, and programs will ship user-mode
service files.

In the first case, git-annex doesn't need to include a systemd file, and in
the second case it should. So best it seems to wait and see, or hear from
someone with more information.
