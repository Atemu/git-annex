Somehow git-annex has again lost a complete rsync remote with encryption enabled...

git-annex version was 3.20111111

> "once again" ? When did it do it before?

It's the second time i uploaded all the files to an encrypted rsync remote and git-annex is not able to find it anymore. --[[gebi]]

> "lost" ? How is the remote lost?

git-annex is not able to find any files on the encrypted rsync remote anymore.
Copy does not copy the content again but drop doesn't find it, thus it's somehow "lost" and in an strange state.
I've also had the state where the content was already on the remote side but git-annex copy would copy it again,
ignoring all the data on the remote side. --[[gebi]]

Both *remoteserver* and *localserver* are rsync remotes with enabled encryption.
All commands are executed on the git repository on my laptop.
Target of origin is a gitolite repository without annex support (thus the two rsync remotes).

Is there a way in git-annex to verify that all files fullfill the numcopies, in my case
numcopies=2, and can be read from the remotes their are on?
I thought that *copy* would verify that, but seems not.

The commands above are executed within a few seconds and completely repeatable. --[[gebi]]
