If the repository being accessed over globus uses .git/annex/objects/ 
locations, it sounds to me like it's a git-annex repo, being accessed over
a protocol other than ssh. A special remote that accesses remote annex
objects could be created, and --sameas used to make the special remote have
the same uuid as the (remote) git-annex repo.
