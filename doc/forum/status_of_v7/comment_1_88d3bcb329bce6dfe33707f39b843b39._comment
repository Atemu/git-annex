The main blocker to v7 becoming the default is that its replacement for
direct mode, adjusted unlocked branches, is still a new feature that has
not gotten a great deal of testing and could have bugs. See 
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/v7_path_toward_default/>
(I don't consider it to still be beta level though; on balance the many well
known problems with direct mode are certianly worse.)

When v7 is used without any unlocked files, it is nearly identical to v5
indirect, and so is just as good. With that said, I'm not personally using
it yet on my repos, because it also doesn't add any new features either..

When v7 is used with unlocked files, it is still a relatively new feature
and could have bugs. That said, people do appear to be using it
increasingly widely, and the last bugs fixed in it were in December 2018.

Unlocked files are also affected by

although that has been worked around sufficiently well it still has some
slight negative consequences.
