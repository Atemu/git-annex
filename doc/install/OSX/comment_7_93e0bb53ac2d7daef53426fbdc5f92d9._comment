I tried running the git-annex.app on my Core Duo Macbook pro, and it does not run at all.  I get an error on my system.log

`Nov  3 12:13:26 Bret-Mac [0x0-0x15015].com.branchable.git-annex[155]: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell: line 52: /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/git-annex: Bad CPU type in executable

It works on my 64 bit machine, and this has become quite the problem for a while now, where people with newer macs dont compile back for a 32bit machine.  

Is there any hope for a pre-compiled binary that works on a 32 bit machine?
