+1 on this suggestion.

Not all NASs are created equal so SAMBA/NFS isn't always the most recent version, upgrades aren't always possible (yes, I'm looking at you Drobo!) so sometimes you just can't do what g-a needs to do (locks are my big problem).

This would be a great option to have, even with the downsides of losing a lot of the awesome-sauce of git-annex.
