Thks for pointing me to the \"git add v7\" very interesting thread. It explains everything.

I'm using git-annex version: 7.20190912 (the default in Ubuntu 19.10 packages).

Neither annex.gitaddtoannex nor annex.largefiles were set in my repo. In this version, I have to set annex.largefiles to \"nothing\" to get the expected behaviour, annex.gitaddtoannex true/false does not change anything. Of course, I verified this behaviour in a fresh new repo without any config change/hack.

But even if annex.gitaddtoannex does not change anything right now, I'll set it to false, in case later version of git-annex uses it.
