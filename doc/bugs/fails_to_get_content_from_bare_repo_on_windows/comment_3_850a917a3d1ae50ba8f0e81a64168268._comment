The bug I was seeing with the \r was a recent reversion caused by [[!commit 95ca3bb02215744f3dbcaebd48844e1909c577f3]]. So, not related to original bug report. (And fixed now!)

I can now reproduce the original bug, including seeing the description of the bare repo when it says it cannot get the file from it.
