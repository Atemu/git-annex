You can avoid this by not using a deduplicating backend; for example you can use the WORM backend.

However, the foot shooting actually occurs due to using drop --force, which is explicitly asking git-annex to be unsafe. If you want to be safe, simply don't use --force. If you want to safely delete a file, simply `git rm` it, and then `git annex unused` will come along and find content that can safely be removed.
