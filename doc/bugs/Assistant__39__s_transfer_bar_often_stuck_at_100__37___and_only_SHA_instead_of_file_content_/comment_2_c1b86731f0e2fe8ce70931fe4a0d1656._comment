stracing transferkeys after it got stuck, it was stuck until 
this completed:

	wait4(461218, [{WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0}], 0, NULL) = 461218

That pid was "git --git-dir=../annex2/.git --work-tree=../annex2
--literal-pathspecs --literal-pathspecs -c core.safecrlf=false update-index
-q --refresh -z --stdin", and it did have a git-annex smudge --clean that
seemed stuck for a while.

Then it proceeded doing this:

	rename("../annex2/.git/annexindex.0/index", "../annex2/.git/index") = 0

annex2 is the remote. That temp directory and the git update-index process
says restagePointerFile is what got stuck.

I managed to strace the stuck git-annex smudge --clean, and it's in a loop:

	rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, ~[RTMIN RT_1], [], 8) = 0
	rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
	rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, ~[RTMIN RT_1], [], 8) = 0

(Just before that loop, it seemed to be waiting for some
child processes, but I didn't catch which ones they were.)

After many iterations:

	rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, ~[RTMIN RT_1], [], 8) = 0
	rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
	munmap(0x7f4438549000, 41947136)        = 0
	munmap(0x7f443ad4a000, 41947136)        = 0
	exit_group(0)                           = ?
	+++ exited with 0 +++
