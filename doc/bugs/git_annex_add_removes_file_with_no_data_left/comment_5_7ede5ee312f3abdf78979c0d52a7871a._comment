Yes, the symlink was still broken. Or rather, `tar -tf filename.tar` didn't like the file.

The file's about 193 M bzipped. I'll be e-mailing you a link to an S3 copy with DojOsEf2 in the subject line of the email--once the upload finishes. :)

I'm not sure if this is relevant, but the file is a tar of an annex and another git repo. Perhaps that is influencing something (although I presume it shouldn't)?
