Let's say I have 2 client repos located in my laptop and desktop and a backup repo located in an external drive.<br>
I want the 2 client repos to only want content that is already present in the repo. So I set their preferred content like this: 

```git annex wanted . "present"```

And let's say the 2 client repos already contain the file **test.txt**.

When I modify **test.txt** in the laptop repo and run `git annex sync --content`, then go to the desktop repo and run `git annex sync`,<br>
the behavior I'm expecting is that test.txt in the desktop repo will be updated when sync is run since clients want content that is already present. 

However, what happens is that the file **test.txt** in the desktop repo is **dropped**.<br>
Is this the expected behavior when using `present` in the preferred content expression?

How can I have the modified content in a client repo automatically copied via `git annex sync --content` to another client repo when the preferred content for the client group is to only want content that is already present?
