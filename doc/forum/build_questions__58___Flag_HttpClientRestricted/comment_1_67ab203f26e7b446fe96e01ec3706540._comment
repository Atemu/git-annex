These flags avoid pulling in some new external dependencies, which might
not be available in a particular set of haskell packages
or might fail to build (probably not). Since git-annex vendors a copy of
those libraries, disabling them won't change the result. (But I'm going to
drop those vendored libraries from it eventually.)

The way the stack.yaml works is it pins every single dependency at a
particular known-working version. That's the only reason to use it rather
than cabal. Cabal is generally the easiest way to get a build with all the
bleeding edge versions.

I update the stack.yaml to more or less current versions periodically.
(Specifically the versions chosen in a particular LTS release, which can
be behind bleeding edge in some cases when there's breakage being sorted
out there.) But my past several tries with newer lts versions have failed
because the debian packages are too old to use them.
