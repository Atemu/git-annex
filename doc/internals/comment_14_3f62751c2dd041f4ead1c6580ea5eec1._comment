P.S. Re: hardlinking identical files -- git-annex [[keeps track of inodes|todo/inode_based_clean_filter_for_less_surprising_git_add]] where contents is stored, so deleting a file might make that info stale.  Also, dropping one key will drop another key's contents without updating [[location_tracking]] info.  And dropping then getting files would lead to two separate copies again.   So I wouldn't recommend that.
