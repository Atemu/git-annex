I just tried in the browser console, and see the same behaviour.

I also see that links work when not on the dashboard.

I disabled javasript (set javascript.enabled to false in about:config), and the links all work well (though dropdown menus don't work at all).


(I see after writing this you seem to have worked it out already)
