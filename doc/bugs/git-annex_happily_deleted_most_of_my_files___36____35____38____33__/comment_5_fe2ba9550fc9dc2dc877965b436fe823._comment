I am experiencing the same thing (and have experienced it 1.5 years ago as well, right before deciding to never again use git-annex). Enough info or not is it simply unacceptable for your software to do this and you should look into it as best you can. Try to repeat the steps which he described. I for one, am getting much the same results.
