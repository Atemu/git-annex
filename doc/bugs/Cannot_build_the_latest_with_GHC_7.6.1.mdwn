What steps will reproduce the problem?

cabal install git-annex

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I get this:

    Assistant/WebApp/Configurators/Local.hs:55:11:
    `fieldEnctype' is not a (visible) field of constructor `Field'

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
