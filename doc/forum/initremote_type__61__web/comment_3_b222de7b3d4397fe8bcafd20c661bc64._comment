There is not currently a way to access files that were stored in a rsync
special remote over http instead of rsync. That would need a new special
remote, distinct from the web special remote.

I suppose it's a reasonable request, since the rsync and directory special
remotes are already [[cross_compatible|tips/multiple_remotes_accessing_the_same_data_store]].
And it could probably also be used for anonymous access to webdav and S3
special remotes.

Anyway, the option that is available today, and works, is to mirror a git
repository to the web server (running `git update-server-info` first) 
and add a git remote with the http url.
