Hmm, the current version of certificate is 1.3.1, and I installed it without trouble just now. I don't know why cabal is installing a much older version there.

In any case, this is not a bug in git annex, but some problem with the library that a library it uses depends on. You can use the pre-built standalone binary until cabal sorts itself out, I suppose.
