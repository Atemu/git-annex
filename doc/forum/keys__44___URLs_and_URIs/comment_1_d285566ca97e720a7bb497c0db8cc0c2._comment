The main difference is that git-annex will not try to
download URIs itself, but will try to download URLs.

Also, `git annex whereis` displays any URIs
claimed by the remote, but not URLs unless
the remote reponds to WHEREIS by listing them.

URLs/URIs are not recorded with a particular remote
owning them, but CLAIMURL can be used for a remote to
claim ownership.

sums it up pretty well, I thought.
