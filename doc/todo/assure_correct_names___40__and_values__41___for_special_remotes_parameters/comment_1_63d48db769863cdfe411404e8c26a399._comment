There's a subtle backwards compatibility issue here: The stored config of a
special remote is used when enabling it, so if an older version of
git-annex is used to enable a remote, there might be a setting that it does
not know about, or a value it doesn't understand. If that caused it to fail
to enable the remote it wouldn't be possible to use it, at least w/o
changing/removing the config.

For example, autoenable=true did not used to be a config setting, but older
versions of git-annex can still use remotes that have that.

Another example is chunk=. While older versions of git-annex don't
understand that, and so won't use chunks when storing/retrieving, 
the newer git-annex falls back to getting the unchunked object.
So things stored by the old git-annex can be retrieved by the new,
but not vice-versa.

Another example is S3's storageclass=. Older git-annex doesn't understand
it, so uses the default storage class, but that behavior is interoperable
with the new behavior.

So the stored config of a remote should not be checked
everytime the remote is instantiated, but only the new settings passed
to initremote/enableremote. That will complicate the API, since currently
the old and new config are combined together by enableremote.
