Now git-annex can be used on Android!

See [[/Android]] for installation instructions and other details.

The way it works now is the [[Linux_standalone]] builds of git-annex are run
inside the Termux app. The old git-annex Android app,
is no longer being updated, details about it are at [[oldapp]].
