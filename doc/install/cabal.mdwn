As a haskell package, git-annex can be installed using cabal.

Start by installing the [Haskell Platform][]. In Debian, this is as
simple as:

    sudo apt-get install haskell-platform

 [Haskell Platform]: http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/

## minimal build

This builds git-annex without some features that require C libraries, that
can be harder to get installed. This is plenty to get started using it,
although it does not include the assistant or webapp.

	cabal update
	PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
	cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin -f"-assistant -webapp -webdav -pairing -xmpp -dns"

## full build

To build with all features enabled, including the assistant and webapp,
you will need to install several C libraries and their headers,
including libgnutls, libgsasl, libxml2, and zlib. Then run:

	cabal update
	PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
	cabal install c2hs --bindir=$HOME/bin
	cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin

## building from git checkout

But maybe you want something newer (or older). Then [[download]] the version
you want, and use cabal as follows inside its source tree:

	cabal update
	PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
	cabal install c2hs --bindir=$HOME/bin
	cabal install --only-dependencies
	cabal configure
	cabal build
	cabal install --bindir=$HOME/bin

## installing some binary dependencies

Some binary dependencies can be installed by hand. This saves compilation time because `cabal` will find those packages and use them as is:

    apt-get install libghc-mtl-dev libghc-missingh-dev libghc-hslogger-dev libghc-pcre-light-dev libghc-sha-dev libghc-regex-tdfa-dev libghc-dataenc-dev libghc-utf8-string-dev libghc-hs3-dev libghc-quickcheck2-dev libghc-monad-control-dev libghc-monadcatchio-transformers-dev libghc-unix-compat-dev libghc-dlist-dev libghc-uuid-dev libghc-json-dev libghc-aeson-dev libghc-ifelse-dev libghc-bloomfilter-dev libghc-edit-distance-dev libghc-extensible-exceptions-dev  libghc-stm-dev libghc-dbus-dev libghc-case-insensitive-dev libghc-http-types-dev libghc-blaze-builder-dev libghc-crypto-api-dev libghc-network-multicast-dev libghc-network-info-dev libghc-safesemaphore-dev libghc-network-protocol-xmpp-dev libghc-gnutls-dev libghc-async-dev libghc-http-dev libghc-feed-dev

Those may also be available at the right version if you are running sid or jessie:

    apt-get install libghc-yesod-dev libghc-yesod-static-dev libghc-yesod-default-dev libghc-warp-dev libghc-wai-dev libghc-wai-logger-dev libghc-hamlet-dev libghc-clientsession-dev libghc-dav-dev libghc-extensible-exceptions-dev libghc-hinotify-dev
