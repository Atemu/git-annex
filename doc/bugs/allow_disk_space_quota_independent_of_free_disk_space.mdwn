### Please describe the problem.
Feature Request. Instead of (or perhaps in addition to) setting `annex.diskreserve`, I'd like to be able to tell git-annex "use up to 2TB of disk space".

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
