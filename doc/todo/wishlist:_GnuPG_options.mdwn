[Maybe I should have extented [[wishlist:_simpler_gpg_usage/]], but I thought I'd make my own since it's perhaps too old.]

I second Justin and [[his idea|wishlist:_simpler_gpg_usage/#comment-e120f8ede0d4cffce17cbf84564211c1]] of having per-remote GnuPG options. I'd even go one step further, and propose the option in the <tt>.gitattributes</tt> file. Indeed by default GnuPG compresses the data before encryption, which doesn't make a lot of sense for git-annex (in my use-case at least); My work-around to save this waste of CPU cycles was to customize my <tt>gpg.conf</tt>, but it's somewhat dirty since I do want to use compression in general.

Here is how I envision the <tt>.git/config</tt>:
<pre>    <code>[annex]
        gnupg-options = --s2k-cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 8388608 --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo none
</code></pre>

And compression could be enabled on say, text files, with a suitable wildcard in the <tt>.gitattributes</tt> file.
<pre>    <code>*.txt annex.gnupg-options="--s2k-cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 8388608 --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo zlib"
</code></pre>

This is something I could probably hack on if you think it'd be a worthwhile option ;-)
