When I wrote that, I was thinking of something more like, you have a clone of your repository
on the server, and you run `git annex addurl` sshed into there. Then you
can just run `git annex get` (or move) on the client later to download all the queued
stuff.

But, you can in fact tag files and operate on them like you're thinking of.

	git annex metadata --tag later

	git annex get --metadata tag=later
