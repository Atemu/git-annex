I am recently facing some few errors with the SnapChat and I cannot connect with anyone with this. I have tried a lot to get this issue solved but failed. I have even reinstalled it as per the instruction, given in <https://supportphonenumberaustralia.com/snapchat-support-phone-number/>, but all was in vain. Can anyone suggest me any solution in this regards?
