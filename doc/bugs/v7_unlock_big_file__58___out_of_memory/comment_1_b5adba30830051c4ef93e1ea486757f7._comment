Yeah, so git status is OOMing, not git-annex. (And git commit OOMs too BTW.)

I think git is just naively trying to malloc enough memory for the
entire file even though it's configured to use the smudge/clean filter
and the actual data it needs to deal with is small.

I've mentioned this on the git mailing list, in message-id
`<20190122220714.GA6176@kitenet.net>`.
