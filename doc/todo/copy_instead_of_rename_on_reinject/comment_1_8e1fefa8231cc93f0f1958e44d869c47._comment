The first word of the git-annex-reinject man page is "moves", so 
I find it hard to believe users would be surprised that it does that.
(Also, "inject" suggests movement.)

I can't see this being anything but an option added to reinject, because
changing behavior to copying when it's been move *would* be surprising, and
could result in a lot of unwanted disk space being used or other problems
with some workflow that involves reinject.

I am doubtful that such an option is worth it given the way git-annex
reinject is usually used.

And if I were in your situation, which I have been, I'd just delete the symlinks
I moved by accident, check them back out in the other repository,
and then unannex the files and move them. Much easier than running reinject
with long paths into the other repository.
