This is two unrelated bugs.

The problem with git is apparently due to homebrew having changed,
`ls -l /Users/joey/homebrew/Cellar/git/2.23.0/libexec/git-core`
shows a bunch of symlinks to ../bin/git and a few other binaries; 
Makefile copies the symlinks into the bundle but does not install the
binaries they link to.

The build version being a little behind is not uncommon when the
autobuilder has not been keeping up for whatever reason. I generally don't
block releases on autobuilds if it's the fault of the autobuilder and not
a bug in git-annex's build process or test suite, and just ship the latest
available build.

The autobuilder has since caught up again, so the daily
build is current but still suffers from the other problem.
