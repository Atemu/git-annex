Ok, thanks for the fix. It seems the fix isn't too reliable with my repos, I get different numbers of  \"** No known copies of...\" in the various cloned repos that I have. After all the \"messing\" that I have done to my repos I think git-annex has gotten very confused. I will just leave things as they are and let git-annex slowly migrate over to the new format or re-clone from a linux source and see how things go. I will report back on this issue in abit after I use it more to see.
