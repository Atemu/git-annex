It seems like the problem is when using a direct-mode repository on both sides of the copy.

I can get and copy files to and from the USB stick when I'm dealing with my Linux-based (indirect mode) repository.

Could it be that git-annex isn't properly noticing that c:\annex is in direct mode, and so it should copy from c:\annex\readme.txt instead of c:\annex\.git\annex\objects\... ?
