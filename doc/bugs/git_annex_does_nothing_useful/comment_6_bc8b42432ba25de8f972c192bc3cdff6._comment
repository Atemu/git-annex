I can easily reproduce the issue as follows,

Everything looks good so far. I verify that alex/plot.py doesn't exist. Now let's try getting it,                                                         
                                                                                                                                                          
    $ git annex get alex/plot.py -d                                                                                                                       
    git [\"--git-dir=/home/ben/data/.git\",\"--work-tree=/home/ben/data\",\"ls-files\",\"--cached\",\"-z\",\"--\",\"alex/plot.py\"]                                     
                                                                                                                                                          
Uh oh. ls confirms that get was unsucessful.
