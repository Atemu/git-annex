What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version 3.20130107, OS X Mountain Lion. No MacPorts/homebrew/fink installed. gcc / git are installed.

Please provide any additional information below.

Maybe something to do with the drive name having spaces? "/Volumes/git-annex" worked fine.
