I was hoping that there is a possibility that git-annex recognizes the files I do not want on my notebook based on the rule I described and drops them as soon as their copy arrived at the USB disk automatically (e.g. with the next sync command), and never pulls them back unless explicitly stated (especially, `sync --content` should not transfer them back). What you are describing is basically a manual tagging and dropping of the images. Of course I could write a script to drop the jpegs, but this would be very slow for 100000 images, and I was hoping for some more automated way from within git-annex.
