   * Make bittorrent special remote work w/o btshowmetainfo installed
     when it was build with torrentparser.
     Thanks, Robert Sch√ºtz
   * When running youtube-dl to get a filename, pass --no-playlist.
   * Fix build without concurrent-output.
   * init: When a crippled filesystem causes an adjusted unlocked branch to
     be used, set repo version to 7, which it neglected to do before.
   * init: When on a crippled filesystem, and the git version is too old
     to use an adjusted unlocked branch, fall back to using direct mode.
   * info: When used with an exporttree remote, includes an "exportedtree"
     info, which is the tree last exported to the remote. During an export
     conflict, multiple values will be listed.
   * dropunused: When an unused object file has gotten modified, eg due to
     annex.thin being set, don't silently skip it, but display a warning
     and let --force drop it.
   * annex.cachecreds: New config to allow disabling of credentials caching
     for special remotes."""]]
