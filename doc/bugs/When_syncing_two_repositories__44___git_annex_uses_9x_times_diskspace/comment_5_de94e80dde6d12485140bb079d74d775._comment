Aha, so it's a direct mode repository and all this \"typechange\" stuff git outputs in such repositories is presumably the main culprit for log bloat. I have made it suppress that output.

Excessive repacking may also explain a lot of the CPU usage and slowness. What does this say?

`grep \"Auto packing the repository for optimum performance.\" .git/annex/*.log |wc -l`

It may make sense for the assistant to tune `gc.auto` to avoid repacks. You might try disabling repacking altogether and see if it helps: `git config gc.auto 0`
