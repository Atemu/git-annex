Alternate idea:

	git annex initremote foo type=directory directory=/foo encryption=shared
	git annex initremote --sameas=foo foo-rsync type=rsync rsyncurl=server:/foo

The second command would inherit the encryption etc fields from the foo remote,
and set up the foo-rsync remote with the same uuid as it.
And it would add additional fields to the remote.log:

	-uuid name=foo type=directory encryption=shared cipher=...
	+uuid name=foo type=directory encryption=shared cipher=... alt.foo-rsync.type=rsync alt.foo-rsync.rsyncurl=server:/foo

When enableremote foo-rsync is later run and fails to find a name=foo-rsync,
it can look for a remote with the "alt.foo-rsync.type" field, and generate a
RemoteConfig with type=rsync rsyncurl=server:/foo encryption=shared cipher=...
From there the enableremote would proceed as usual.
