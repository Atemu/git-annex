### The Archivist

Bob has many drives to archive his data, most of them kept offline, in a
safe place.

With git-annex, Bob has a single directory tree that includes all
his files, even if their content is being stored offline. He can
reorganize his files using that tree, committing new versions to git,
without worry about accidentially deleting anything. 

When Bob needs access to some files, git-annex can tell him which drive(s)
they're on, and easily make them available. Indeed, every drive knows what
is on every other drive.

Run in a cron job, git-annex adds new files to achival drives at night. It
also helps Bob keep track of intentional, and unintentional copies of
files, and logs information he can use to decide when it's time to duplicate
the content of old drives.
