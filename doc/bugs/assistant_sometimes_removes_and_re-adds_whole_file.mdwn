### Please describe the problem.

I have syncing set up between two peers via tor.  Sometimes when I change a (non-annexed) file in one peer, the other peer receives the change, but then within a second or two adds a commit which removes the entire file, and within another second another commit which adds it back.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

This is not 100% reproducible.  I haven't figured out any pattern yet as to when it happens or doesn't happen.

1. Set up a fresh repo
1. `echo '* annex.largefiles=nothing' >.gitattributes` and commit
1. Add another (text) file and commit
1. `scp` the repo to another machine
1. Run `enable-tor`, `remotedaemon`, and `p2p --pair` on both
1. Modify the text file
1. Observe that the remote peer ends up with three new commits on `master` rather than one; from oldest to newest:
    1. The commit received via tor from the source side
    2. A local commit removing the text file
    3. A local commit adding it back with identical contents

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

7.20190912-g05bc37910 on both openSUSE nodes (sender is Leap 15.0, receiver is Tumbleweed)

### Please provide any additional information below.
