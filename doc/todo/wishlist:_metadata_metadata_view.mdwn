Currently looking at the metadata and views.

One of the things I would like to do is have a view that shows files by metadata metadata.. for example, "when the file last had tags changed".

Something along the lines of

    $ git annex view metadata-tag-mtime=YYYYMMDD
    view  (searching...)
    
    Switched to branch 'views/metadata/tag/mtime/YYYYMMDD'
    ok
    
    $ ls
    20130816
    20130921
    20131015

This would allow me to review files that haven't had any tag changes applied for a while and thus, may need the tags updating.

I've done this in every tagging system I've used by (ab)using mtime, but that requires an additional step (of touching the file).
