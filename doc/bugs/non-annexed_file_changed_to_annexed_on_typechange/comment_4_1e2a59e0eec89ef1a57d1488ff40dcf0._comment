@arand: That's precisely the problem!  I think you'll find if you run those commands exactly, that's what you'll get.

It's got something to do with the git annex pre-commit hook that runs and checks for typechanges.

I shortened the output on the last command to be less verbose, but if the full output is needed, I'll add it.
