One of my reasons for using haskell was that it provides the possibility of
some parallell processing. Although since git-annex hits the filesystem
heavily and mostly runs other git commands, maybe not a whole lot.

Anyway, each git-annex command is broken down into a series of independant 
actions, which has some potential for parallelism.

Probably they would need to be split further. Each action currently has 3
distinct phases, basically "check", "do", and "record". If the check action
returned a do action that returned a record action, then it could easily
make sense to parallelize the check actions and start on the do actions
(which probably won't parallelize well) while they are still being
generated, and possibly parallelize the record actions at the end.
