Hey joey (and anyone else struggling to compile on OpenBSD)

Just thought I'd give you this update. Git annex now successfully builds for me on OpenBSD 6.3
I think a recent change regarding the building without assistant fixed it.
I was playing around with constraints to try to force my way around problematic hackage package versions and decided to start from scrap a couple of days later.
6.20180808 then simply worked for me. 

Please be aware that I built using cabal with the following flags, otherwise as per the instructions on the \"fromsource\" page here.
\"-s3 -webdav -assistant -webapp -pairing -torrentparser -magicmime -dbus\"

I don't know if you have intentionally worked on support for the BSDs or another fix applied here as well, but it works now. 
Thanks a lot, joey! I really appreciate this.
