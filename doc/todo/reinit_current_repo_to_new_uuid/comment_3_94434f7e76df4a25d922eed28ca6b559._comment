I don't want to complicate the location logs with time-dependent sameas
hacks.

Is this repo that's been copied a special remote? fsck --fast --from would
then not be very fast since it has to talk to the special remote. A
dedicated command could be faster than that.

If the repo is a git-annex repo though, I'd expect git annex fsck --fast 
to be nearly optimal, the only extra work it does over such a dedicated
command, I think, is a stat of the object file to check if it's present.
