Hi, i have the same problem. I can't compile from source but ive looked at the process and it seems that GIT_SSH/GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION are set ok. Ive also looked through the source even though my haskell is quite limited and eventually managed to get something working by bypassing the
<pre><code>g' <- addGitEnv g sshOptionsEnv val
addGitEnv g' \"GIT_SSH\" command</code></pre>
lines but i can't remember right now how i did it, though i remember it was by setting something similar to GIT_SSH (probably just it to 'c:\program...\git\bin\git.exe' or ssh.exe with a combination of GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION='').
It didn't show the 'git annex unknown command' stuff but it did mess up the repo (said it synced the annex/direct/master synced/* branches but the changed didn't appear on the remote/origin).
If there's anything i can try without actually compiling, im all up for it.
