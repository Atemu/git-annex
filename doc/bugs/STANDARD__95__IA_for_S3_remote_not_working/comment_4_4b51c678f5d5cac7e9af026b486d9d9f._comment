I've added something to `git annex version` about this today:
"S3(storageclasses)"

The prebuilt linux builds currently use package versions from Debian 
unstable, so we have to wait for the aws package to get updated there.
(I could hand-hack it, but that would make the build break later.)

The Windows and OSX builds have already been updated; the latter only just
now, so it'll be in the next daily build. Updating the Android build
environment is a massive pain and I try to only do that bi-anually.
