I mean, yes, that is an error message that can occur due to some newbie
haskell mistake, OTOH I have been writing haskell for 10 years and
generally don't make that mistake anymore and why would it only occur on
OSX on FAT?

Also, when I do that newbie mistake on purpose, the error message I get includes the
name of the file that it's having trouble with. It's strange that the error
message you show did not.

	joey@darkstar:~>cp /etc/passwd foo
	joey@darkstar:~>ghci
	GHCi, version 8.4.4: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
	Loaded GHCi configuration from /home/joey/.etc/.ghci
	ghci> readFile  "foo" >>= writeFile "foo"
	*** Exception: foo: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)

This makes me wonder if you censored the filename from the message. The lack
of specifics about exactly which git-annex commands do this and which don't
also does not help me in trying to think about your problem.

I suggest you use dtrace or something to examine the system calls that
git-annex is making, which should give a hint about which file it's having
the problem with.
