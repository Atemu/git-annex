A few problems with using git-annex this way..

git init fails in sdcard because it tries to chmod something. It works in
the termux home directory. Note that only the git bundled with git-annex
has this problem; the termux one works (probably it's patched like I did in
the android git-annex port). Hacking the standalone build to not run the
bundled git should work. This could be done only when uname -o = Android.

git annex init fails with a getUserEntryForID exception. 
[[!commit 526243d6f5db6e16c32ed7f835da590b877f78b8]] probably fixed this,
but not tested yet.

The webapp doesn't know how to open an url, but copy and paste of the
url to a web browser works and the webapp mostly works then. It should
be able to use termux-open.

Accessing the sdcard may need termux-setup-storage to be run once, 
depending on the version of android. That sets up $HOME/storage.

webbapp won't start on boot, but could be made to using https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:Boot
