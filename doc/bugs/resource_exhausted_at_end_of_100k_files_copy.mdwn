Ran git-annex copy --to origin in a repo with 100k files. origin was a
local git repo. 
After all the files were transferred, it died with a fork resource
exhausted, too many open files or something like that.

.git/annex/journal/ had 76k files in it. git-annex merge dealt with it
without a problem. --[[Joey]]
