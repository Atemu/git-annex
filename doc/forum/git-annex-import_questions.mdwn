Some questions about git-annex-import: (1) To where in the repository, exactly, are the files imported?  The manpage does not seem to specify.  What happens if two files with same basenames but different contents are imported from different paths -- where in the repository do they go?  (2) There is no --batch option; would that be hard to add? (3) Is there a way to import a file into the annex only, without creating a symlink to it from the working copy? (4) When you import a directory, does this recursively import the full tree under it?  Also, just to note, the command name may be confusing two users, because (5) it deletes the original files by default, which most import commands do not do, and (6) it is unrelated to git-annex-export.
Thanks!
