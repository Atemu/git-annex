Making some progress. It looks like it needs a .map file for the newly added file when I pull in the backup repo.  I'm tracing the various places addAssociatedFile gets called. It looks like sync should do it. I think that's what sets up the map. If I copy the map file from another repo, I'm able to call get annex get foo2.txt. So the key is getting that map file created.
