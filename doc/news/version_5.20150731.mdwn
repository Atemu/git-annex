[[!toggleable text="""
   * webapp: Support enabling known gitlab.com remotes.
   * Fix rsync special remote to work when -Jn is used for concurrent
     uploads.
   * The last release accidentially removed a number of options from the
     copy command. (-J, file matching options, etc). These have been added
     back.
   * init: Detect when the filesystem is crippled such that it ignores
     attempts to remove the write bit from a file, and enable direct mode.
     Seen with eg, NTFS fuse on linux.
   * Fix man page installation by cabal install; all the new man pages are
     now installed."""]]
