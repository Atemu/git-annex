I filed the bug because I thought the inconsistent behavior was bad.  For example;  If you move the data to a repo which doesn't know about the unsynced remote, it'll happily get dropped with dropunused as opposed to being considered in use in the current repo.

There probably aren't too many people who want to have remotes set that are usually unreachable, and I can work around it now that I know it exists.

If it is expected behavior, feel free to close the bug.
