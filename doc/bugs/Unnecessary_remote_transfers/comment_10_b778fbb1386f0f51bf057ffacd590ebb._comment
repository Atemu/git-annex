Thanks, Joey.  I didn't realize that there were two instances of the assistant running.

Forgive my ignorance, but if I disable the assistant running in the backup repo, will the other assistant still backup files to it?

Also, from a UI perspective, does the webapp currently not seem to support secondary internal drives, at least in a useful way?
