When in direct mode, renaming a file with `git mv` does not update the
direct mode mapping to use the new filename. --[[Joey]]

Consistency checks now prevent anything bad happening when the mapping file
contains old filenames. Still, missing the new filename will prevent that
file working properly in direct mode.

Perhaps the pre-commit hook needs to update the mapping for files that were
deleted or added.

This also affects moves of files when the assistant is being used.
In this case, the assistant updates the mapping to add the new name,
but does not delete the old name from the mapping.

> [[done]]; the pre-commit hook now updates the mappings. --[[Joey]]
