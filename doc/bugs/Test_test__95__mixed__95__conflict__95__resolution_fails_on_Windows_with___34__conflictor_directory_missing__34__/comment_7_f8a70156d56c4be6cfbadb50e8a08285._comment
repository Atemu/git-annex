Alright, I've grabbed the latest autobuild and have tested again with 5.20140130-gcb99900.  Back to failing just this one test case.  Compared to my last two comments, the test appears to be getting further along before failing.

        conflict_resolution (mixed directory and file):   Detected a filesystem without fifo support.
      Disabling ssh connection caching.
      Detected a crippled filesystem.
      Enabling direct mode.
