The gpg calls in that log are being done by git-annex, not by
git-remote-gcrypt.

I think this is decryptCipher, which can run gpg --decrypt and didn't
get annex.gnupg-decrypt-options wired up to it. Although normally the
creds would be cached when the special remote is set up or the first time
it's used and should not need to be decrypted again.

Threading gnupg-decrypt-options through to decryptCipher looks likely to
involve nearly a full day's work.
