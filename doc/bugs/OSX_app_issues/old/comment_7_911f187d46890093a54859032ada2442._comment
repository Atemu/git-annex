@Nico, that's actually kind of promising; people have been reporting much earlier crashes with OSX. This later crash is one I think I can do something about! :)

So, it looks like the standalone app build needs to run the web browser in a clean environment that doesn't use any of its bundled libraries. I've committed that change and it will be in a release later today.
