`git-annex add .foo` will add the file to the annex, unless your
annex.largefiles is otherwise configured. There is no special handling
of largefiles for dotfiles[1].

But `git-annex add` skips dotfiles unless explicitly listed.
It always has! There's a --include-dotfiles you can use to override that
default.

I don't see a bug here, except possibly the description on the man page
could mention it skipping dotfiles. But the existance of the option
does make the skipping be documented.

[1] Although, the default .git/info/attributes does only apply
the annex filter to non-dotfiles. So `git add .foo` adds it to git and
not to git-annex. That's a little bit cheezy, but the alternative was to
have a different annex.largefiles setting for `git add` than for `git-annex
add`
