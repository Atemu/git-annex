That comment was just bad wording or possibly I conflated S3 with how other
remotes that do use hash directories work. I've corrected the comment.

According to Amazon's documentation, S3 does not have a concept of
directories; "foo/bar" and "foo_bar" and "foo\\bar" are all just opaque
strings as far as it's concerned. So I don't see any point in using hash
directories with S3.
