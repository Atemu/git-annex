\"verify with checksums parts of the file and re-download only those parts/chunks, that are bad.\" -- if I understand correctly, git-annex doesn't checksum [[chunks|chunking]], but can tell incompletely downloaded chunks based on size.

My original use case (registering the presence of a chunked file in a remote without downloading it) might be implementable with [[todo/setpresentkey_option_to_record_chunked_state/]].  The checksums of the chunks would not be used though.
