# Populating the cache
For the cache to be used, you need to get file contents into it somehow. A simple way to do that is, in a git-annex repository that already contains the content of files:

    git annex copy --to cache

You could run that anytime after you get content. There are also ways to automate it, but getting some files into the cache manually is a good enough start.
```

Hi Joey.  What would be the preferred way you would advise to use (ideally with minimal manual configuration) to make it happen? I.e. whenever user(s) `get` some load, it gets automagically `annex copied` to the cache?
