Maybe it could read \"Could not verify that enough copies of the file exist to safely drop it\". Or \"Could not verify that enough other repositories contain this file to safely drop it.\"

It might be cool (if this isn't supported already) if there was a command to drop a file that would automatically copy it to another repo first if needed to satisfy numcopies.
