The git-annex Windows port is not ready for prime time. But it does exist
now! --[[Joey]] 

## status

* Does not work with Cygwin's build of git (that git does not consistently
  support use of DOS style paths, which git-annex uses on Windows). 
  Must use the upstream build of git for Windows.
* rsync special remotes are known buggy.
* Bad file locking, it's probably not safe to run more than one git-annex
  process at the same time on Windows.
* No support for the assistant or webapp.
* Ssh connection caching does not work on Windows, so `git annex get`
  has to connect twice to the remote system over ssh per file, which
  is much slower than on systems supporting connection caching.
