@Abd√≥, @Markus, you suggested using submodules. git-annex recently added
support for submodules, in version 5.20150317. May still be a little
rough.

@diafygi, `git annex add .` defaults to not adding dotfiles. This is
documented, and there is a --include-dotfiles switch, or you can explicitly
list the dotfiles you want to add.

@Bruno, most of your questions are answered by the thread which appears
before them.

(I think this bug report may be reaching the end of its usefulness, since
people seem to want to use it to pile on about a bunch of unrelated topics.
Please keep this on topic.)
