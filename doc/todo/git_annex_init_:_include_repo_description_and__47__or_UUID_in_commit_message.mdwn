Would help alot when having to add large(ish) amounts of remotes.

Maybe detect this kind of commit message and ask user whether to automatically add them? See [[auto_remotes]]:
> Question: When should git-annex update the remote.log? (If not just on init.) Whenever it reads in a repo's remotes?

----

I'm not sure that the above suggestion is going down a path that really
makes sense. If you want a list of repository UUIDs and descriptions,
it's there in machine-usable form in `.git-annex/uuid.log`, there is no
need to try to pull this info out of git commit messages. --[[Joey]]
