Hi,

My Webapp isn't working: 
    
    $ git-annex webapp error: refs/gcrypt/gitception+ does not point to a valid object! 
    error: refs/remotes/Beta/git-annex does not point to a valid object! 
    error: refs/remotes/Beta/master does not point to a valid object! 
    fatal: unable to read tree 656e7db5be172f01c0b6994d01f1a08d1273af12

So I tried to repair it: 

    $ git-annex repair Running git fsck ... 
    Stack space overflow: current size 8388608 bytes. Use `+RTS -Ksize -RTS' to increase it.

So I tried to follow your advice here and increase the stack: 

    $ git-annex +RTS -K35000000 -RTS fsck 
    git-annex: Most RTS options are disabled. Link with -rtsopts to enable them.

I wasn't sure what to do next, so any help would be appreciated.
