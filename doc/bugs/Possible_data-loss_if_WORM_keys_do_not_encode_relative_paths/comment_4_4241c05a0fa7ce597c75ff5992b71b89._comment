> Rather than saying that the relative path adds additional entropy, what I was aiming at is the file-system cannot have two alternate versions of one file name at the same path with the same mtime

True of a single filesystem, but not of a set of connected git repositories. :)

So there are multiple scenarios when encoding the file path in the key doesn't help. The probabilities of these seem low, but perhaps not as low as the probability that there will be two differing files with the same name+size+mtime in the first place. It's not clear to me that it adds more than a false sense of security to change from basename to git filename.
