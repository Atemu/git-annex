I uninstalled udevil in favor of udiskie, which uses a mount point name based on the label instead of the device, updated the directory to point at the new mount point with `git annex enableremote pi1541 <new mount point>/1541`, and the problem went away. But it doesn't seem like having different mount points for removable devices should be a requirement.
