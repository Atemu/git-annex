That's fabulous.  A Bash alias around that command is really all I need when working in direct mode.  (And the archive's too damn big to switch back and forth between direct/indirect.)

I was just too much a newb with git attributes to know it could be done that way.  For discoverability, maybe that command could be placed in an \"examples\" section in the primary documentation above?
