Been making some improvements to `git-annex export` over the past couple
days, but took time off this afternoon to set up a new phone, and try
[git-annex in termux](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/install_on_Android_in_Termux/)
on it. Luckily, I was able to reproduce the signal 11
on arm64 problem that several users have reported earlier, and also found a fix,
which is simply to build git-annex for arm64.

So I want to set up a [[todo/arm64_autobuilder]], and if someone has an
arm64 server that could host it, that would be great. Otherwise, I could
use Scaleway, but I'd rather avoid that ongoing expense.

Also fixed a recent reversion in the linux standalone 
runshell that broke git-annex in termux, and probably on some other
systems.
