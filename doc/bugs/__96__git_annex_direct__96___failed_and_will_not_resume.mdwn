I let it try to resume for a very long time (about a day) and it did nothing.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

6.20170818 on Gentoo Linux

### Please provide any additional information below.

This is a fairly large repository which was only just cloned and with all data transferred (`git clone` and `git annex get .` worked fine).
