The hash speed is not really significant; re-reading the content of the
file to hash it is the expensive part. At some point git-annex may gain the
ability to do this on the fly as it's being downloaded and then the
verification overhead would be negligible.

Thanks for mentioning BLAKE2.. I've added support for it!
