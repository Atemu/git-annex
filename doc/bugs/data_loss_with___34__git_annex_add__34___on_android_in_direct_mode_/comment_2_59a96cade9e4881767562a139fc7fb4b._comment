*Are you sure these files did not already have the same content before you ran git-annex on them?*

Yes, each one was a distinct photo, video, or audio recording.  The only operation performed between creation and ``git annex add`` was moving them into the import directory from the command line via e.g. ``mv /sdcard/DCIM/Camera/* .``.

If you'd like, I'll try to find a set of files to reproduce the problem with.

*Can you show me the output of git show when run on some of these files?*

Sure.  Here are two WAV files.  The first one was correctly stored, and the second one is now a duplicate of the first.
