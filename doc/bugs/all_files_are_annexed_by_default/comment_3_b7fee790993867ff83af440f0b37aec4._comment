My \"upgrade to most recent version\" advice should have mentioned that the most recent version is 8.*, which will auto-upgrade your repositories to version 8.   If for whatever reason you don't want to do the upgrade right now, 7.* versions from 7.20191024 restore old behavior, as Kyle suggested.  Note  that if you have `annex.largefiles` configured, `git add` will add matching files to the annex, unless `annex.gitaddtoannex`.
