The only other thing I can think of is that if you have a ssh-agent, it might somehow be caching the git-annex key and incorrectly sending it to ssh. If this were the case, then unsetting `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` or stopping the agent would presumably make the problem go away.

In @marvin's log, I see:

<pre>
debug1: Offering RSA public key: marvin@marvin-U-100
</pre>

This is different from what I see when ssh is using a regular key in `.ssh/`:

<pre>
debug1: Offering RSA public key: /home/joey/.ssh/id_rsa
</pre>

Marvin's log does not show where it gets this \"marvin@marvin-U-100\".. which makes me suspect it comes from a ssh agent.
