I couldn't find an explanation for this using the search bar, so I thought this would be as good a place as any to ask this.

Even when I run `git mv` on git annexed file, git annex always changes it for what looks like a combo of `git rm old_symlink; git add new_symlink`

I guess it does this when that pre-commit hook you mentioned runs.
Why?
