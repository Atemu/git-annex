It's not a dependency. It's a recommends. 

apt does not install new recommends that get added to a package. Adding that recommends only causes it to be installed by default when new users install the package

This seems to be the best I can do, short of adding a separate git-annex-assistant package, which could depend on ssh-askpass.
Might not be a bad idea..
