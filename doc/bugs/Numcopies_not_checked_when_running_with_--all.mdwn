### Please describe the problem.
There are a lot of differences in the behaviour of usual commands and commans using --all.
The specific problem I found was that "git annex fsck --all" will only checksum it seems and not report back numcopies failures.
Checking if objects/old versions have propagated is not possible without it or do I miss something.

(As additional note not sure if related. It seems that git annex fsck --all is running much faster in my tests 1/3 faster. Any reason for that? Bug related?)


### What steps will reproduce the problem?
compare "git annex fsck" vs "git annex fsck" (no numcopies check)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 5.20140210-gd99db49
Linux (Ubuntu 13.10)

### Please provide any additional information below.
