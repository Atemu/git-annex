 Yesterday, I encountered a problem with my hp printer. It's working fine a few days ago but when I tried to print my essential papers, at that moment, I noticed my printer had given me a communication error, which is your hp printer offline in windows 10. After seeing this error I got a little bit afraid and think about how to fix the hp printer offline windows 10 error.
