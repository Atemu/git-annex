Landed two final changes before the release..

First, made git-annex detect if any of the several long-running git process
it talks to have died, and restart them. My stress test is reliably able to
get at least `git cat-file` to crash, and while I don't know why (and
obviously should follow up by getting a core dump and stack trace of it),
the assistant needs to deal with this to be robust.

Secondly, wrote rather a lot of java code to better open the web browser
when the Android app is started. A thread listens for urls to be written to
a fifo. Creating a fifo from fortran^Wjava code is .. interesting. Glad to
see the back of the `am` command; it did me no favors.

AFK
