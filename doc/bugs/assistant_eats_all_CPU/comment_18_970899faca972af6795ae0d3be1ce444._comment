Hi Joey, I have also experienced this bug.  I put my \"~/my\" folder under gitannex's management, and I've since had gitannex's assistant consume a CPU (100% of one core) when starting my computer for 1 - 12 hours (at which point I get impatient and kill annex).  If stack traces would help, I can email you those.  Unfortunately, my \"my\" folder includes every important document I've created, coded, or needed, in the last six years.  It has just under 30,000 files, and probably isn't using gitannex the way it's intended to be used.  You can see the distribution of files and file sizes in the tables below.

If gitannex isn't designed for this sort of use case, can you recommend any free software tools that might be able to help opportunistically keep files in sync at this sort of scale, like GA?

Thanks for your time,

Nick
