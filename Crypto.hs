{- The beginning of a Cipher is used for MAC'ing; the remainder is used
 - as the GPG symmetric encryption passphrase when using the hybrid
 - scheme. Note that the cipher itself is base-64 encoded, hence the
 - string is longer than 'cipherSize': 683 characters, padded to 684.
 -
 - The 256 first characters that feed the MAC represent at best 192
 - bytes of entropy.  However that's more than enough for both the
 - default MAC algorithm, namely HMAC-SHA1, and the "strongest"
 - currently supported, namely HMAC-SHA512, which respectively need
 - (ideally) 64 and 128 bytes of entropy.
 -
 - The remaining characters (320 bytes of entropy) is enough for GnuPG's
 - symetric cipher; unlike weaker public key crypto, the key does not
 - need to be too large.
