`git annex fsck --from remote`

Basically, this needs to receive each file in turn from the remote, to a
temp file, and then run the existing fsck code on it. Could be quite
expensive, but sometimes you really want to check.

An unencrypted directory special remote could be optimised, by not actually
copying the file, just dropping a symlink, etc.

The WORM backend doesn't care about file content, so it would be nice to
avoid transferring the content at all, and only send the size.
