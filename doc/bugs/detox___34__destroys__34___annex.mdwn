### Please describe the problem.

I accidentally (my fault!) run detox (batch file renamer to eliminate spaces etc.) on a git-annex dir, alas detox substitutes every "--" with "-", thus "destroying" my annex. Of course the objects are still there, just renamed so that the symlinks are now all broken.

I solved it by copying the objects back from my backup (I have many rsynced backups) since I was too lazy to write a script to rename all the files...

A good solution would be to provide a general script (or there is one already?) to try to recover situations like this one, maybe using shatag to identify data objects.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Just run detox -vr (verbose, recursive) on an annex

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20150819+g

Linux

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)


I currently have about a dozen annexes, local and remote (nfs, git), no other big problem apart from lac of speed when syncing
