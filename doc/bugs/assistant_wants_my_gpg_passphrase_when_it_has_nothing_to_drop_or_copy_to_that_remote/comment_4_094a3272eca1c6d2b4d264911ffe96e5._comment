The rsync remote is in the archive group but it has the preferred content string `exclude=video/* and exclude=ttmik/*`.  So it ought to be dropping the files, but not over and over again.

Here is the log file, showing me hitting Escape on the pinentry dialog:

    (scanning...) Already up-to-date.
