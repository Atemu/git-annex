This looks suspiciously like git-annex has been built with the EKG flag
enabled. That is disabled by default and only useful for debugging
performace problems. When enabled, git-annex includes a EKG web server,
so only one git-annex program can be run at once.

Please file a bug on the gentoo package to get EKG turned off, if it is in
fact enabled.

You can check if it is by going to http://localhost:4242/ 
while a git-annex command is running. Or, look at "git annex version"
and see if EKG is included in the list of flags.
