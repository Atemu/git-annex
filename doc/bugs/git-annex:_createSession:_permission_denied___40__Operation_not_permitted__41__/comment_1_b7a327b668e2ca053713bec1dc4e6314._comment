createSession just calls the unix `setsid` system call.

I have not been able to reproduce this problem using git-annex here. I suspect setsid is probably failing because git-annex is already a process group leader due to the way it was run. In this case, it should just ignore the setsid failure, which I've made it do.

This change will be available in the standalone tarball within an hour if you want to test it.
