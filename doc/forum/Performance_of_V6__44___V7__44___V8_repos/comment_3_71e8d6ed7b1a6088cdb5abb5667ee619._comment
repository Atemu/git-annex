`git annex add` does not result in the smudge filter being run.

You could configure git not to run the filters ever (see git docs) but then
git-annex features involving unlocked files will of course break.

Could I suggest that, in general, you wait until you have actually
seen git-annex behave badly before worrying about it? (This is in the
context of also having seen some other comments you made elsewhere.)
That also lets you file concrete bug reports, rather than posting worries
that may be ungrounded.
