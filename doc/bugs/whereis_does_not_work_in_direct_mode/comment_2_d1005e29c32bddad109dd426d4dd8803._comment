It seems to me that there are only 3 ways that pc2 could not know that pc1 has the file, in decreasing order of probability:

1. pc1 has not pushed git-annex branch to origin (or pushed it after pc2 pulled)
2. pc2 has not fetched git-annex branch from origin
3. an actual bug, such as bad info being written to the git-annex branch or the git-annex branch merge failing

So, if you have 3 repositories that exhibit a problem like this, those are the things to check.
