Locking down git-annex-shell should be the same process as locking down
git-shell. It intentionally copies git-shell's behavior to make this as
easy as possible, and to make git-annex-shell a drop-in replacement for
git-shell in things like gitolite.

I double-checked with this in my `authorized_keys`:

command="~/.ssh/git-annex-shell" ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAICfFntnesZcYz2B2T41ay45igfckXRSh5uVffkuCQkLv joey@darkstar

Which is using the standard git-annex-shell wrapper script. It works.

I guess you've either made some mistake in your setup, or possibly
`SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND` isn't getting set. I don't know why that would
happen, but it should be easy enough to modify your script to test.
Just make it `set -x` ..
