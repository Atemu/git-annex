I just wanted to say thanks to andrew for a really excellent response here.
I've answered plenty of such questions less well.
I hope you answer many more questions about git-annex with such care and
attention to detail.

And, thanks to MatusGoljer for following up to confirm that you were
misunderstanding -- and I agree that you should be able to adjust the
preferred content expression to do what you want it to do.
