Just playing with git-annex which looks great so far, but I noticed that when you make use off "git annex assistant" to watch and sync your repo with the remote it doesn't drop files anymore. They just stay in the repo.

What I have is the following:

- 2 repo's in direct mode
- they both have each other as remote
- they're synced and stay synced with the assistant daemon running (in both repo's started "git annex assistant")
- is see changes coming and precessed, so so far so good.

Then I drop in one repo a path for instance like : git annex drop iso
Afterwards I still see the files (and contents) in that repo. New files in the iso path are still synced to the other and vise versa.

Then I kill the assistant on both side's and drop the path again. This time it's dropped as expected and the contents of the file in the iso path are gone.
Starting the assistant again brings is back though :(

I really liked the assistant feature and possibility of dropping the files from one repo, but they don't seem to work together.

Is this a bur or expected behaviour? I think the latter since the assistant also does the git annex get commands so sounds logical?
