### Please describe the problem.

Changing a file in a repository from a symlink to a normal file causes annex to create an annexed file from that typechange regardless of weather or not it was an annexed file.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    git init newrepo
    cd newrepo && git annex init
    touch realfile
    git add .
    git commit -m "added realfile"
    mkdir newdir && cd newdir
    ln -s ../realfile newfile
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added placeholder until we get assets from designers"
    rm newfile
    dd bs=1024 count=10000 if=/dev/zero of=newfile
    git add .
    git commit -m "Finally got assets from designers"
    ls -la newfile
    # lrwxrwxrwx 1 user user <date> newfile -> ../.git/annex/objects/XX/XX/UUID/UUID
