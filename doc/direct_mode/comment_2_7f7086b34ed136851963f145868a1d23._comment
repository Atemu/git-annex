All git commands that do not change files in the work tee (and do not stage files from the work tree), are safe. I don't have a complete list; it includes `git log`, `git show`, `git diff`, `git commit` (but not -a or with a file as a parameter), `git branch`, `git fetch`, `git push`, `git grep`, `git status`, `git tag`, `git mv` (this one is somewhat surprising, but I've tested it and it's ok)

git commands that change files in the work tree will replace your data with dangling symlinks. This includes things like `git revert`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, `git pull`, `git reset`

git commands that stage files from the work tree will commit your data to git directly. This includes `git add`, `git commit -a`, and `git commit file`
