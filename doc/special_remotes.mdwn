Most [[backends]] can transfer data to and from configured git remotes.
Normally those remotes are normal git repositories (bare and non-bare),
that store the file contents in their own git annex directory.

But, git-annex also extends git's concept of remotes, with these special
types of remotes. These can be used just like any normal remote by git-annex.
They cannot be used by other git commands though.
