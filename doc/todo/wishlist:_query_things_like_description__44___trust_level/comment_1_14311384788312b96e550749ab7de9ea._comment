`git annex describe` only sets the description to avoid complication. Imagine using it in a script for example.

`git annex status` shows the description. It does not show the trust level because I have not thought of a visually pleasing and compact way to show it in the repository list there.. suggestions appreciated, since the same list is used by `whereis`, and showing trust levels there would be particularly useful.
