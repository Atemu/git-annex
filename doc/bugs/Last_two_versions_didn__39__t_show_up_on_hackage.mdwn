### Please describe the problem.
I don't know how the packages at hackage are managed, but the last version there is 4.20130601 while in the mean time there have been two other releases.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Check [[http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/git-annex/]]

> Thanks for reporting. Turns out that hackage was rejecting

> am not sure I have the right name either, I have removed those bits
> and re-uploaded.
