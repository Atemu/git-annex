git-annex import without --content does not copy files at all, so the disk
IO would AFAICS be it hashing files. (Unless you have annex.synccontent
set.)

But when it does transfer the imported file from the remote, either at sync time 
or because of a later get, it currently does not make reflinks. That should
be relatively easy to fix.

Of course, if you can get the content into the git-annex repository by
other means like manual cp --reflink, git-annex will never have any reason
to transfer the imported file from the remote, so that workaround would
work.
