Starting the new year with
[new git-annex development funding](https://joeyh.name/blog/entry/git-annex_and_funding_update/)
for most of the things on the [[design/roadmap]]!

Today was spent converting the UUID data type to use a ByteString, rather
than a String, and also converting repo descriptions to ByteString.
That's groundwork for reading and writing log files on the git-annex
branch using attoparsec and ByteString builders, which will hopefully
improve performance.

Until that's complete, it will often convert a String to a ByteString and
then back to a String, which could actually make performance slightly
worse. Benchmarking `git annex whereis` doesn't find much of a change. It
may have gotten a slightly faster overall, due to the faster Eq and
Ord instances making the map of repositories faster.
