Dear joey,

thanks a lot for fixing this!

Only for this protocol (not to have the last word ;-)

What `git annex add` already does now and what i suggested it could do better is indead the same (result) for uncorrupted files (the frequent case).
But i'am afraid, it could be slightly different if we deal with corrupted files. The preset behaviour would add this file, the suggested behaviour would not...

But this discussion is history now - i'm lucky :-))

Now i do some tests with daylight savings time change - hopefully there are no problems!
