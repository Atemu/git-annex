ATM git-annex init on a new clone would try to sense the remote regarding git-annex support and would try to fetch its /config.  If that fails it would announce that remote ignored for annex.

[[!format sh """
...
Switched to branch 'adjusted/master(unlocked)'
download failed: Not Found

  Remote origin not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore

"""]]
and that download failed, thanks to --debug output comes from
[[!format sh """

IMHO that "download failed: " message output should be provided only in `--debug` mode.  Otherwise, if exposed to naive user it is an uninformative alarm, which (if he/she knows) is clarified by the follow up message ("Remote origin not usable ...")
