A \"small archive\" only wants to contain files that are located inside archive/ directories.

That seems to explain everything you reported except for:

> 6. but the sizes are really small, seems that the actual files are not being transferred

Maybe the remote is configured to use chunking? What happens if you run `git annex fsck --from $remotename` after copying a file to it? Any problem detected?

> The add remote interface stops at \"check remote\" prompt for a long time without completing

Please explain exactly what you did in the webapp. What did you click on, and what did you enter? I need enough detail to be able to reproduce the problem.

(Also, in the future, one problem per bug report turns out to be a lot less confusing, and have better results all around. True here and really anywhere..)
