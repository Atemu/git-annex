I've fixed this bug. After upgrading to git-annex 6.20160414 or newer,
if you have such files in your repository, you will need to force git-annex
to update its list of unlocked files, by running:

	git annex init --version=6

You may also need to run `git annex fsck` on the files to properly populate
them with their content. Do it after the above command.

(There were also some bugs that lost the execute bit; fixed those too.)

(The comment about windows is not about this bug at all, but an entirely
different, and already fixed bug.)
