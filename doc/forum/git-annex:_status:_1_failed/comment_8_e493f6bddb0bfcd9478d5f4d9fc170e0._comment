Quick question: Is there any way to get rid of the error in the existing repository (e.g. remove the problematic tmp file entry) so I can get a complete status output? Bonus points if I don't have to annex every single file anew. `git annex fsck` doesn't work, as doesn't `git annex fix` (it's a direct repo).
