Hi,

So while writing the globus special remote (git-annex-remote-globus) I often redirect my logs to annex. Nevertheless these logs are always logged out in the console, them being INFO, ERROR, DEBUG and I would like to control that. Is there a way to disable console logging of logs sent back to git annex?

Something like ANNEX_LOG_LEVEL=self.annex.ERROR

Thanks !!

Regards
Giulia
