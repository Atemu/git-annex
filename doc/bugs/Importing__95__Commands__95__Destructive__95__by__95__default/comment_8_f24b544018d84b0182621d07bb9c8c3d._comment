That all makes sense Joey/CandyAngel. I do wonder how this command will change though if [import tree](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/import_tree/) is ever implemented. I presume the default behavior of `git annex import treeish` would preserve the source tree as if the option `--duplicate` had been given? Whereas `git annex import path` would continue to move files by default. But maybe this is another reason not to do `git annex import treeish`, maybe that command should be `git annex importtree treeish`?

In terms of the anonymous poster's suggestions of changing the options to import, I would say all of your suggestions already exist in a usable form “skip existing known files” is already an option `--skip-duplicates`, “--remove-source==never” is already an option `--duplicate` and presumably “--reinject-missing” is similar to the existing option `--force`.
