Similar to how

    git commit -m 'foo'

works, if I run 

    git annex sync -m 'my hovercraft is full of eels'

git annex should use that commit message instead of the default ones. That way, I could use [[sync]] directly and not be forced to commit prior to syncing just to make sure I have a useful commit message.
