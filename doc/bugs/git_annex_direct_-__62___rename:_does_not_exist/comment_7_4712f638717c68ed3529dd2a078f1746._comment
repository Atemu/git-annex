You can download a current build of git-annex from
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Linux_standalone>

I've already linked to that once before in this very thread!

I am going to close this bug. Please followup if you anage to a) get a
current git-annex build installed and b) can then provide instructions to
reproduce this bug using it.
