### Please describe the problem.

docs say
GETURLS Key Prefix
Gets the recorded urls where a Key can be downloaded from. Only urls that start with the Prefix will be returned. The Prefix may be empty to get all urls. (git-annex replies one or more times with VALUE for each url. The final VALUE has an empty value, indicating the end of the url list.

but when I am trying with a prefix -- doesn't return any... expected that one which is present and returned if I don't provide any prefix

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git clone git://github.com/yarikoptic/datalad -b nf-custom-remotes
cd datalad
# there are requirements in requirements.txt, which you might need to install... or just do on smaug
git checkout 5b9cfd5008151c515f8bccadf39451055ab61b4b  
DATALAD_LOGLEVEL=1 DATALAD_LOGTARGET=stderr tools/testing/make_test_repo archive r1

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
