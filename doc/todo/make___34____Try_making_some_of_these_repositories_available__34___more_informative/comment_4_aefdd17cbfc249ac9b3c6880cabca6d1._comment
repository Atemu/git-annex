This risks changing the --json output. Eg currently it has:

	{"command":"get","wanted":[{"here":false,"uuid":"7f03b57d-5923-489a-be26-1ab254d0620d","description":"archive-13 [house]"}],"note":"from house...\nrsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer\nUnable to access these remotes: house\nTry making some of these repositories available:\n\t7f03b57d-5923-489a-be26-1ab254d0620d -- archive-13 [house]\n","skipped":[]

The "wanted" list comes from the display of the list of
uuids, but now there would be up to 3 lists displayed.

I doubt anything uses that, but I don't want to change the json,
so I suppose it would need to keep the current behavior when json is
enabled, ugh.
