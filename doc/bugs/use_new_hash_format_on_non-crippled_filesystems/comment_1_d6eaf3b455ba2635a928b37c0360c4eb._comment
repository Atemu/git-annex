I think you should simply `git annex adjust --unlock` in that repository.
Get rid of the symlinks from it, and the case sensitivity issues will, I
hope, not matter. This is the same thing git-annex automatically does when
initializating a repo on a crippled filesystem.

The other way would be to set annex.tune.objecthashlower=true, see
[[tuning]], but that can only be done when setting up a new repository,
since it makes the lower-case hash be used everywhere. (Which is what I'd do
if I had a time machine.)
