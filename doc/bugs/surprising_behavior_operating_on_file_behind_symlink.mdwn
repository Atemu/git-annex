If foo is a symlink to bar, and foo/file exists, then `git annex add bar/file`
silently does nothing. So do other commands if the file is already annexed.

git's behavior on these is to complain that it's "beyond a symbolic link"
and fail.

This happens because git ls-files doesn't list the file, but then I think
the code that handles erroring if a file that does not exist is specified
doesn't catch it because the file does exist, it's just behind the symlink.
