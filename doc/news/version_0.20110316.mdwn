News for git-annex 0.20110316:

   This version reorganises the layout of git-annex's files in your repository.
   There is an upgrade process to convert a repository from the old git-annex
   to this version. While git-annex will attempt to transparently handle
   upgrades, you may want to drive the upgrade process by hand.

git-annex 0.20110316 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * New repository format, annex.version=2.
   * The first time git-annex is run in an old format repository, it
     will automatically upgrade it to the new format, staging all
     necessary changes to git. Also added a "git annex upgrade" command.
   * Colons are now avoided in filenames, so bare clones of git repos
     can be put on USB thumb drives formatted with vFAT or similar
     filesystems.
   * Added two levels of hashing to object directory and .git-annex logs,
     to improve scalability with enormous numbers of annexed
     objects. (With one hundred million annexed objects, each
     directory would contain fewer than 1024 files.)
   * The setkey, fromkey, and dropkey subcommands have changed how
     the key is specified. --backend is no longer used with these."""]]
