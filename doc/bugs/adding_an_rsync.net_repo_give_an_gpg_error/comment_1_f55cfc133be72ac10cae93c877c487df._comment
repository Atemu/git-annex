I'm seeing some indications (this bug and also the [[git_annex_fork_bombs_on_gpg_file]] bug) that gpg is somehow broken on OSX.

Aha. I just tried on my build box, and:

<pre>
oberon:~ joeyh$ gpg
dyld: warning, LC_RPATH @loader_path/../lib in /usr/local/bin/gpg being ignored in restricted program because of @loader_path
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libz.1.2.7.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/gpg
  Reason: image not found
</pre>

So, I'm packing up a broken gpg. Need to fix that then..
