This is what I get in the log in version 5.20140221 in Debian Sid:

    100%         46.5KB/s 0sInternalIOException <socket: 28>: hPutBuf: illegal operation (handle is closed)
    InternalIOException <socket: 25>: hPutBuf: illegal operation (handle is closed)

It seams that the file is being uploaded (folders are being created in box.com) but it crashes when reaching 100%
