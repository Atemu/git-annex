From my tests, Rsync actually seems to honor the bandwidth limit that's in the sender's options. In particular, a dirty hard-coding of the limit in <tt>Utility.Rsync.rsyncServerParams</tt> (forwarding the option from <tt>git-annex-shell</tt> to the actuall rsync command, and) did the trick for me.

I know Rsync merely tries to respect <tt>bwlimit</tt> on average, but for large files it's good enough I think. And for those like me who have a volume quota on their connection, it'd a plus to make <tt>git-annex-shell</tt> respect that limit. Well of course I could ask my users to use something like <tt>trickle</tt>, but external commands are more likely to be forgotten than a config option ;-)

I couldn't see where in the code you whitelist the list of safe commands; Did you mean there is already such a thing, or is it empty right now? In any case, my wish doesn't seem to be hard to implement, and I'd be happy to try to provide a patch in the next few days.
