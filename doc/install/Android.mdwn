Now git-annex can be used on Android!

[[Documentation for using git-annex on Android|/android]]

## Android app

First, ensure your Android device is configured to allow installation
of the app. Go to Setup -&gt; Security, and enable "Unknown Sources".

[Download the git-annex.apk](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/android/current/)
onto your Android device, and open it to install.

## autobuilds

A daily build is also available, thanks to Mesar Hameed and the University
of Bath CS department.

* [download apk](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/android/git-annex.apk) ([build logs](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/android/))

## building it yourself

git-annex can be built for Android, with `make android`. It's not an easy
process:

* First, install <https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android>.
* You will need to have the Android SDK and NDK installed; see
  `standalone/android/Makefile` to configure the paths to them. You'll also
  need ant, and the JDK.
* In `standalone/android/`, run `install-haskell-packages native`
* You also need to install git and all the utilities listed on [[fromscratch]],
  on the system doing the building.
* Then to build the full Android app bundle, use `make androidapp`
