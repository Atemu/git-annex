Note that the assistant generates initremote parameters so code there also needs to be changed if the syntax changes.

I think I am ok with changing the syntax. However, it seems that `encryption=-oldkey encryption=newkey` could be used to remove the old revoked key and add a new one. Using `-keyid` as a parameter to initremote is a bit tricky since git-annex's regular option parser would see it, before the parameter could get to initremote. (Unless -keyid was defined as a regular option specific to initremote.) OR, git-annex could just try to detect when a key is revoked and automatically remove it when a new encryption key is specified.

Hmm,Â it would be possible to have it just notice, when adding a new key, if one of the existing keys is revoked, and
remove the revoked key automatically.

The above doesn't deal with the case of wanting to add pure asymmetric encryption. It seems to me that from a user's point of view, what they really need to know about asymmetric encryption is that they can't easily give additional keyids access after the fact (without reencrypting and reuploading everything). So I think it would be good if the syntax made that obvious. Perhaps `encryptiononly=key`
