Hmm, so it seems there is almost a way to do this already.

I think the one thing that isn't currently possible is to have 'plain' ssh remotes.. basically something just like the directory remote, but able to take a ssh user@host/path url.  something like sshfs could be used to fake this, but for things like fsck you would want to do the sha1 calculations on the remote host.
