What steps will reproduce the problem?

I downloaded the os x assistant today.

I'd previously installed it but hadn't linked it to another repo.

I tried to create a remote repo on an ssh server using the assistant.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Creating a remote repo or giving an understandable error message.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20121212
OS X 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion)

The remote machine is running debian stable.

Please provide any additional information below.

Internal Server Error
user error (gpg ["--quiet","--trust-model","always","--gen-random","--armor","1","512"] exited 127)
git-annex version 3.20121212
