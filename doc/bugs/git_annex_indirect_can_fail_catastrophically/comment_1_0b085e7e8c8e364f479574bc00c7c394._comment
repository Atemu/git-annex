Worse than  being stuck partway converted, it fails in such a way that the file you can't write to is left stuck in .git/annex/objects/ without a symlink pointint to it. 

Here is how to recover:

1. run `git annex direct`
2. run `git annex indirect`
3. run `git annex direct`
4. run `git annex indirect`
5. run `git revert HEAD`
6. run `git annex direct`
7. fix the permission of the file
8. run `git annex indirect`

Please don't ask me why this works, but it will..
