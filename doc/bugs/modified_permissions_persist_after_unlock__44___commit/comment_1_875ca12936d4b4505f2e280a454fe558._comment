I am unable to reproduce any problem with the steps you gave. I don't see any typechange message, and would not expect one. Perhaps your repository is lacking a .git/hooks/pre-commit script to run git-annex when you use `git commit -a`?

It's not clear to me what problem you experienced, beyond the typechange message that I don't see.

> git unlock test.txt (corrects and retains both versions)

I don't understand that line at all. `git unlock` is not a valid git command, and what does \"corrects and retains both versions\" mean?

Please provide an actual trascript of the problem, rather than the unclear description.
