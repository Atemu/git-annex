I tried to do `git annex config --set annex.tune.objecthashlower true` just after doing `git annex init` but after some other commands I got this error when trying to do `git annex sync` (I'm using git-annex v6):
```
git-annex: Remote repository is tuned in incompatible way; cannot be merged with local repository.
```
So I guess there is way to have this behavior in normal repos, but again I don't see why since it's even possible on crippled filesystems.
