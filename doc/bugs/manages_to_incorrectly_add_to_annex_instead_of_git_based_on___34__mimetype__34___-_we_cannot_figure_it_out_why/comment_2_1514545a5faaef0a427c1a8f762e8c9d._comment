Hi Joey, thanks for the quick reply. After I filed an issue I did realize as well that it must be difference in libmagic1 library version and change in its behavior (!) and indeed it is the case here:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$> apt-cache policy libmagic1                                                                           
libmagic1:
  Installed: 1:5.30-1+deb9u2
  Candidate: 1:5.30-1+deb9u2
  Version table:
 *** 1:5.30-1+deb9u2 100
        100 http://debian.csail.mit.edu/debian stretch/main amd64 Packages
        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
     1:5.30-1+deb9u1 100

$> file -L --mime BADFILE.txt                                                                           
BADFILE.txt: text/plain; charset=utf-8

$> LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/git-annex.linux/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmagic.so.1 file -L --mime BADFILE.txt
file: compiled magic version [530] does not match with shared library magic version [535]
BADFILE.txt: application/json; charset=utf-8

\"\"\"]]

Standalone I believe was built on buster. 
I am not sure how I didn't run into this change of behavior before!

Possibly interesting observation: making it a not kosher json (adding trailing , into one field etc) makes it being detected as text again

But altogether, with this new behavior of libmagic, it begs a new question:

**how (without listing all possible text based file formats) we could instruct annex to treat them as text files?**

There is an `-e` option to `file` to exclude some tests, and I thought excluding `apptype` would help, but it does not
[[!format sh \"\"\"
  -e, --exclude TEST         exclude TEST from the list of test to be
                               performed for file. Valid tests are:
                               apptype, ascii, cdf, compress, elf, encoding,
                               soft, tar, json, text, tokens

$> file  -e apptype --mime BADFILE.txt    
BADFILE.txt: application/json; charset=utf-8
\"\"\"]]

There is also `-k, --keep-going           don't stop at the first match` so I thought it might list some `text/` but I am not sure what it does:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$> file -k --mime BADFILE.txt
BADFILE.txt: application/json\012- \012- ; charset=utf-8

$> python -c 'import magic; m=magic.Magic(mime=True, keep_going=True); print(m.from_file(\"BADFILE.txt\"))'
application/json\012- \012-
\"\"\"]]

but this might be just a bug in libmagic...?
