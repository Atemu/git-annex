Well, I did not check reflink=auto. I just checked first with `git annex copy --to=cache` which simply duplicated every file. So there are two posibilities:

1. reflink=auto doesn't work (I did not check but I think it work)
2. git-annex does not recognise the other path to be on the same filesystem so went back to simply copy (very likely but joey has to check.)
