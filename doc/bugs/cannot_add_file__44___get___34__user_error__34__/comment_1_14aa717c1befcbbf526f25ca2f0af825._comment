What version of OSX is this? From what url did you download the dmg? 

Have you run \"runshell\" to get the shell you're using git-annex in?

What happens if you run sha512sum on the file yourself?

The SHA512 backend is not the default backend used by git-annex. Is the default SHA256 backend working?
