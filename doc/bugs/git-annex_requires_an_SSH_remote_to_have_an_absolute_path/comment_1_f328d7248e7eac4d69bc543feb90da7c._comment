I use home-relative paths in ssh remotes with git-annex all the time.
It works fine.

Seems to me that this, as well as your other bug report about using
[git-annex-shell in a very strange way](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/git-annex-shell_-c_git-annex-shell_doesn__39__t_work__44___while_git-annex_expects_it_to/), suggest that you are doing something
strange that you need to go into detail about in order for this to be a
useful bug report.
