1) Delete the incorrect remote and any local branches it has created
2) Revert branches to commits before the sync (including the git-annex branch)
3) Delete .git/annex/index (safe to do so, git-annex will rebuild it)
4) Make sure .git/annex/journal is empty

It's been a while since I've needed to do this, but I think that covers everything needed. I'm in the IRC channel (GMT/BST waking hours) if you need any further help!
