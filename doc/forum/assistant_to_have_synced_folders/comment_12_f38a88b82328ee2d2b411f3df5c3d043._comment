Looking through your video, I think I have found at least one issue with the assistant. I logged in a todo here: <http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/assistant_should_detect_added_remotes/>. It looks like assistant is not detecting your newly added remote (after hitting the combine button) which is why it wasn't syncing.
