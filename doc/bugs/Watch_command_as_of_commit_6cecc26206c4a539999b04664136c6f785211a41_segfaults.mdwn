After fixing a few things - see [[bugs/the tip at commit 6cecc26206c4a539999b04664136c6f785211a41 disables the watch command on OSX]], [[bugs/Missing dependancy in commit 6cecc26206c4a539999b04664136c6f785211a41]] and [[bugs/Fix for opening a browser on a mac (or xdg-open on linux/bsd?)]] I tried the watch command on my ~180gig annex of stuff. This might be yet again related to the issue of [[bugs/Issue on OSX with some system limits]]

the watch command segfaults

x00:annex jtang$ git annex watch --foreground -d

The above was done on the usual OSX 10.7 system that I have.

I'll try and bisect it and find out where the problem first appeared, does the tests currently test the watch command? (also my comments seem to get moderated whether i use my openid account with google or with the native ikiwiki account, so some comments might be hidden)
