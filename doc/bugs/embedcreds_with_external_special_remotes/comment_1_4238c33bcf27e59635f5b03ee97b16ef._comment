[[!commit e63dcbf36c3dd19525641ce5fc3fa797243d07a5]] fixed a similar
reversion in other special remotes, but did not touch the external special
remote.

But, I think that commit may have also fixed this in passing,
because it also changes `setRemoteCredPair'`, which
is what external is using, and the change IIRC fixed another bug
that caused it to never embed creds.

Your version predates that fix, so please try a newer version.
