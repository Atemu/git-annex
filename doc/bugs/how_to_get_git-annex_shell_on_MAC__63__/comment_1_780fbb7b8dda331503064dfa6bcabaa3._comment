Here's how I do it:

<pre>
$ oberon:tmp joeyh$ hdiutil attach git-annex.dmg
$ oberon:tmp joeyh$  /Volumes/git-annex/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex version
git-annex version: 5.20140516-g693a6a4
oberon:tmp joeyh$ PATH=$PATH:/Volumes/git-annex/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/
oberon:tmp joeyh$ git-annex version
git-annex version: 5.20140516-g693a6a4
</pre>

So, adding to PATH works fine. Perhaps you added the wrong directory to your PATH.

Note that .bash_profile is only used for bash login shells. It may not be run when you open a terminal, or when git-annex ssh's in from elsewhere to run git-annex-shell (which you seem to be asking about, but only in the title of this page?).

In particular, bash does not provide any way to set the PATH which works when you run \"ssh yourcomputer git-annex-shell\". So you will need to instead move the git-annex files into a directory that is in the default PATH.
