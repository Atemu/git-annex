So your web server is behaving differently when the user-agent contains "git"
than when it does not.

I don't think that git-annex can possibly talk to the git-http-backend
successfully, since that is only going to support whatever subset of the
http protocol that git smart http needs, and probably does not serve up the
annexed files at all. When I force the user agent to not contain "git", it works.

(It does look like git-annex init did not pass a user-agent when getting
the config file, but with git-annex head I've verified it does pass it.)

That leaves only the difference between http://datasets-dev.datalad.org/labs/haxby/raiders/
and http://datasets-dev.datalad.org/labs/haxby/raiders/.git/  
Now, with dumb http the first url would not work; git does not probe for
$url/.git or $url.git when cloning over dumb http.

I'm not clear if somehing in your rewriting made that url work, or if
git-http-backend finds the repository.
