Joey, thanks for clearing that up. In my test-case I only had two
branches, and I mistook it for pushing everything. Actually, what I
wanted to achieve was the following:

Have a main repo M with branches A and A-downstream, and have a
downstream repo D with just A-downstream. What confused me was that
the main repo always pushed A to D. I suppose if I just have the two
branches, I would achieve the desired effect by not using «annex
sync», and instead just pushing the git-annex branch manually; would
that be the way to go?
