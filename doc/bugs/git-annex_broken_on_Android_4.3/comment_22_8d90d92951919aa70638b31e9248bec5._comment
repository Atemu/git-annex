Same linking issue for both.

I don't *think* it should make any difference at all, but to spare myself a little bit of typing on this soft keyboard, I'm using a small variation on your script; I'm sharing it so other testers can use it, too, and so someone can point out if I'm doing something wrong:

    D=/data/data/ga/androidterm/tmp/gatest
    cp <file> $D
    chmod +x $D
    $D
