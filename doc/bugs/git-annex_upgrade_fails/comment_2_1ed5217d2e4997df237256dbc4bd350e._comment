I reproduced the problem using git 2.1.4. The error message was slightly
better:

	$ git annex upgrade
	upgrade (v5 to v6...) (scanning for unlocked files...)
	(v6 to v7...) ok
	(recording state in git...)
	fatal: Out of memory? mmap failed: Cannot allocate memory
	
	git status will show some files to be modified, since content availability has changed and git-annex was unable to update the index. This is only a cosmetic problem affecting git status; git add, git commit, etc won't be affected. To fix the git status display, you can run: git update-index -q --refresh <file>
	$ git status
	fatal: Out of memory? mmap failed: Cannot allocate memory

And with the newer git, resuming the failed upgrade did succeed:

	$ git status
	On branch adjusted/master(unlocked)
	nothing to commit, working tree clean
	$ git annex upgrade
	upgrade ok
