The assistant runs a daily sanity checker job which will clean up files like these. (`git annex watch` does not, however).

I think the main reason add could fail is if a file gets modified while it's in the process of being added. It could retry right away, although it needs to do it in a way that does not loop if the file continually fails to be added.
