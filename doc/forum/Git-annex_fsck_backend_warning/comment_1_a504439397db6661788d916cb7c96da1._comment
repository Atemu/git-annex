I see these false positive warnings too.  This is enough to trigger
the issue on my end:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
cd \"$(mktemp -d --tmpdir gx-XXXXXXX)\"
git init
git annex init
>foo.txt
git annex add foo.txt
git annex fsck foo.txt
\"\"\"]]

```
[...]
fsck foo.txt (checksum...) 
  foo.txt: Can be upgraded to an improved key format. You can do so by running: git annex migrate --backend=SHA256E foo.txt
ok
```

The presence of the warning bisects to 09df58c4e (handle keys with
extensions consistently in all locales, 2020-02-20), which was a part
of the 8.20200226 release.
