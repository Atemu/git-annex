Two test failures on windows in the import/export tests. The tests fail on
a v7 adjusted unlocked branch, but pass a direct mode. It may be that
there's a problem with the tests outside of windows on an adjusted branch.

The first test fails to export all annexed files to a directory special
remote.

	export foo sha1foo failed

No indication of why it failed.

The second test fails in an import. It gets as far as updating foo/master,
but then when it tries to merge that branch, there's a merge conflict.
That merge conflict seems very likely due to being on an adjusted branch;
foo/master will have the non-adjusted version of the file and merging it
into a branch where it's been adjusted does sound like there could be a
legitimate merge conflict.

If so, note that the git-annex-import man page suggests doing just such a
merge, so perhaps the docs will need to be updated, if some git-annex
command is instead used to do the merge. --[[Joey]]
