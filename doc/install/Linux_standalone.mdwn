If your Linux distribution does not have git-annex packaged up for you,
you can either build it [[fromscratch]], or you can use a handy
prebuilt tarball.

This tarball should work on most Linux systems. It does not depend
on anything except for glibc.

Warning: This is a last resort. Most Linux users should instead
[[install]] git-annex from their distribution of choice.
