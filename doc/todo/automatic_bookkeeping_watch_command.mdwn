A "git annex watch" command would help make git-annex usable by users who
don't know how to use git, or don't want to bother typing the git commands. 
It would run, in the background, watching via inotify for changes, and
automatically annexing new files, etc.

The blue sky goal would be something automated like dropbox, except fully
distributed. All files put into the repository would propagate out
to all the other clones of it, as network links allow. Note that while
dropbox allows modifying files, git-annex freezes them upon creation,
so this would not be 100% equivalent to dropbox. --[[Joey]]

This is a big project with its own [[design pages|design/assistant]].
