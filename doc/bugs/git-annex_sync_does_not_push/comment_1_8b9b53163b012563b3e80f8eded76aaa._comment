git-annex sync only syncs with remotes that have an annex.uuid configured. So you can solve your problem by: `git annex sync origin`, which will sync to the remote and incidentially initialize it for git-annex use.

I think this is merely a documentation problem, as the documentation says it syncs with all remotes. Although I don't have any strong feelings about whether sync should act on remotes that have not yet been initialized with git-annex.
