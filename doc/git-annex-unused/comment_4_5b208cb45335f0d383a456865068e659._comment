I recently migrated an annex to SHA256 (without \"E\") and I'm now trying to clean the repo from unused data.
I have a strange situation: there are 62G of unused objects:

    $ du -ks .git/annex/objects/
    64334024	.git/annex/objects/

but 'git annex unused' gives me only:

    $ git annex unused
    unused ...
    Some annexed data is no longer used by any files:
    NUMBER  KEY
    1       SHA256E-s27--32efec98dc9e05442fc2385bb85d855a8c7824c68abd4ab5bf55a4dfe412b334.pdf
    (To see where data was previously used, try: git log --stat --no-textconv -S'KEY')
    To remove unwanted data: git-annex dropunused NUMBER
    ok

I've checked (through a small shell script) that none of the object is in fact referenced by any symlink...

May I delete them? Shall I do some other checking/fscking/repairing?

Thank you
