Seems to have a scalability problem, what happens when such a repository becomes full?

Another way to accomplish I think the same thing is to pick the repositories that you would include in such a set, and make all other repositories untrusted. And set numcopies as desired. Then git-annex will never remove files from the set of non-untrusted repositories, and fsck will warn if a file is present on only an untrusted repository.
