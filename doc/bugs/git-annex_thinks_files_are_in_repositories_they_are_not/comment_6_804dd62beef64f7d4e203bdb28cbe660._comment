I am running the webapp, and thought that changes get made immediately?
Especially, these are files that I never manually commit/add/anything, and are not modified after creation even.

Specifically, in my previous comment, files New1 and New1.txt are (to my eyes) created and treated identically, yet `git annex whereis` gives different results.
