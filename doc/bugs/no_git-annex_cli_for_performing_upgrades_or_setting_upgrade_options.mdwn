### Please describe the problem.

I have to run the webapp to do upgrades...it would be nice to have a CLI.  I would hate for the CLI to be less featured than the webapp.  Unless I've missed it in the man page?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

> The CLI for performing upgrades is:
> 
>	wget http://url/file
>	$unpack file
> 
> Where on linux $unpack is "tar xf" and on OSX it's something with hduutil
> attach dmg.
>
> Or, even better, it's `apt-get upgrade; apt-get install git-annex` or the
> fine equivilant provided by your fine OS.
> 
> Command-line programs do not typically provide upgrade commands, 
> because this is up to the OS, or easily handled with other command-line
> programs. I see no reason for git-annex to be different, so [[done]]
