Unfortunately, chroot approach does not work either. While git-annex works fine when I'm in the chroot, it doesn't work any more outside. If I don't copy libc, I get a version error (just like before so this is normal):

    git-annex: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.7' not found (required by /opt/share/git-annex/bin/git-annex)
    git-annex: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.6' not found (required by /opt/share/git-annex/bin/git-annex)
    git-annex: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.7' not found (required by /opt/share/git-annex/lib/libgmp.so.10)

When I copy libc from the Debian chroot, then, it complains about libpthread:

    git-annex: relocation error: /lib/libpthread.so.0: symbol __default_rt_sa_restorer, version GLIBC_PRIVATE not defined in file libc.so.6 with link time reference

If then I copy libpthread also, I get:

    Illegal instruction (core dumped)

So, I'm stuck...  :-(
I'll try to find a way using the version in the chroot instead of trying to export it to the host system...
