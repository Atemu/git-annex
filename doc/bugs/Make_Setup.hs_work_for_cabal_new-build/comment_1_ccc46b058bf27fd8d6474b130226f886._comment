stack install also bypasses the custom postCopy. It's not been much of a
problem. git-annex's Makefile can use either system to build, and does a
much better job of installing all needed files.

I've updated the install/fromsource page to point the user toward
`make install` more. Also added a `make install-home` target.

But I've kept support for using cabal install because users may be relying
on that installation method. If cabal switches to new-build by default
and it stops working, it can be removed then.
