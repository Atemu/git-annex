I'm glad this wasn't a bug!

I'm not really sold on its current behavior WRT archive directories and backups.  It seemed to make sense at the time..

Nor am I entirely thrilled with the current hardcoded \"(copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)\" that makes any given file be stored in only 1 archive repository. `numcopies` doesn't seem quite the right thing to put in place of that `1
