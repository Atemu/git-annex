   * Webapp: When adding a new box.com remote, use the new style chunking.
     Thanks, Jon Ander Pe√±alba.
   * External special remote protocol now includes commands for setting
     and getting the urls associated with a key.
   * Urls can now be claimed by remotes. This will allow creating,
     for example, a external special remote that handles magnet: and
     *.torrent urls.
   * Use wget -q --show-progress for less verbose wget output,
     when built with wget 1.16.
   * Added bittorrent special remote.
   * addurl behavior change: When downloading an url ending in .torrent,
     it will download files from bittorrent, instead of the old behavior
     of adding the torrent file to the repository.
   * Added Recommends on aria2.
   * When possible, build with the haskell torrent library for parsing
     torrent files. As a fallback, can instead use btshowmetainfo from
     bittornado | bittorrent.
   * Fix build with -f-S3."""]]
