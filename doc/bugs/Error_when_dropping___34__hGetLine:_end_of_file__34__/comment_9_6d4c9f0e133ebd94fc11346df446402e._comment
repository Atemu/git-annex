Yes, running git-attr like that does indeed produce the problem.  I attempted to rebuild git-annex using cabal, but the build failed with the following error:

    [273 of 290] Compiling Assistant.WebApp.Configurators.Local ( Assistant/WebApp/Configurators/Local.hs, dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Assistant/WebApp/Configurators/Local.o )
    
    Assistant/WebApp/Configurators/Local.hs:55:11:
        `fieldEnctype' is not a (visible) field of constructor `Field'
    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
