I don't know what the financial costs of the API calls work out to,
but it's true that setting a remote to a higher annex-cost makes git-annex
avoid using it when possible. And also true that trusting a remote will
avoid git-annex making API calls to verify that it still contains content.

Bear in mind that trusting a repo can easily lead to data loss in
situations where you remove content from it, which is
documented in [[git-annex-trust]]. Indeed, recently git-annex has
started warning about this when you try to trust a remote. If you are sure
you'll never remove content from the remote, or will only ever access this
remore from a single repository, you might be able to convince yourself
you'll avoid situations where trusting it would lose data.
