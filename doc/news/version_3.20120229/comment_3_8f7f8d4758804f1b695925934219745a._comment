Unfortunately, the patch you mentioned doesn't seem to address the problem. I'm getting the following compile error:

    Data/Digest/SHA2.hs:111:4:
        Could not deduce (Show a) arising from a use of `showHex'
        from the context (Integral a)
          bound by the instance declaration at Data/Digest/SHA2.hs:109:10-39
        Possible fix:
          add (Show a) to the context of the instance declaration
        In the first argument of `(.)', namely `(showHex a)'
        In the expression:
          (showHex a)
          . (' ' :)
            . (showHex b)
              . (' ' :)
                . (showHex c)
                  . (' ' :)
                    . (showHex d)
                      . (' ' :)
                        . (showHex e)
                          . (' ' :)
                            . (showHex f) . (' ' :) . (showHex g) . (' ' :) . (showHex h)
        In an equation for `showsPrec':
            showsPrec _ (Hash8 a b c d e f g h)
              = (showHex a)
                . (' ' :)
                  . (showHex b)
                    . (' ' :)
                      . (showHex c)
                        . (' ' :)
                          . (showHex d)
                            . (' ' :)
                              . (showHex e)
                                . (' ' :)
                                  . (showHex f) . (' ' :) . (showHex g) . (' ' :) . (showHex h)
