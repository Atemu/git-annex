Haskell Platform is now [officially available for openSUSE](http://software.opensuse.org/package/haskell-platform) via 1-Click Install. 

At the time of writing, there are [unofficial packages of git-annex](http://software.opensuse.org/package/git-annex) available for openSUSE.  It should also be possible to build it via cabal or from source as described on the [[install]] page.
