You can work around the ControlPath too long by running in your git repo:

git config annex.sshcaching false

While I could reproduce that part of your problem, I did *not* see any data actually be transferred when the ControlPath was too long. For example:

<pre>
joey@gnu:~/tmp/t/1>git annex transferkey --to foo SHA256E-s29--66ffceb8b7a1af9c2eb896f26fb8f3bdab0a606da59a7a2d71ae4f7d78ad13c4/SHA256E-s29--66ffceb8b7a1af9c2eb896f26fb8f3bdab0a606da59a7a2d71ae4f7d78ad13c4

ControlPath too long
rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(605) [sender=3.0.9]

  rsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer

git-annex: transferkey: 1 failed
</pre>
