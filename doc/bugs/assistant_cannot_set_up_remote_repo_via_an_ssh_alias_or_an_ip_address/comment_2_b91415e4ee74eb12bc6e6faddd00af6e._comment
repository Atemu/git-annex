I'm running into this problem too. I need to use an ssh alias because machines behind pagekite have to be accessed using an HTTP connect proxy, which is done with the ProxyCommand option in the ssh config file. I'm mentioning this because IMHO it's much less of a power user problem than you seem to think.

In fact, I'd argue that a power user is more likely to have access to a machine with a fixed IP address or FQDN. It is people which fall more into the \"mere mortal\" side of the spectrum that need to resort to ssh aliases to access machines behind NAT or dynamic IPs. :-)

All that to say that it would be nice if this usecase was explicitly supported in the UI (maybe a checkbox saying \"this is an ssh alias\", or a textfield to enter a proxy through which the connection has to be routed).
