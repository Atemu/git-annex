Sorry `largefiles` already sort of does this. My main hang up might just be the name, it's not intuitive what all side effects it'll have. Having it called something explicit like `addtoannex` will probably make it super clear to me.

Also what is the current default value of `annex.gitaddtoannex`? And how does this interact with largefiles as it is now?
