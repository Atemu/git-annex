I don't know if git-annex is the right vehicle to fix this. It seems that a more generic fix that would work in non-git-annex repos would be better.

I can answer your question though: The metadata such as urls and locations that git-annex stores in the git-annex branch is attached to objects, and not to work tree paths.
