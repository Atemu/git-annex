They are both \"backup\" not \"archive.\"  I had thought that backups pretty much counted as archives, but I guess this new behavior requires actual *archive* directories to do its job.

Not sure what would be the best way to achieve my goals now, which are \"the usb and ssh remote want everything, the client wants to get rid of what's in archive directories if it's backed up in two backup directories.\"

I can probably write a custom preferred content expression to do the job (I could copy the existing \"client\" one and replace \"archive\" with \"backup\" for example), but if there's a good way to do it with standard expressions I'd be curious to know.

Thanks for the explanation!
