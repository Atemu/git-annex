cabal install yesod didn't work, needed --force-reinstalls, then went through - but still the same error then on installing git-annex. Since afterwards my cabal stuff seemed to be wacky and since you wrote you got the mac app fully working, I just nuked my cabal stuff and used your install. Worked so far, but since I am eager for the direct repo stuff I switched my repo to direct mode. But now I get this on sync and - which is in this case a bit worse, since I can't switch back - indirect:

    [gb@Flunder Annex (master)]$ annex indirect
