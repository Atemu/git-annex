I suppose one other thing I can add is that even within a command this is patchy. For instance in this commit of 16 files, 8 of them have this issue.

I can only assume there is some race condition in windows causing the process problem (but I don't want to assume too much).

I hope that helps, and I'm curious if anyone else has seen this.
