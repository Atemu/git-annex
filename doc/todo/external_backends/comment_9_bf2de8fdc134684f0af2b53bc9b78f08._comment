Seems that this has a naming problem. Each backend needs a unique name. The
length of the name has to be short enough to not make the key length
excessive. The longest backend name in git-annex is "BLAKE2SP256E" (12).
A UUID seems too long, domain name probably too long.

If two external backends picked the same name and the wrong one
got installed, bad things could happen, like failing to verify content
because it used an unexpected hash.

Maybe just have a name registry on this site, first come first served and
if you chose to overlap, you get to keep all 100 pieces?

(Note that external special remote programs must have unique names too,
which does not seem to have been a problem in practice.)
