git-annex 6.20160418 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * smudge: Print a warning when annex.thin is set, as git's smudge
     interface does not allow honoring that configuration.
   * webapp: When $HOME is a git repository, and has been initialized for
     use by git-annex, opening the webapp went ahead and ran the assistant
     there, annexing all files. Since this is almost certianly not
     desirable, especially when the user is just opening the webapp from
     a dekstop menu which happens to run it in $HOME, the webapp will now not
     treat such a $HOME git repository as a git-annex repository.
   * webapp: Update url to add gitlab.com ssh key.
   * Fix bug in v6 mode that prevented treating unlocked executable files
     as annexed. If you have such files, run git annex init --version=6
     to update the cache after upgrading to this version of git-annex.
   * Preserve execute bits of unlocked files in v6 mode.
   * fsck: Warn when core.sharedRepository is set and an annex object file's
     write bit is not set and cannot be set due to the file being owned
     by a different user.
   * Fix hang when dropping content needs to lock the content on a
     ssh remote, which occurred when the remote has git-annex version
     5.20151019 or newer. (The bug was in the client side; the remote
     git-annex-shell does not need to be upgraded.)"""]]
