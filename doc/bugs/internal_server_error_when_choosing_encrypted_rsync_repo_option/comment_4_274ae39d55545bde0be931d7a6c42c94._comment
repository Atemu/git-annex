The question is, where did this line in .gnupg/gpg.conf come from?

It seems likely to me that something else put it there, and perhaps that has a version of gpg that supports some of the options, like ldap, while the version of gpg bundled with git-annex for OSX Lion does not.

(I tried enabling that line on a Mountian Lion machine, and the gpg in git-annex accepts it.)
