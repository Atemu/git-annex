Results from Windows autobuilder with the 0% test being the first test ran:
That test succeeded, and then the 33% test failed. So apparently the first
retrieveKeyFile is setting up a situation where the second one fails.

Meanwhile, on Linux, I have verified that there is no leaking file handle
by retrieveKeyFile. Which doesn't mean there isn't on windows, but if there
is, it's a ghc bug or a Windows bug and not a bug I can do anything about.

Also, manually testing the directory special remote, not using the test
suite, retrieveKeyFile seems to work ok, even when run multiple times.

I have disabled the remote tests on Windows.
