@john, the difference is that while addurl can make up a filename to use if
you do not provide one, rmurl needs you to specifiy a filename.

So, yes, "git annex rmurl --file=whatever url" would be more consistent,
but it requires typing more my making something that is not actually
optional into an option. And "git annex addurl file url" would make
the command more consistent with rmurl, but harder to use.

Consistency is not everything.

(Also, the rmurl batch interface would then be less consistent to its
command-line interface.)
