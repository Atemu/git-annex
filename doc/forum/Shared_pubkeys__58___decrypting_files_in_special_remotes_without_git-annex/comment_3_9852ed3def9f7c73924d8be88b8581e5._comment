Aaah. I see you have commented on the [Future proofing / disaster recovery with an encrypted special remote](http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Future_proofing___47___disaster_recovery_with_an_encrypted_special_remote/) as well. I'll try to test with `sharedpubkey` if I get a chance.

Have you tried looking at the generated cipher? `git show git-annex:remote.log | grep 'name='\"your-remote-name \"`? Did you try adding `IFS= read -rd '' cipher < <( printf \"$cipher\n\" )`?
