Nice job debugging.

runshell sets `GCONV_PATH` to a copy of the gconv directory that is
included in the standalone bundle. The bundle does not include a copy
of /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive, and looking at the glibc source,
even if I included one, it's hard-coded to use that path for the file.

Hmm, it looks like setting LOCPATH to anything will prevent glibc from
trying to use the locale-archive file. (Normally it is /usr/lib/locale/)

Or, it could force LANG=C, or unset LANG, which in my tests, both
prevent any locale files being opened at all.

Your NAS seems to have a default locale, in the interactive shell,
of "en_US.utf8", which  I guess is not being propigated via ssh's
SendEnv from the host you  ssh in from, since that host has a
different "en_US.UTF-8". I wonder what the locale is set to when sshing
into the NAS noninteractively? Ie, output of "ssh $nas locale"
