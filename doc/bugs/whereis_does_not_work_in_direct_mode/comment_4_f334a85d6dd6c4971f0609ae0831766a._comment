Talking about the three possible causes for this bug,

> 1) pc1 has not pushed git-annex branch to origin (or pushed it after pc2 pulled)

pc1 pushes using `git annex sync -c annex.alwayscommit=true origin`. This should be enough, isn't it?

> 2) pc2 has not fetched git-annex branch from origin

The pc2 repository is created with `git clone localhost:/tmp/annex/Docs.git`, so there branches should all be there. I tried adding a `git fetch --all` to the script but it makes no difference. This is the list of branches in pc2:

    * master
      remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
      remotes/origin/master
      remotes/origin/synced/git-annex
      remotes/origin/synced/master
