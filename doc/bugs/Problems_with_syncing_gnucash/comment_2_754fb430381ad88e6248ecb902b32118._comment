I was able to reproduce this with gnucash, and came up with a small test case:

[[!format perl \"\"\"
my $foo=\"foo\";
open(OUT, \">$foo.new\");
link(\"$foo.new\", \"$foo\");
unlink(\"$foo.new\");
close OUT;
\"\"\"]]

This defeats the watcher, which sees the file be opened for write, and then deleted before it's closed. To fix this it would need to correlate the hard link with the original file, to know that when the original file is closed, the hard link can now be safely added to the annex.

The daily sanity checker will find and eventually add these files, or the assistant will see them the next time it's started.
