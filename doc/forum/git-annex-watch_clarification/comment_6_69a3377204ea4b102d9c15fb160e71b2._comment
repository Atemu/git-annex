\"except for if something has it open for write beforehand\" -- maybe, `git-annex-add` could do a pre-pass where it finds all files to be added, chmods them to read-only to stop new open-for-write attempts, then runs lsof once to find any existing ones?  The files could be hardlinked into one temp dir then chmod and lsof run on that dir.
