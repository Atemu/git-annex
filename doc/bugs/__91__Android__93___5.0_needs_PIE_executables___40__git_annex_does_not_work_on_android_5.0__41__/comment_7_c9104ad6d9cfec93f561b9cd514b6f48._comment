I verified with `eu-readelf --file-header` that the git-annex binary is DYN; ie linked PIE.

It might be that I also need to tell the C compiler to build it with PIE options. I have now updated the build to include that. Please test the new build.

It occurs to me that the problem might be not git-annex, but one of the other binaries, like busybox. Does the android app install to the point that there is a working terminal app with a shell?

It also seems possible that the entire haskell library stack might need to be built with PIE options. If so, that will be a massive pain; I'd need an entire separate autobuilder instance.
