I have a [proof of concept written in python](https://github.com/JustinAzoff/git-annex-background-fsck/blob/master/git-annex-background-fsck).

You can run it and point it the root of an annex or to a subdirectory.  In my brief testing it seems to work :-)

the goal would be to have options like

    git annex fsck /data/annex --check-older-than 1w --check-for 2h --max-load-avg 0.5
