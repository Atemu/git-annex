I shut down the daemon that was running from the webapp itself.

Instead of launching by using the app, I did:

[[!format txt \"\"\"
celestia:~ rachel$ cd annex/
celestia:annex rachel$ git-annex assistant
(merging synced/git-annex into git-annex...)
celestia:annex rachel$ git-annex webapp
Launching web browser on file:///Users/rachel/annex/.git/annex/webapp.html
celestia:annex rachel$ 
\"\"\"]]

It opened the webapp. I could see all the repos back again.

It also seems to be syncing to everything else, sending the files all over again, even though they haven't changed.

It's just about possible it's completing the job, as I'm not sure I saw the files syncing now, being synced earlier. But... in that earlier session it had run the queue dry, *it* thought it had completed syncing.

What's going on?
