just a suggestion (yet to comprehend full idea here):  might be worth making it less magical, e.g. expanding \"add\" with two options:

-u (similar to git) would check only known to git files
-a would also automatically add new files

So I could just \"git annex add -au .\" to commit all the changes in files which happened to be created or modified, without penalty of checksumming all the files.
