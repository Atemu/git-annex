There is no change at all for performance when annexed files are symlinks.

If the annexed file is unlocked, it will use smudge/clean filters.

If you have non-annexed files in the git repo, git will also run those
through the smudge/clean filters.

git calls the clean filter when it sees a file has been modified.
Things like git status and git add. It caches the result until the file is
modified again. The smudge filter is only called when git is checking out
a file (git checkout or a change from a git pull etc).
