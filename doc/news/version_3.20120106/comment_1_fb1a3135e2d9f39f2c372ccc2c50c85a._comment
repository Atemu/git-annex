We have the [latest version in NixOS](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nixpkgs/trunk/gitAndTools.gitAnnex), but we cannot advertise that fact on Hackage because it seems the corresponding Cabal file hasn't been uploaded to <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/git-annex>. Is there any particular reason why Hackage doesn't know about this release?
