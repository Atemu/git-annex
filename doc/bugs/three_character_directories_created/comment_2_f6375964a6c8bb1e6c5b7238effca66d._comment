It just happened again to me, on another computer:

<pre>
    % git annex sync
    (merging synced/git-annex into git-annex...)
    commit  
    add PATH/FILE (checksum...) ok
    ok
    add PATH/SUBPATH/FILE (checksum...) ok
    ok
    (Recording state in git...)
    [master 93c4526] git-annex automatic sync
    2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
    ok
    merge synced/master 
    CONFLICT (modify/delete): PATH/FILE deleted in refs/heads/synced/master and modified in HEAD. Version HEAD of PATH/FILE left in tree.
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

</pre>

git status was showing all the 3 character directories and new files. I commited to git the path I actually wanted to commit, ran a git annex sync again and now my status is clean, but the directories are there. Am I doing something wrong this way?
