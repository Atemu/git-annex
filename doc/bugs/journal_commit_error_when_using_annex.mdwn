Sorry for the noise - notabug - [[done]]

Setup:

* git-annex version: 3.20120629 on Debian unstable.
* external RAID1 array connected via usb

I did: <code> git-annex add \<a specific album of ogg files\> </code>

When it gets to the fourth song, there is a long delay and a bunch of "journal commit I/O error" from the kernel start appearing. Then GNOME helpfully tells me that my drive was just connected (implying that it thought it was disconnected momentarily)

Log outputs:

Both trying to add whole album, failing at song 4

* <http://paste.mitechie.com/show/745/>
* <http://paste.mitechie.com/show/746/>

Just trying to add song 4 individually

* <http://paste.mitechie.com/show/747/> (lots o' journal commit I/O errors that time)
