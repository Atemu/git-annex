i can reproduce reliably alright. It's quite systematic. I have found the `longpolling.js` file in the inspector, but I am not very familiar with in-browser javascript debugging, so I am not sure where to go from here.

Note that the assistant doesn't actually crash. This is also reproducable in Debian sid.
