I don't think this is a bug. By default, git-annex repos on android are
configured to be in the "source" [[group|standard_groups]]. This means
that, as soon as the files have reached some other repository, they're
removed from the Android device. Which saves space.

If you don't want this behavior, click on Edit for the android repositry
in the webapp, and change to some other group, like "client".
