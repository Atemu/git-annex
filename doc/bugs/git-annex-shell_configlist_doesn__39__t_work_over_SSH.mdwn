### Please describe the problem.
git-annex-shell -c configlist /home/annex/test2.git, when ran via sudo (login shell or otherwise), works fine. When executed equivalently over SSH, this error is given:
[[!format sh """
git-annex-shell: failed to read git config of git repository in unknown on /home/annex/test2.git; perhaps this repository is not set up correctly or has moved
"""]]

(note: I am using a workaround necessary due to another bug with git-annex-shell, I will also post that bug)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
See the transcript.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
6.20180529 on NixOS.

### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes.
