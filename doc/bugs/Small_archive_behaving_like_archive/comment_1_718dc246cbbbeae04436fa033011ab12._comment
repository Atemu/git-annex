I have tested smallarchive and do not see any bug with its operation. Files not in an `archive` directory are not sent to the smallarchive repository. Files in `archive` directories are, unless they have already been sent to some other archive repository.

There has, however, been a recent change that could have led you to see a change in behavior, though not one that is really a bug:
Now smallarchive repositories will accept any content if it's only located on repositories that are untrusted or dead. So for example if your main client repo is for some reason marked as untrusted, the glacier repo would assume it's going away, and accept content from it.

If that's not the explanation, you will need to provide more details..
