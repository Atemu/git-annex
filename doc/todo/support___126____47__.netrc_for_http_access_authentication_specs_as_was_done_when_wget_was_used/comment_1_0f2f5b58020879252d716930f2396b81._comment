.netrc was considered in [[stop_using_curl_and_wget]]. The changelog for
the release recommends that users who need a netrc do "git config
annex.web-options --netrc"

I don't anticipate adding support for netrc files to git-annex.
Adding a dependency on http://hackage.haskell.org/package/netrc for such a
relatively little-used feature which can be supported as above does not
seem worth it.
