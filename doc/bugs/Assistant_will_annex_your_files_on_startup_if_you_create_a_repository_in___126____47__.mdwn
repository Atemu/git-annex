### Please describe the problem.

If I create a git annex repository in my home directory, then start the assistant, the assistant will try to annex my entire home dir.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

$ cd
$ git init
$ git annex init

Applications Menu -> Internet -> Git Annex

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Debian Jessie git-annex (5.20141125)

### Expected behavior

The assistant shouldn't do anything unless I tell it to. Currently, I cannot play with the assistant at all, because I do not want everything in my homedir to be locked and symlinked.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I use git annex for managing the image and video resources on my website and it works fine for that.
