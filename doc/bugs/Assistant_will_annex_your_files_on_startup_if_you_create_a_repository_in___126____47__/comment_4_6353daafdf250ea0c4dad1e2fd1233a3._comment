Yes, that is the problem. Try:

````
$ mkdir foo
$ cd foo
$ echo foo > bar
$ git init
$ git annex init
$ git annex webapp
````

You'll get:

````
x Committed changes to git
× Added bar
× Performed startup scan
````

But I wouldn't expect that. Why should the command `git annex webapp` run an `add` command?
