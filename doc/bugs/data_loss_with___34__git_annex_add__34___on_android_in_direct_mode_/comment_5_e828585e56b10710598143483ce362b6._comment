I'll close the bug.

FWIW, I developed git-annex on an Android device with such an emulated filesystem for /sdcard. It's a FUSE filesystem with a terrible implementation. I found multiple syscalls that just failed, and was careful to avoid using them.

Personally, the benefits of non-crippled filesystem do not seem worth the bother of doing what you're doing..
