I tested this version of git-annex on Android 4.0, doing both an upgrade and a fresh install. In both cases, sha256sum and the other busybox links were set up ok.

At this point this looks to be either specific to your version of Android, or some problem that botched the install.
Please follow-up with the requested information. Also, try removing and reinstalling git-annex from scratch.
