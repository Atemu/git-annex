This shouldn't be under bugs, it is the intended behaviour.

Both the words `import` and `reinject` relate to the movement of something from one place to another (importing goods, injecting fluids). Descriptions for both these commands state that data will be *moved* into the annex in the first sentence. If you aren't reading docs before using these commands, better docs are hardly going to have helped..

What you are trying to do can be done with `import --skip-duplicates` then `cp` -> `reinject`, albeit a bit of a pain. Personally, I would use `calckey` to generate the hashes (and keep them in a file), add hashes for files not listed in that file, then use that file to find out what keys were unknown and `import --duplicate` just those files.

..or [following a suggestion I made a while ago](http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/Alternative_mode_control_for_import/) `git annex import --mode=Di,Nsi` would do what you want (injects duplicates without deleting, adds new without deleting) :P
