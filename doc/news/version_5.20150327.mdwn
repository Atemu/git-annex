git-annex 5.20150327 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * readpresentkey: New plumbing command for checking location log.
   * checkpresentkey: New plumbing command to check if a key can be verified
     to be present on a remote.
   * Added a post-update-annex hook, which is run after the git-annex branch
     is updated. Needed for git update-server-info.
   * migrate: --force will force migration of keys already using the
     destination backend. Useful in rare cases.
   * Man pages for individual commands now available, and can be
     opened using "git annex help &lt;command&gt;"
   * --auto is no longer a global option; only get, drop, and copy
     accept it. (Not a behavior change unless you were passing it to a
     command that ignored it.)
   * Improve error message when --in @date is used and there is no
     reflog for the git-annex branch.
   * assistant: Committing a whole lot of files at once could overflow
     command-line length limits and cause the commit to fail. This
     only happened when using the assistant in an indirect mode repository.
   * Work around curl bug when asked to download an empty url to a file.
   * Fix bug introduced in the last release that broke git-annex sync
     when git-annex was installed from the standalone tarball."""]]
