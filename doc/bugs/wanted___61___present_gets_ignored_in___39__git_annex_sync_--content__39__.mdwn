### Please describe the problem.

The 'present' flag in the wanted files flag for a repository is ignored when doing a `git annex sync --content`, which causes git annex to (try to) drop all files. E.g. the line 

    wanted $repoid = lackingcopies=1 or present

in `git annex vicfg` tries to drop all files if enough copies are available. `git annex drop --auto` works as expected and doesn't try to drop files.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Use 'present' in the 'wanted' option of a repo and do a `git annex sync --content`. `wanted $repouuid = present` was enough to trigger that behaviour.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version 6.20160114 on Arch Linux.


### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

This behaviour is relatively recent. Until some time ago everything worked as expected with the expression above.
