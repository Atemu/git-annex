Despite struggling with a keyboard controller that's increasingly prone to
flaking out and not registering some key presses while doubling others, I
managed to finis implementing import from versioned S3 buckets. It's quite
nice to see it download past versions of files and construct a git history.

Still enough unimplemented stuff and bugs to need to work on this for
probably one more day.

(Imagine here me stuggling for a full minute to :wq)
