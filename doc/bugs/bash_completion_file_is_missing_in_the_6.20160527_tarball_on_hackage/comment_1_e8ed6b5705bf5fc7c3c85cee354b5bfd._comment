The tarball on hackage is only there to make `cabal install git-annex` /
`stack install git-annex`
work, and that does not currently install the bash completion script.
So, it's omitted.

If you're using the tarball for some other purpose, it's never been a
complete clone of git-annex, and it's rather less of one now, as documented
in the CHANGELOG for this release. I recommend cloning from git to get
the full source tree.
