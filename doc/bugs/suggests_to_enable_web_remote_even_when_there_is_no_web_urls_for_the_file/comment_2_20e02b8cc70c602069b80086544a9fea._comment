Thanks for the analysis!
Apparently we did have some web URLs available for that key awhile back, then bucket was redone so they were marked not available.  I wonder if may be for that batch fixup I just did it \"manually\" instead of using `rmurl` which would have taken care about it.  So I guess nothing to fix ;-)
