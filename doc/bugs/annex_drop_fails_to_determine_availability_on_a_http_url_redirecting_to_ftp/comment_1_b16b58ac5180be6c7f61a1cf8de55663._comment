This only affects http to ftp redirects, because there's a special hack
in place to use curl to check if a ftp url exists.

Seems that http-conduit throws a StatusCodeException with statusCode = 302
when it is redirected to a protocol that it does not support, such as ftp.

So, it can catch that exception and fall back to curl.
