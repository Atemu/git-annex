What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create a fresh git-annex repository
2. Add a directory tree to it with about 300,000 files in it
3. wait
4. change the tree; attempt a git commit

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

git commit hangs due to the large number of loose objects created during the git annex add. If git annex had stopped to repack the git repo a few times along the way, I think this might have been avoided.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 4.20130323
local repository version: 3
default repository version: 3
supported repository versions: 3 4
upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2
