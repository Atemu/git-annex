git-annex 0.03 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Fix support for file:// remotes.
   * Add --verbose
   * Fix SIGINT handling.
   * Fix handling of files with unusual characters in their name.
   * Fixed memory leak; git-annex no longer reads the whole file list
     from git before starting, and will be much faster with large repos.
   * Fix crash on unknown symlinks.
   * Added remote.annex-scp-options and remote.annex-ssh-options.
   * The backends to use when adding different sets of files can be configured
     via gitattributes.
   * In .gitattributes, the git-annex-backend attribute can be set to the
     names of backends to use when adding different types of files.
   * Add fsck subcommand. (For now it only finds unused key contents in the
     annex.)"""]]
