I prefer keeping --batch on things that act in terms of keys and have a
simpler interface.

So, could add --batch to `git annex transferkey`. This would presumably
need to disable any process displays in order for success/failure to be
communicated in a machine-parsable way. (Actually, `git annex transferkeys`
already implements such a batch interface, but one that is currently
not documented due to only being built for the assistant to use it.)

There is already `git annex dropkey --batch`, although it does not
verify that other copies exist.
