 content="""
The sequence of commands given to shift an unlocked annexed file to normal git (for instance a file annexed by mistake due to the new git-add behaviour), namely

    git annex unlock file
    git -c annex.largefiles=nothing add file
    git commit file

does not work if the file is unmodified, as git sees no change to commit. In this case, I believe one should replace the first command with

    git annex unannex file
