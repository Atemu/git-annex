Ok, reproduced that. 

Webapp seems to be setting up the newly created repository's group and preferred content settings inside the current repository. The 2 repositories are not otherwise linked or sharing data in any way, so this the impact is limited to 2 lines that won't affect anything being committed to the git-annex branch, and to the newly created repository not defaulting to being in the client group or having the standard preferred content setting (which can easily be fixed with the webapp).
