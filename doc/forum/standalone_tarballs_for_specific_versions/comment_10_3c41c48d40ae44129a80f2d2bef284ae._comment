@joey, when you get a chance, could you add the standalone distribution for the current released version (8.20200720.1, not the bleeding-edge git) to the archive at downloads.kitenet.net?

Would it be practical to document the process for creating a standalone distro, so that it can be built on conda-forge simultaneously with the corresponding non-standalone version?

Thanks!
