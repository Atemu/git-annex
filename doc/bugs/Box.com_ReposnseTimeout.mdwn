Box.com is still not working properly in version 5.20140227 (I'm using it in Debian testing and sid).

I created a new clean repository and configured Box.com (everything from the webapp). At first it seamed to work, files where being uploaded and the logs where fine. Then I created another clean repository in another computer and started syncing. Downloading files worked properly, but when trying to upload a file from the second computer I got this:

    copy my_file (gpg) (checking box.com...) (to box.com...) 
    100%          0.0 B/s 0sResponseTimeout
    failed                  
    git-annex: copy: 1 failed

When I got back to the first computer I saw the same behavior, uploading files wasn't working any more.
