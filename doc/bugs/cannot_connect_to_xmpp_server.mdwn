I cannot get the assistant to connect to my jabber account, db48x@db48x.net. I get the message stating that it may take a minute, which is never updated. At the very least I would expect some sort of error message.

I get the same symptoms if I connect to an account @gmail.com, but type in the wrong password. If I put in the correct password, it connects quite quickly.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
