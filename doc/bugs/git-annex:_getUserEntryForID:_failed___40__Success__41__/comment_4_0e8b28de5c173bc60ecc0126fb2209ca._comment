I think you mean the environment variables with \"use USER, and HOME\"? So I checked them I they are correct.
Reading man(3) getpwent says \"from the password database (e.g., the local password file /etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP)\", so it should be no problem with the LDAP backend I'm using to log-in...
One other special thing: The home directory is on a NFS share.
