Maybe also, an option to auto-unlock the file right after commit?  E.g. based on `.gitattributes`.  Basically, unlocked files would look locally modified to `git`, but if their contents hasn't changed, the modification would just look like `typechange` from symlink to blob.  It can actually be useful to see all unlocked files this way.

This of course negates the point of v7, but [[sometimes|forum/Preserving_the_v5_experience]] the v5 model is a better fit.
