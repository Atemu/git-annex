### Please describe the problem.
The git annex init command is failed.
Following this command the created file content in .git/annex/ssh.config contains these lines

Include ~/.ssh/config
Include /etc/ssh/ssh_config
ServerAliveInterval 60

The two first Include directive seems to be invalid for openssh, then it seems the ssh command is failed and it is analysed as the remote does not git-annex-shell installed.
Commenting these first 2 lines seems to fix the issue and then  regular git-annex commands can then be issued.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
git annex init


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes sure, it's a great software !
Basically commenting the first 2 lines seems to fix the issue.
I would just like to be sure nothing else is hidden.
