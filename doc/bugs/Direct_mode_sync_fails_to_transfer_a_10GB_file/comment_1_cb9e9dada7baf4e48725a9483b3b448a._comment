In my own test, I made a 10 gb file, and the key git-annex came up with had
a size of -2147483648 which is clearly screwed up.. But that's what
getFileStatus reports the size as. This was in an 32 bit XP VM.

Hmm, unix-compat's getFileStatus calls getFileSize, which yields a
FileOffset. The maxBound of that on linux is a nice large
9223372036854775807, but on Windows, it appears to be 2147483647.

Compare with using hFileSize, which yields an Integer. So,
getFileSize and fileSize are unsafe on Windows due to FileOffset being so
small on Windows.

I have now corrected all places in git-annex that used the unsafe fileSize.
It will behave correctly on Windows now.

However, if you still have the repo with the big file, it's key still has
the wrong size. To fix, you can "git annex unannex" the file, and then "git
annex add" it back, after upgrading to the current daily build, or the next
release of git-annex.
