@purpleidea showed me his git log, and as I had expected, there were previous empty commits immediately before the 2 commits that removes all of his files (which happened independenctly on 2 different machines running the assistant). This is consistent with my suspicion it's a race. Note that the assistant's git ref watcher can easily run multiple merges concurrently if multiple refs change.
