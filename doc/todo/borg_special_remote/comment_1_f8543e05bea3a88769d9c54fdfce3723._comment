Hi Joey,

i am currently working on a remote to use borg as a tree import source and a content souce

the work is started in https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt/git-annex-borg

note that borg does **not** do delta storage - it does content informed dynamic chunk sizes (which helps deduplication)

freestanding borg will not be a good remote for putting things out,
so i will be pulling things out mostly (but i hope to hit a point where its viable to generate a borg archive from the tree of expected contents thats viable for putting things in)
