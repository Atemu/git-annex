You can find out what would be done by a get (ish), but running something like this:

    git annex find --not --in here <path>

..which will show files which are known about but aren't in this annexed copy.
I've been using this to see what needs to be 'got' to a location.

It does, however, need an annex repo to have a remote set up if you wish to check against it, as they aren't automatically bi-directional (which makes sense as firewalls and similar may not make this possible).
