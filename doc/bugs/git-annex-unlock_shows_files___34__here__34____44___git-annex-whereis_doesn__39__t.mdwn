### Please describe the problem.

``git annex unlock myfolder`` will unlock all files inside (`find myfolder -type l' returns nothing).

Yet, ``git annex whereis myfolder`` shows those files are *not* in current repo.

Meanwhile, those files also reside in a remote. git-annex-whereis does show there is a copy in that remote.

Note that dropping files in current repo (``git annex drop``) and re-getting (``git annex get``) does download the files from that remote. However, a subsequent ``git annext whereis`` again shows 1 copy --- at that remote only.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, git annex is wonderful.
