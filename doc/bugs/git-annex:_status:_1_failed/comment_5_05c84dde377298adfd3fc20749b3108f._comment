I use v4.20130909 and get the same error when running `git-annex status`. Does it matter that my filename in question is shown to have two dashes (--) at the end, just as in OP's case? Other files in .git/annex/tmp only have one dash at the end. 

Joey, I straced the command and sent the output to your kitenet e-mail address. Hope it helps.
