This is not an installation problem; the /data/app-lib message is a red herring.

Is /sdcard/mediashare a directory that already existed? If so, perhaps it's some \"mediashare\" thing that has a even more crippled filesystem than usual. Seems possible, but I don't know. Want to rule it out..

The actual failure seems to be when git tries to write to its config.lock file, and changes its permissions. This is a recent change in git, commit daa22c6f8da466bd7a438f1bc27375fd737ffcf3, \"config: preserve config file permissions on edits\".

[[!language C \"\"\"

+                       ret = CONFIG_NO_WRITE;

\"\"\"]]

This seems utterly innocuous; the config file has some mode, and this just sets that same mode back (excluding some high bit flags). But Android goes out of its way to make /sdcard the most craptacular filesystem in use on any Linux system, so I'm not really surprised that it might just refuse all fchmod even when it's a no-op. (This is the only fchmod call currently in git.)

I've patched the bundled git to work around this. Will be a while until there is an updated autobuild..
