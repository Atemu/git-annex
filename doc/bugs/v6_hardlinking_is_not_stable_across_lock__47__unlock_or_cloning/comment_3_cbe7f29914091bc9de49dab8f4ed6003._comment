> When two files have the same content, annex.thin will only make one of them be a hard link to the annex object. The other file will have its own redundant copy of the content. This is the only way to prevent an edit to one file immediatly changing the other file, which would be very surprising behavior.

Ah, that explains my biggest confusion. Thanks!

> When the file in git has the executable bit set, annex.thin is not honored for that file either. That's a lot simpler than juggling permissions around.

Ok, I will take a note. But was it this way from the very beginning, or is this a later-added idea? From my observations, this is not true. I do have a large annex repo, I have done a global `chmod -R u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx *`, all my files have exec bit set and all of them are hardlinked (except for the files which are duplicates of other hardlinked files). I don't remember for sure, it might be that I've chmod-ed files in .git/annex/objects as well :)
