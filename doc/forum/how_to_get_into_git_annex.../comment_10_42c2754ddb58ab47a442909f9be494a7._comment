You will be unsurprised to hear that what you suggested worked. not sure what helped other than me cleaning up my working tree and doing a solid git annex add .; git annex sync. I also removed annex.thin since its evidently not helping me. 
thanks a ton. what got me here was me basically running through the \"splitting a repo\" process of making a new git repo, doing a cp -rl ./.git/annex/objects to the new repo and then running various tests on it. I just want to make sure I don't step on my own feet here. 

thanks a ton.
