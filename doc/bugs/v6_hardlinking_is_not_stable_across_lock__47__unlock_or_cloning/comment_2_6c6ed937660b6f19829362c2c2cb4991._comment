When two files have the same content, annex.thin will only make one of them
be a hard link to the annex object. The other file will have its own
redundant copy of the content. This is the only way to prevent an edit to
one file immediatly changing the other file, which would be very surprising
behavior.

When the file in git has the executable bit set, annex.thin is not honored
for that file either. That's a lot simpler than juggling permissions
around.

Does that explain everything you're seeing, or is there still a bug buried
in that transcript? I have not had time to read the whole thing.
