I currently use mergerfs, it gives me a simple union mount of a bunch of drives, for example:
/media/*/datahoard/
* meaning several stand alone drives

I wanted to use git-annex instead, so I went to one of those drives:
cd /media/strange/
and created a git annex repo, then if I go to another drive
cd /media/charm/ 
and attempt to clone the repo, it complains because /datahoard/ already exists (and isn't empty)

I want to import all of my single drives into git-annex and have the resulting directory structure be the same as the original union mount, is this possible and how would I go about doing it?

Thanks
