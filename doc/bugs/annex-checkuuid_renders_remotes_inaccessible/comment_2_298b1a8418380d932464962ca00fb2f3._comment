I've changed Remote.repo to Remote.getRepo so IO can be done there.

The remaining problem is the remoteGitConfig part
of RemoteGitConfig. That is dependent on the git config of the remote being
read when a Remote is constructed, and when checkuuid=false, that won't be
done. Only a few things use it, but my first try at removing it failed.
