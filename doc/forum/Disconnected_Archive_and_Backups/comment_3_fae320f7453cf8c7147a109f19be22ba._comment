Wow! Such an amazing feature to make your own groups. This is so powerful.

I did this, if anyone else is wanting to do this type setup:

```
groupwanted mainclient = (include=* and ((exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*) or (not copies=backup:1) or (not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)))) or approxlackingcopies=1
```

I basically added (not copies=backup:1) to the main client so that it will pull stuff off the archive and deliver it to the NAS before not needing it itself. It did exactly that; in the same sync, it grabbed content from the external ssd, transferred it to the nas, then dropped it.
