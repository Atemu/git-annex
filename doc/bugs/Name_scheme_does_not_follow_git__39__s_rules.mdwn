I can create an annex remote named 'test:/test'. git itself does not allow colons in names, though. The name scheme for an annex should be the same as for git repos themselves.

    % [...]
    % cd ../2
    % git init

    % git remote add "my:colon" ../1
    fatal: 'my:colon' is not a valid remote name
