I think after all I found part of the answer here :
http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Two_computer_setup:___34__transfer__34___or___34__full_backup__34___repository_groups__63__/

It is mentioned to use Jabber to make both clients message each other when there is something new to sync.
What about my setup with 2 groups of repos syncing together each for itself ? I read somewhere, that the jabber account will sync ALL repos.
Is the solution to create 2 Jabber accounts ?
