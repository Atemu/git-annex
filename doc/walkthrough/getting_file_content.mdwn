A repository does not always have all annexed file contents available.
When you need the content of a file, you can use "git annex get" to
make it available.

We can use this to copy everything in the laptop's annex to the
USB drive.

	# cd /media/usb/annex
	# git fetch laptop
	# git merge laptop/master
	# git annex get .
	get my_cool_big_file (from laptop...) ok
	get iso/debian.iso (from laptop...) ok

Notice that you had to git fetch and merge from laptop first, this lets
git-annex know what has changed in laptop, and so it knows about the files
present there and can get them.

The alternate approach is to set up a
[[central bare repository|tips/centralized_git_repository_tutorial]], and
always push changes to it after committing them, then in the above,
you can just pull from the central repository to get synced up to
all repositories.
