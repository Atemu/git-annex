I have also seen sync loops in direct mode repos not on NTFS.

git-annex has not supported direct mode on NTFS since earlier this year,
and now direct mode support has been removed entirely, replaced with v7
adjusted unlocked branches. I tried replicating this bug on NTFS using
those, and the syncs quieted down immediately after changes stopped being
made.

So, closing this bug.
