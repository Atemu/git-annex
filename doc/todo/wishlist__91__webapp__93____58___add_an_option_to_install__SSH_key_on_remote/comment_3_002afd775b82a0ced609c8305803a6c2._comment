After having done that on my first test repo, git-annex could sync, but failed to get the files.

    client:~/annex$ git annex get file
    get file (not available) 
      Try making some of these repositories available:
      	12345678-90ab-cdef-1234567890abcdef1 -- user@server:~/annex [origin]
    
      (Note that these git remotes have annex-ignore set: origin)
    failed
    git-annex: get: 1 failed
 
The note helps: the problem is with the origin remote having annex-ignore set. git-annex therefore ignores it. This is easily fixed by just setting the flag to false.

    client:~/annex$ git config remote.origin.annex-ignore false
