### Please describe the problem.

This is a follow up to the question [1]. I've created 4 repos with the following vicfg.

This works as expected each file lands in 1 on of the repos on the group, not both. My original repo one with the problem has the following vicfg.

With this settings all the repos tries get all of the files files that are present in other groups. Is there a way to debug this problem and tell why git-annex is trying to get the files? According to the settings it should not. I've also tried deleting all history this is a big (around 7 TB) old repo I thought maybe something got messed up along the way but it did not fix it.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
