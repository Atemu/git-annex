I was able to reproduce the error message when I made a git-annex symlink
that has a newline at the end of its link target. 

So, it seems you must have one in your tree. Find it with:

	find -ls | grep SHA256E-s1287921--0970d35c130c8f678fe9cd7

Deleting the symlink that finds and replacing it with a new symlink without
the newline at the end of its link target should fix the problem.

It would be interesting to know how this symlink came to be. If you make
another clone of the repository, do you get the same symlink? Was the file
originally added to the NTFS repository and the bad symlink somehow came
from there?

Also, what git-annex version was used to add the bad symlink?
