@joey I'm obviously missing something here, why would a shorter way to write that only be useful for direct mode?  I don't understand what the connection is between direct mode and wanting to specify whether this is a \"regular git\" file or an annexed file (except that direct mode is not supported in v7)?  I thought it was considered supported to have a mix of both large binary files and text files?  Even if some text files are large, I think I want to add them as files whose content is tracked by git, so I think I want to choose 'by hand' -- is that not really supported / considered a bad idea for some reason?
