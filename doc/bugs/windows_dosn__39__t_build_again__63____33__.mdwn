### Please describe the problem.
Seems like the Windows version is not updated?

1. https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/git-annex-installer.exe.info ==> distributionVersion = "8.20200815"
2. https://git-annex.branchable.com/news/version_8.20201007/#news-version-8.20201007.default ==> 8.20201007 ==> "Fix a build failure on Windows" ==> so where is that version / installer?

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
- git-annex version: 8.20200815-g335aae266

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
- use it to ensure some of my private data / files are save on 2x different media's :)
