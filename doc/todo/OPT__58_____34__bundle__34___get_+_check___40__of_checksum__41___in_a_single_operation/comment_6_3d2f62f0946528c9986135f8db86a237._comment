We are routinely working with datasets in the 100TB range, with individual file sizes of up to 16TB. Some of our systems have ~500MB/s disk read throughput only. The separation of download and checksuming leads to 6+ hours of additional disk reads and delay the availability of a file. Having this feature would be a stellar performance improvement for our use case. Thanks in advance.
