+1 for this style of repository (again).

Presenting the content of a git-annex repository in a way that

1. is transparent (nobody but me need know or care it's a git-annex repository)
2. doesn't require installation (NAS or other device I can't install to)
3. works without thinking (doesn't required commits or checkouts or manual deferencing symlinks - see also point 1)

would fulfil the \"like dropbox but awesome\" idea from the Kickstarter.
