Plenty of stuff going in that has not made the blog. Now I'm working on a
sort of major feature.
[[todo/support_multiple_special_remotes_with_same_uuid]] will fill in a odd
little hole in git-annex's capabilities. I think it will turn out to be
more useful than it appears. But it's major not so much in what it will
allow, but in how many assumptions in the git-annex code base have to be
worked around to implement it. After pondering lots of approaches, I have
finally gotten stuck in to implementing it, and I've made some good
progress today (on the `sameas` branch). I might finish it tomorrow.
