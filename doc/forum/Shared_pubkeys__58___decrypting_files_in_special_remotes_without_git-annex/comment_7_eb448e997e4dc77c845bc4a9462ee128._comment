I have addressed the sharedpubkey thing in the other thread.

Chunk keys may have a -S as well as the -C, if the special remote was
set up with new-style chunking enabled.

A remote can have several different chunk sizes over its
lifetime; the chunk size used for a given key is in the .log.cnk file
in the git-annex branch, documented in [[internals]].

The easy way to test if you are generating
the right key, prior to HMAC encrypting it, is to set up a non-encrypted
special remote with the same chunking configuration, and look at the chunk
keys used when files are stored in it.
