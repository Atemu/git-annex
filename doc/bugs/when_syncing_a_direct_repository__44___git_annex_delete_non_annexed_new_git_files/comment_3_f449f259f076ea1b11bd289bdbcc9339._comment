Hi

I have the same problem with git-annex 4.20131106 on debian jessie (powerpc) in direct mode and 4.20131101 on mac osx 10.8.5 (self compiled from haskell) in indirect mode.
Files directly added to git on the mac (indirect mode) are not created in the direct repository and are removed in the indirect repo after the next sync roundtrip.

Thanks a lot for all your efforts and greetings, Lukas
