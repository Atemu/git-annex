Klaus pointed out that there are two problems that keep
git-annex from being used on USB keys, that would typically
be VFAT formatted:

- Use of symlinks, which VFAT does not support. Very hard to fix.
  Instead, just use [[/bare_repositories]] on the key,
  they're supported now.
- Use of ":" in filenames of object files, also not supported.
  Could easily be fixed by reorganizing the object directory.

  (If the object directory is reorganized, should consider adding hashing
  at the same time.)
