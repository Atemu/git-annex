`importfeed` does use quvi to handle urls, but currently only if the url
is provided in a link tag, and there's no enclosure tag.

This makes sense when you consider the standard; the enclosure tag is
supposed to be an url to content to download, with no additional smarts
needed to figure out a special way to download it. The link tag is a link
to the content, so if it's all we have, maybe quvi can figure out a way to
download from it.

I don't feel that it makes sense to complicate behavior that's ok according
to the spec just because someone managed to ignore then spec when
generating this feed.
