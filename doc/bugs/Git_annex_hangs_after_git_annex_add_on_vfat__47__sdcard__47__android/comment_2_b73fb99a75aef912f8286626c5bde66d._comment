Last autobuild (installed by replacing existing)
annex 89345b7  with git 1.8.4.474.g128a96c  - also hangs on add in the same manner (in previously created tmp git in /data/data/ga.androidterm/anntmp). Not sure if I did something wrong.

Current stable release - works just fine (deinstalled, installed again - replace failed somehow)
