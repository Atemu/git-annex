I noticed the following output during a `git-annex sync --content` run
which I found a little disconcerting:

	copy file.idx copy file.idx (gpg) (checking s3...) (to s3...) 
	ok
	copy file.pack copy file.pack (checking s3...) (to s3...) 
	ok
	(Recording state in git...)

It's confusing that seemingly only the first file got encrypted (gpg).

Fortunately, it appears that actually all files were encrypted (only GPGHMAC file names in remote location),
so this is hopefully just a cosmetic issue.

git-annex version: 5.20141024-g613f396
