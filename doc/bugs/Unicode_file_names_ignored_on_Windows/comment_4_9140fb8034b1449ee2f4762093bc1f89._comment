As well as the default encoding, I've tried `utf8`, `utf16`, `utf16le`, and `utf16be` encodings, and none of them is able to successfully read the git ls-files output, all fail with encoding error. (I also tried `mkUTF16 RoundtripFailure` but it completely broke git-annex.)

Unsure where to go from here..
