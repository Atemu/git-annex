When a `git annex move` is interrupted at a point where the content has
been transferred, but not yet dropped from the remote, resuming the move
will often refuse to drop the content, because it would violate numcopies.

Eg, if numcopies is 2, and there is only 1 extant copy, on a remote,
git-annex move --from remote will normally ignore numcopies (since it's not
getting any worse) and remove the content from the remote after
transferring it. But, on resume, git-annex sees there are 2 copies and
numcopies is 2, so it can't drop the copy from the remote.

This happens to me often enough to be annoying.

Perhaps some local state could avoid this problem?
