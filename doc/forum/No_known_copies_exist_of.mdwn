I just created a repo and added some content as described here:
https://writequit.org/articles/getting-started-with-git-annex.html

Some of the directories I added ended up fine, while others have lot's of broken symlinks.

    git annex fsck file
gives me :

    ** No known copies exist of file
    failed
    git-annex: fsck: 1 failed


and

    git annex get file

gives me:

    get file (not available) 
      No other repository is known to contain the file.
    failed
    git-annex: get: 1 failed


The objects directory is about the same size as the repo was before I annexed it.

Any ideas on how to troubleshoot further?


Thanks!
