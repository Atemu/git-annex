Seems to me that having a file in your working tree whose content is
missing is something that it's reasonable for fsck to mention as a problem.

       When a key is specified, indicates that the content of that
       key has been irretrievably lost. This prevents commands  like
       git annex  fsck  --all from complaining about it; --all will
       not operate on the key anymore.

That's the intention of marking a key as dead, to avoid a fsck --all
complaining about some long-ago loss that is no longer relevant but left
traces in the repository.

So I don't see a bug here.
