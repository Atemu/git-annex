Indeed, regular webdav special remote uses prepareDav
which sets up a single DAV context that is used for all stores,
but export does not and so creates a new context each time.

S3 gets around this using an MVar that contains the S3 handle.
Webdav should be able to do the same.

(The upload to a temp location is necessary, otherwise resuming an
interrupted upload would not be able to check which files had been fully
uploaded yet in some situations. Or something like that. I forget the exact
circumstances, but it's documented in a comment where storeExport is defined
in Types.Remote.)
