I am following the instructions at [tips/publishing_your_files_to_the_public](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/publishing_your_files_to_the_public/) to export trees to a public remote. Often I want to just share a single file publicly with someone, not an entire folder (which is what export supports).

For example I am using [git-annex-remote-googledrive](https://github.com/Lykos153/git-annex-remote-googledrive) and I have created a new folder with public read access from drive.google.com. If I set this folder up as an exporttree remote I could then export a local annexed sub-folder to it. What I really want though is to pick a single file to share publicly with someone and send that to my public folder. Does anyone have thoughts on an existing workflow that might achieve this?
