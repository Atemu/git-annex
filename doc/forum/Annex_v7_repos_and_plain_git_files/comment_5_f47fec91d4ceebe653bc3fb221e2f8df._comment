Thks for pointing me to Conda, I didn't know it.

About Ubuntu 19.10 old git-annex package, it seems I have the expected revision. I rarely mess with the package manager (only nvidia drivers!), so I don't expect any issue there.

Yes, I agree, my git-annex package is an old one. Ubuntu is supposed to be a stable main stream distro, so optional packages like git-annex are not the cutting edge ones. And 19.10 is not a LTS release, you can expect the situation to be worse on 18.04 LTS. Same on Debian, Raspbian etc...
