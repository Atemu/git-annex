I think I found a part of the problem. I still don't know why there was this strange key setup in the beginning. Maybe i did this manually and forgot about it instantly...

However, today I again had the problem with ending up in git-annex-shell on the commandline. To debug this I called ssh -vvv ... and found out that ssh somehow found the private key in ~/.ssh/key.git-annex-servername-username and ofcourse tried to use it.
Moving the key to a subdirectory in ~/.ssh/ and fixing the path in ~/.ssh/config solved my problem again.
