I, too, am bewildered by how this major, breaking change was implemented and communicated so casually. Having basically been drawn in by the default v5 workflow and just barely finished migrating all of my archives/data sets and many of my current projects, I was initially convinced I must have not understood something right. But here we are, and at least I'm glad I'm not alone.

To a certain extent, I get that git-annex users are expected to be pretty savvy, but the auto-upgrade caught me completely by suprise. I'm on a Mac and ran `brew upgrade ` as part of everyday maintenance, made some changes in my repo, synced it to a remote and to my complete surprise was the repo now behaving the exact opposite way as the day before, i.e. `git add` annexed the file.

I am super happy about git-annex and your work on it Joey, but this has been a scary experience for me. And I'd very much like the default v5 workflow back.
