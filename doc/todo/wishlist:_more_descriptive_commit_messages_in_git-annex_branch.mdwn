as of git-annex version 3.20110719, all git-annex commits only contain the word "update" as a commit message. given that the contents of the commit are pretty non-descriptive (SHA1 hashes for file names, uuids for repository names), i suggest to have more descriptive commit messages, as shown here:

    /mnt/usb_disk/photos/2011$ git annex get
    /mnt/usb_disk/photos/2011$ git show git-annex
    [...]
    usb-disk-photos: get 2011
    
    * 10 files retrieved from 2 sources (9 from local-harddisk, 1 from my-server)
    * 120 files were already present
    * 2 files could not be retrieved
    /mnt/usb_disk/photos/2011$ cd ~/photos/2011/07
    ~/photos/2011/07$ git copy --to my-server
    ~/photos/2011/07$ git show git-annex
    [...]
    local-harddisk: copy 2011/07 to my-server
    
    * 20 files pushed
    ~/photos/2011/07$

in my opinion, the messages should at least contain

* what command was used
* in which repository they were executed
* which files or directories they affected (not necessarily all files, but what was given on command line or implicitly from the working directory)
