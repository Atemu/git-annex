I've implemented `remote.<name>.annex-retry`, `annex.retry`, 
`remote.<name>.annex-retry-delay`, `annex.retry-delay` configs, so you can
have full control over retry behavior for remotes.

Since these are fully generic, not at the HTTP level, they'll
make any and all transfer failures be retried, no matter why it failed.
Which could be a good thing or a bad thing..
