Indeed, the object seems to be there, but it looks like `dropunused`
probably for some reason fails its `inAnnex` check and so skips it.

Does `git config annex.thin` output true? If so, and if the object file you
found does not checksum to the right value, `dropunused` would skip it.

That seems to me to be a bug, it probably should delete even modified files
in this case. But I don't know if it's the bug you're seeing.
