`git annex version` is how you tell git-annex to print its version.

The problem is not with the locally installed version of git-annex. You have a *very* old version of git-annex-shell installed on the server you're using as a remote. The last version of git-annex that did not support `git-annex-shell --uuid` was 3.20110928. You need to upgrade it to make it work with modern git-annex.
