NAT traversal requires central infrastructure and is unreliable at best. Obviously, a for-profit entity like bittorrent can shoulder that.

For LAN situations, [zeroconf](http://www.zeroconf.org/) along with passphrase-based pairing may be the long-term answer. Arguably, that would enhance vanilla Git almost as much as it would enhance git-annex, but that does not seem likely to happen.
