I was git-annex-adding a folder of big files.
I ran the command while inside a folder I didn't need anymore.
I deleted the folder with nautilus (moved it to trash) which caused the cwd to change and that really confused git-annex.

Root of repo is audio-recordings/

While inside audio-recordings/a I ran `git annex add ../audio-files`

Then I deleted audio-recordings/a with Nautilus which caused its path to change to /.Trash-1000/files/a

As soon as git-annex finished hashing the file it was hashing, this happened:

```
add ../audio-files/moto-maxx/2018.04.17 1438.wav 
100%  579.95 MiB      160 MiB/s 0s
  ../audio-files/moto-maxx/2018.04.17 1438.wav changed while it was being added

    --output <file>       Output to a specific file

^Ceral-pathspecs","add","--"] exited 123)

```

The file that was being added was left like this:

ll "audio-files/moto-maxx/2018.04.17 1438.wav"

-r--r--r-- 2 ### ### 608121644 abr 17  2018 'audio-files/moto-maxx/2018.04.17 1438.wav'

It appears git-annex just chmoded it, but didn't symlinkify it.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Ubuntu 20.04 focal

Linux 5.8.0-050800-generic #202008022230 SMP Sun Aug 2 22:33:21 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

git-annex version: 8.20200226

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I am absolutely in love with it. I even built a special remote for it and I'm now building another because that one was stupid.

Seriously, git-annex is amazing.
