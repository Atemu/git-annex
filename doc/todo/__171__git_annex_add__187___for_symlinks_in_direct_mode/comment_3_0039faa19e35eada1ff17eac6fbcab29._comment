Recently, `git annex add` started adding files
to git, if annex.largefiles didn't match them.

So, it's possible to use that to add eg, source files. But it currently
skips symlinks (unless they're git-annex symlinks).

What I think makes sense to do is make it also process
symlinks, and always check them into git as-is. So, git-annex add becomes
like git-add except smart about adding large files to the annex.
