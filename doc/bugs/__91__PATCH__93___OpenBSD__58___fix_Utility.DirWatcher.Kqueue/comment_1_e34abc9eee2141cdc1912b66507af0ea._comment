FYI, `git annex test` has just a few failures, which can all be blamed on my setup.

(git-annex is not in PATH seen by commands run via ssh, so I get a bunch of failures like \"/bin/sh: git-annex-shell: not found\". In practice I work around this by setting remote.xxx.annex-shell=/home/falsifian/bin/git-annex-shell in other repos.)

PS if you want to credit me in a commit message, I'm `James Cook <falsifian@falsifian.org>`.
