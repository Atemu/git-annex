[[!toggleable text="""
   * Sanitize debian changelog version before putting it into cabal file.
     Closes: #[708619](http://bugs.debian.org/708619)
   * Switch to MonadCatchIO-transformers for better handling of state while
     catching exceptions.
   * Fix a zombie that could result when running a process like gpg to
     read and write to it.
   * Allow building with gpg2.
   * Disable building with the haskell threaded runtime when the webapp
     is not built. This may fix builds on mips, s390x and sparc, which are
     failing to link -lHSrts\_thr
   * Temporarily build without webapp on kfreebsd-i386, until yesod is
     installable there again.
   * Direct mode bug fix: After a conflicted merge was automatically resolved,
     the content of a file that was already present could incorrectly
     be replaced with a symlink.
   * Fix a bug in the git-annex branch handling code that could
     cause info from a remote to not be merged and take effect immediately.
   * Direct mode is now fully tested by the test suite.
   * Detect bad content in ~/.config/git-annex/program and look in PATH instead.
   * OSX: Fixed gpg included in dmg.
   * Linux standalone: Back to being built with glibc 2.13 for maximum
     portability."""]]
