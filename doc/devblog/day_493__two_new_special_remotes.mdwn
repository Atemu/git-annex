I've been traveling and at conferences.

In the meantime, Lykos has released
[git-annex-remote-googledrive](https://github.com/Lykos153/git-annex-remote-googledrive),
a replacement for an older, unmaintained Google Drive special remote.

Today I added a special remote that stores files on an Android device
using `adb`. It supports `git annex export`, so the files stored on 
the Android device can have the same filenames as in the git-annex
repository. I have plans for making `git annex import` support
special remotes, and other features to make bi-directional
sync with Android work well.

Of course, there is some overlap between that and the Android port,
but they probably serve different use cases.
