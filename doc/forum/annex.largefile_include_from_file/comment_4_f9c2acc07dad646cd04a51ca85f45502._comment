Sorry for the delay; basically, since I'm using git submodules inside the annex repo as well, while I might want to exclude certain files from my submodules, I still want them in the root annex repository; so I want to read all exclusions from, at the very least, the global `~/.gitignore` (which I *think* also affects `git annex`?) so that when adding to the annex, I'd still have the excluded files when cloning somewhere else.

As a side question, does `git annex` honor `.gitignores` in sub-directories as well, for excluding files in said sub-directories?
