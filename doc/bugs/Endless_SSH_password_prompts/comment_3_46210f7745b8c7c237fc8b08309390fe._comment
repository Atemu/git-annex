I am seeing the same problem. It happened on a machine running git-annex on Debian Testing some weeks ago, and I eventually disabled the offending repository for my sanity (incidentally - it seems to have vanished so I don't know how to re-enable it apart from adding it again).

It has just very recently (some days) started on this machine running Debian Unstable.
