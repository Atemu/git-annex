I find it's not useful to split a conversation between multiple different
pages, so this bug is a bit counterproductive. 

But, you made up for that by posting the whole vicfg, which I was somehow
able to notice, amoungst all the noise, has this unusual bit:

	required 132503d4-dcde-4790-aabb-ee5ba539a3a0 =
	# (for ozge)
	required 1e1d0c4e-b1da-465f-9140-7128a7e3ee13 =
	# (for irem)
	required aabc3536-a423-42b6-a234-5f110607296e =
	# (for yesim)
	required ba3593c0-ddf1-4433-9916-aa25d1a52895 =
	# (for buse [origin])
	required bff7238e-bd92-4929-88a8-c59c1a1dcf03 =

So, required content has been set to "". It turns out that when this is done,
git-annex thinks that all files are preferred! This is because of a bug
when combining the required content and preferred content expressions.

I reproduced this; `git annex get --auto` was not getting a file,
which was already known to be in another PodA repository. Then I ran `git annex required . ""`
and `git annex get --auto` started getting all files.

You can't unset a required content setting back to being commented out.
A reasonable workaround is to set those to "groupwanted" too. Or get the
next git-annex release.
