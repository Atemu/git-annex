I kind of like that the test suite will fail if git-annex is being used in
some broken environment, because it gives an easy way to check if git-annex
is able to fully work.

Note that, the test suite does try a self-test of its ability to use gpg
before proceeding with other gpg tests; if that self-test fails it does
abort the other tests in that test block. That self-test does not currently
test encryption or decrpryption, only that gpg can access the test key
pair.
