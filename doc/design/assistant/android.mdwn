Porting git-annex to Android will use the Android native SDK.

A hopefully small Java app will be developed, which runs the webapp
daemon, and a web browser to display it.

### programs to port

These will probably need to be bundled into the Android app, unless already
available in the App Store.

* ssh (native ssh needed for scp, not a client like ConnectBot)
* rsync
* gpg
* git (not all git commands are needed, but a core plumbing and a few like `git-add` are.)

### FAT sucks

The main media partition will use some awful FAT filesystem format from
1982 that cannot support git-annex's symlinks. Hopefully it can at least
handle all of git's filenames. Possible approaches to this:

* Keep only a bare git repo on Android. The app would then need to include
  a file browser to access the files in there, and adding a file would move
  it into the repo. Not ideal.
* Implement [[smudge]] filters to avoid needing symlinks. Difficult.
* Use a bare git repo but don't keep files in `annex/objects`, instead
  leave them outside the repo, and add some local mapping to find them.
  Seems best?
* Use a `LD_PRELOAD` wrapper to do Something Crazy.

(May want to consider which of these would make a Windows port easier too.)
