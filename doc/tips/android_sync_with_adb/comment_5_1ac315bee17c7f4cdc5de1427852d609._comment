How do I manually create this android_cable/master remote branch?

For the sake of testing, I created another remote on the same smartphone, and indeed, if \"import\" finishes in one try, there is a 

```

   $ cat refs/remotes/android_test_cable/master 
   8d7ada85897ef7df05bcdf1f2464ca678e03bd3b

```

How do I find an object that corresponds to the original `android_cable` special remote?
