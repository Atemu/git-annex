### Please describe the problem.

I do `git annex add .` to add all new files. However I'm busy copying a big file. This file fails with "... changed while it was being added".
When the `add` ends, none of the files have been added.

I would expect all the files except the one that was changing to be added.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Add files while changing one.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20140412ubuntu1

### Please provide any additional information below.

# End of transcript or log.
