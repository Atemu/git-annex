Even better would be if git-annex had a \"server\" mode where one git-annex process runs and exposes a REST API for invoking git-annex commands (cf. [[todo/universal_batch_mode]]; something like [this](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/RESTAPI/)).  Then the clean and smudge filters could be lightweight scripts that just call curl.
