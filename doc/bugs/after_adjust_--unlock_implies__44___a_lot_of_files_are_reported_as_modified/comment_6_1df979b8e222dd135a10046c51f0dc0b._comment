Being on sshfs makes me wonder if perhaps something synthesized by that
filesystem is confusing git, so eg it thinks the inode or mtime of a file has
changed and so it's modified.

However, normally git status does the same work to verify if there's really
a modification as git diff does (running the smudge filter in this case).
So I'm not clear what's going on here, but it's currently looking more like
a problem at the git level, or a filesystem that is too wonky for git to
work well, rather than anything git-annex can do.

I have to wonder why you'd even use git-annex on sshfs. The more usual way
would be to have a local repository with a remote using ssh to access the
server.
