Thanks a lot!  Do I understand correctly that this can't be done from the [tarballs on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/git-annex), and requires [[checking out the full source tree|install/fromsource]]?  (And that there is URL from which the full source repo tarball for a given released version can be downloaded?)
