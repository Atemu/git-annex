What's actually going on is that incremental fsck has switched to using a
sqlite database to record what files it's fscked. Since making a new commit
to the database after every single file would tend to slow it down a lot,
it only commits after each 1000 files fscked.

So, if you're fscking less than 1000 files, it won't resume; with more
files it will resume after some even thousand multiple of files.

This could probably be improved by making it commit after some period of
time, like once per minute or so.
