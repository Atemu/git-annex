I am investigating how to create special remotes using the library  Lykos153 / AnnexRemote. I have copied [this file](https://github.com/Lykos153/AnnexRemote/blob/master/examples/git-annex-remote-directory) locally, renamed it, set it up as needed, but can not initialise a remote with it. 

I get this:

    git annex initremote foo type=external externaltype=precomp encryption=none directory=/z/old/1111   
    initremote foo 
    git-annex: Unexpected parameters: directory
    failed
    git-annex: initremote: 1 failed

The order of the arguments make no difference. Do I need to somehow register parameters now, that was not required before? Or something else?
