That is limited to fsck activities, so adding a display of specifically the
last time a repo was fscked seems better than a more open-ended thing if
it's going to use that information.

But, I don't think that indicating which repos were fscked recently is
likely to really determine which repos are active.

And I don't think there's any cheap enough way to get at perhaps more general
activity, such as changes to the content of a remote. Also a remote could
have its contents unchanging and still be actively used frequently to
access the data stored in it.

I wonder if perhaps using group information in git-annex info's list of
repositories could address the same need. If nothing else you could
put repos into an "active" group manually.

Maybe something like this:

	semitrusted repositories:
		uuid -- foo@bar [origin] (active, transfer)
		uuid -- foo@bla
		uuid -- foo@baz [here] (active, client)
		uuid -- foo@whatever
		uuid -- foo@xyzzy (backup)

There could be a switch to filter to a specific group.
