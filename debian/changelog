git-annex (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * fsck: Check if annex.numcopies is satisfied.
  * fsck: Verify the sha1 of files when the SHA1 backend is used.
  * fsck: Verify the size of files when the WORM backend is used.
  * fsck: Allow specifying individual files if fscking everything
    is not desired.
  * fsck: Fix bug, introduced in 0.04, in detection of unused data.

git-annex (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Optimize both pre-commit and lock subcommands to not call git diff
    on every file being committed/locked.
    (This actually also works around a bug in ghc, that caused
    git-annex 0.04 pre-commit to sometimes corrupt filename being read
    from git ls-files and fail. 
    See <http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4493>
    The excessive number of calls made by pre-commit exposed the ghc bug.
    Thanks Josh Triplett for the debugging.)
  * Build with -O2.

git-annex (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add unlock subcommand, which replaces the symlink with a copy of
    the file's content in preparation of changing it. The "edit" subcommand
    is an alias for unlock.
  * Add lock subcommand.
  * Unlocked files will now automatically be added back into the annex when
    committed (and the updated symlink committed), by some magic in the
    pre-commit hook.
  * The SHA1 backend is now fully usable.
  * Add annex.version, which will be used to automate upgrades
    between incompatible versions.
  * Reorganised the layout of .git/annex/
  * The new layout will be automatically upgraded to the first time
    git-annex is used in a repository with the old layout.
  * Note that git-annex 0.04 cannot transfer content from old repositories
    that have not yet been upgraded.
  * Annexed file contents are now made unwritable and put in unwriteable
    directories, to avoid them accidentially being removed or modified.
    (Thanks Josh Triplett for the idea.)
  * Add build dep on libghc6-testpack-dev. Closes: #603016
  * Avoid using runghc to run test suite as it is not available on all
    architectures. Closes: #603006

git-annex (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix support for file:// remotes.
  * Add --verbose
  * Fix SIGINT handling.
  * Fix handling of files with unusual characters in their name.
  * Fixed memory leak; git-annex no longer reads the whole file list
    from git before starting, and will be much faster with large repos.
  * Fix crash on unknown symlinks.
  * Added remote.annex-scp-options and remote.annex-ssh-options.
  * The backends to use when adding different sets of files can be configured
    via gitattributes.
  * In .gitattributes, the git-annex-backend attribute can be set to the
    names of backends to use when adding different types of files.
  * Add fsck subcommand. (For now it only finds unused key contents in the
    annex.)

git-annex (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Can scp annexed files from remote hosts, and check remote hosts for
    file content when dropping files.
  * New move subcommand, that makes it easy to move file contents from
    or to a remote.
  * New fromkey subcommand, for registering urls, etc.
  * git-annex init will now set up a pre-commit hook that fixes up symlinks
    before they are committed, to ensure that moving symlinks around does not
    break them.
  * More intelligent and fast staging of modified files; git add coalescing.
  * Add remote.annex-ignore git config setting to allow completly disabling
    a given remote.
  * --from/--to can be used to control the remote repository that git-annex
    uses.
  * --quiet can be used to avoid verbose output
  * New plumbing-level dropkey and addkey subcommands.
  * Lots of bug fixes.
