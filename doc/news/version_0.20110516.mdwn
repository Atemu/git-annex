   * Add a few tweaks to make it easy to use the Internet Archive's variant
     of S3. In particular, munge key filenames to comply with the IA's filename
     limits, disable encryption, support their nonstandard way of creating
     buckets, and allow x-archive-* headers to be specified in initremote to
     set item metadata.
   * Added filename extension preserving variant backends SHA1E, SHA256E, etc.
   * migrate: Use current filename when generating new key, for backends
     where the filename affects the key name.
   * Work around a bug in Network.URI's handling of bracketed ipv6 addresses."""]]
