### Please describe the problem.

When trying to link/create Rsync.net report (linked already to unix laptop) on android via webapp it fails in resolving hostname. Using dig in Termux resolves the hostname fine, verified no typos. Verified same behaviour whether using WiFI or Cell Data network

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Via webapp, normal process for adding rsync.net repository. Using default annex folder, my assigned hostname from RSync is 'usw-s007.rsync.net' (without quotes :) and that syncs fine with my linux laptop

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Only recently came across it :) but sufficiently excited about prospects that I signed up at rsync.net for a year. Works great thus far on my Qubes laptop (currently only running it from one of my Fedora 30 VMs but looking at other ways of leveraging it as I dig further.
