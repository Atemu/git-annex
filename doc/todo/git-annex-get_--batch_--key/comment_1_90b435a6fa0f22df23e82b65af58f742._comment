--key can't be reused for another meaning like this, it would make "--key
foo" be ambiguous.

It would need to be some other option, --batch-key or whatever.

Adding this would seem to open the door to adding it to every command that
supports --batch now. I'm unsure if the added complexity justifies it.

I'd be more sanguine if there were a way to reuse the existing batch
machinery and apply it to keys. But many commands' --batch honor file
matching options (eg --copies or --include), and that cannot be done when
using keys.
