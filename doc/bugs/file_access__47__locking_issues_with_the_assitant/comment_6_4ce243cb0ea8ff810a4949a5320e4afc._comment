No. Direct mode makes this kind of problem less likely to occur.

Are you only seeing this problem on OSX?

My guess, which  is only a guess at this point is that while direct mode leaves files in-place etc, which should avoid this kind of problem, it does mess with their permissions berifly when ingesting them into the annex. The write bit is breifly turned off,
while it checks that nothing currently has the file open to be written.
