### Please describe the problem.

After installing a nightly build from https://qa.nest-initiative.org/view/msysGit/job/msysgit-git-annex-assistant-test/, ssh fails to run when launched by the webapp. It shows a system error dialog with the message "The program can't start because msys-crypto-1.0.0.dll is missing...". The dll is present in $PROGRAMFILES/Git/bin, and ssh works when run from the command line.
