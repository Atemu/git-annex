Please let me know if there already is a way of achieving this; I’ve googled around a lot, but could not find any information pertaining to my particular problem.

I am using direct mode in a bunch of repositories where I need quick write access to content and where I am not interested in preserving history. Some of these repositories do contain regular symlinks, however. Now, I suppose that in indirect repos, the way of adding symlinks would be to just «git add» them. However, since these are direct mode repos, I cannot do this.

Is there already a good way of adding symlinks in direct mode? If not, I would find it useful if there were one.

Best regards,
T.
