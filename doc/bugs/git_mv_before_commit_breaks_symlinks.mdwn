### Please describe the problem.

When I `git mv` a file that I just `git annex add`-ed without having `git commit`-ed it first, then the symlink will break.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    $ mkdir foo
    $ echo hello > foo/bar
    $ git annex add foo/bar
    $ git mv foo/bar .

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20140529 on Debian testing
