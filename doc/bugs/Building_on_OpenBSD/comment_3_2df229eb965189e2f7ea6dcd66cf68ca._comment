And the UUID package requires network-info and git-annex seems to require the UUID package.
Also notice that the configure can't find the SHA commands:
     checking sha1... not available
     checking sha256... not available
     checking sha512... not available
     checking sha224... not available
     checking sha384... not available
     Configuring git-annex-5.20140129...
     setup: user error (At least the following dependencies are missing:
     uuid -any)

Even though:
     % which sha1
     /bin/sha1
     % which sha256
     /bin/sha256
