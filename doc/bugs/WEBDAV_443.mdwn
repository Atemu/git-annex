What steps will reproduce the problem?

```
WEBDAV_USERNAME=pradermecker@yahoo.ca WEBDAV_PASSWORD=xxxxxx git annex initremote box.com type=webdav url=https://www.box.com/dav/git-annex chunksize=75mb encryption=none
```

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I have: 
```
git-annex: WebDAV failed to write file: FailedConnectionException "www.box.com" 443: user error
```
# What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

```
git-annex version: 4.20130314
local repository version: 3
default repository version: 3
supported repository versions: 3 4
upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2
build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP DNS
```
Archlinux 64: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex/

# Please provide any additional information below.

1. Try my password a couple of time. It works with Chrome, Firefox or cadaver
2. I am using a zsh shell and try exporting both env. variables
3. git-annex test has errors

```
    git-annex: foo not found
    Error in:   git-annex crypto          
    foo: getSymbolicLinkStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)
    Cases: 1  Tried: 1  Errors: 1  Failures: 0
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Some tests failed!
      (This could be due to a bug in git-annex, or an incompatability
      with utilities, such as git, installed on this system.)
```
