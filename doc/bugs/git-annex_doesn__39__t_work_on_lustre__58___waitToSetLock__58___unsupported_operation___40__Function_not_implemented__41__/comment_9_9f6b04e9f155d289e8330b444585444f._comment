git uses dot-locks (.git/index.lck).

I need to understand why multiple Lustre users seem to have it configured
in a way that doesn't allow using the locking capabilities that are built
into it. Maybe there's a good reason they do that; but adding ugly top-level
dot locking to git-annex without a good reason could be a bad mistake.
