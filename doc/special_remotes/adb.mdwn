This special remote stores files on an Android device.

The `adb` program is used to access the Android device, which
allows connecting to it in various ways like a USB cable or wifi.

## example

To make git-annex store files in the /sdcard/annex directory
on the Android device, and export the current master tree to it:

	git annex initremote android type=adb androiddirectory=/sdcard/annex encryption=none exporttree=yes
	git annex export master --to android

## configuration

A number of parameters can be passed to `git annex initremote` to configure
the adb remote.

* `androiddirectory` - Set to the location on the Android device where
  files for the special remote are stored.

* `androidserial` - Normally this is not needed, but if multiple Android
  devices are accessible, you'll be prompted to use it to specify which
  one to use.

* `exporttree` - Set to "yes" to make this special remote usable
  by [[git-annex-export]]. It will not be usable as a general-purpose
  special remote. Since this makes the exported files easily browsable
  on the Android device, you will almost always want to enable this.

* `encryption` - One of "none", "hybrid", "shared", or "pubkey".
  See [[encryption]].

* `keyid` - Specifies the gpg key to use for [[encryption]].

* `chunk` - Enables [[chunking]] when storing large files.
