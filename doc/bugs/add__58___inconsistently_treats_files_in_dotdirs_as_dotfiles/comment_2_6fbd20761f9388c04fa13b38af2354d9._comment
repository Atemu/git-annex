I'm also reluctant to start another behavior change in this area, there has
been more than enough drama around dotfile handling recently.

At least the behavior change would only result in small files that users
want to store in git being annexed, rather than large files being
unexpectedly put in git.

It would also be possible for users to get back the current behavior if
desired by configuring annex.dotfiles and annex.largefiles.

Also as far as the priority of this goes, I think that the number of
dotdirs that contain files that get version controlled at all is probably
quite small, excluding version controlling of HOME.
