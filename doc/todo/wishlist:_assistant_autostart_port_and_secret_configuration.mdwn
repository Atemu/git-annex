When starting the assistant when logging in to the system (`--autostart`) it choses a new port an secret everytime. Having the assistant open in a pinned firefox tab which automatically restores when firefox starts we need to get the url from `.git/annex/url` and copy/paste it into the pinned tab. It would be very nice to have a configuration option which assigns a fixed port and secret so everytime the assistant is autostarted it uses the same settings and firefox is happy to open it automatically on start.
