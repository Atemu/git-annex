The command that blocks until the remote is ready sounds like a pretty good
idea.

I wonder, what about downloads from the remote, those could also overload
some remote.

Is your KBFS remote an external special remote, or are you just using a
directory special remote on that filesystem? If it were an external special
remote, you could just make it delay until ready when it receives a
TRANSFER request.

(BTW, the solution to each git-annex copy creating a git-annex branch
commit is annex.alwayscommit=false. Or perhaps usng --batch to drive a
single copy command.)
