I feel that the following commands should do essentially the same (ie they do what I intend to do).
More, they even display the correct (expected) behaviour, it seems the strangeness is introduced by the webapp (which, by the way, is really cool).

	cd ~
	mkdir Direct Indirect
	git init Direct/
	git init Indirect/
	cd Direct/
	git annex init Direct
	git annex direct
	cd ../Indirect
	git annex init Indirect
	git annex indirect
    touch Indirect
    git annex add Indirect
    git commit -m 'Initial commit'
	git remote add Direct ..//Direct/
	git annex assistant
	cd ../Direct/
    touch Direct
    git annex add Direct
    git commit -m 'Initial commit'
	git remote add Indirect ../Indirect
	git annex assistant
    touch Test
    echo Test > Test
