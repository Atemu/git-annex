I'm doubtful that this would actually let the interface be simplified,
there are too many differences in the capabilities of different remotes.

For example, if a S3 bucket has versioning disabled, and git-annex imports
from it, then in this scheme it would need to re-upload the import to the
key-value location. But, if a S3 bucket has versioning enabled, that upload
would be redundant and should not be done. And, if a S3 bucket is
read-only, then an import can't re-upload.

Also, not all users are going to want export remotes to store past versions 
of files; if they're used for some kind of publication, you may not want
the exposure/cost of publishing old versions of files there. Of course, you
could drop the old versions from the remote later, but this would be a
workflow change from how export remotes work now.

So it seems to me that this would need to be an optional thing.
