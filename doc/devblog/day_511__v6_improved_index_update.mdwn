Found a better way to update the index after get/drop in v6 repositories.
I was able to close all the todos around that.

Only problem is there is a race where a modification that happens to a file
soon after get/drop gets unexpectedly staged by the index update. I made
this race's window as small as I reasonably can. Fully fixing it would
involve improvements to the git update-index interface, or another way to
update the index.

Only two todos remain in [[todo/smudge]] that
I want to fix in the remainder of this v6 sprint.
