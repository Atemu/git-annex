I reproduced with git-annex from debian stable on WSL in MS Edge preview
fall 2019. Also with a current git-annex autobuild.

Interestingly, using v7 with unlocked files not in an adjusted branch
seems to work ok. Which seems to indicate that sqlite is generally working.

May be somehow caused by there being 2 git-annex processes running when it
fails. They could be contending over the database in some way that
works less well in WSL.

Backing up that theory, .git/annex/keys/db does get created and is
populated with the right tables and data.
