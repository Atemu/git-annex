I have pushed out a preliminary fix. The old mixed-case directories will be left where they are, and still read from by git-annex. New data will be written to new, lower-case directories. I think that once git stops seeing changes being made
to mixed-case, colliding directories, the bugs you ran into won't manifest any more.

You will need to find a way to get your git repository out of the state where it complains about uncommitted files (and won't let you commit them). I have not found a reliable way to do that; git reset --hard worked in one case but not in another. May need to clone a fresh git repository.

Let me know how it works out.
