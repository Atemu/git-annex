# Bootstraps from an empty cabal to all the necessary haskell packages
# being installed, with the necessary patches to work on Android.
#
# You should install ghc-android first.
#
# Note that the newest version of packages is installed. 
# It attempts to reuse patches for older versions, but 
# new versions of packages often break cross-compilation by adding TH, 
# etc
#
# Future work: Convert to using the method used here:
# https://github.com/kaoskorobase/ghc-ios-cabal-scripts/
