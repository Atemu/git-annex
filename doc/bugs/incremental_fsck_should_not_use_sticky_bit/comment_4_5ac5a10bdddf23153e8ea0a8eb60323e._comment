@helmut Well, true, it could overwrite the old ref with a new one at the start of a new fsck pass. If there was a separate ref for each uuid, this would work even for mixed local/remote fscking. And git should eventually drop the objects associated with the old ref, probably in `gc --auto`, which has a default --prune of 2 weeks.

The git overhead would probably be fine for fsck. I am less sure about it for the direct mode mapping files, which can be queried quite frequently. In particular inAnnex is used lots of places, often repeatedly on a lot of files, and it uses withObjectLoc, which uses associatedFiles.
