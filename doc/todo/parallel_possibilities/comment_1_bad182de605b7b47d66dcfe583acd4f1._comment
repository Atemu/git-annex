When operating on many files, maybe run N parallel commands where i'th command ignores paths for which `(hash(filename) module N) != i`.   Or, if git index has size I, i'th command ignores paths that are not legixographically between `index[(I/N)*i]` and `index[(I/N)*(i+1)]` (for index state at command start).  Extending [[git-annex-matching-options]] with `--block=i` would let this be done using `xargs`.
