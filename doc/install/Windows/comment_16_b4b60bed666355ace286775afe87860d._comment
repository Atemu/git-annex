FWIW -- there is now CI for git-annex on linux (debian-based), osx, and Windows on https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/ which builds git-annex installer, tests git-annex, and then tests datalad against it in a few scenarios.
ATM it runs on cron, so not for each git-annex commit.  We will see if we need/want more frequent builds. Artifacts (re)distribution will eventually be established on http://datasets.datalad.org/datalad/packages/ but we aren't there yet.
