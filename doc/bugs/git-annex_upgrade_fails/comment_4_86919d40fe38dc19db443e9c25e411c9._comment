You are right, git is at version 2.11.0-3+deb9u4 on this machine.
OOM killer might be, the machine has 2GB RAM. During the upgrade I observed the memory usage increasing steadily but at some point decreasing again.

Unfortunately I've nuked the repo in the meantime, so I cannot try your suggestion of retrying after upgrading git. Also it looks like I need to go from stretch to testing to get a git >= 2.22. Which will probably not happen too soon.

Thanks,
Felix
