I don't use it myself, but rsync can be used with others remote shells, among which rsh supports unencrypted streams. You probably want to set up a secure authorization mechanism to deny access to intruders, and for that kerberos comes to the rescue :-) I didn't try the combination, but it should work over git-annex already.
