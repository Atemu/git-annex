For [preferred content expressions](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-preferred-content/), is there an option analogous to the "--in=repo" [matching option](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-matching-options/)?

I was surprised not to find it, but maybe I have overlooked something.

Many thanks
