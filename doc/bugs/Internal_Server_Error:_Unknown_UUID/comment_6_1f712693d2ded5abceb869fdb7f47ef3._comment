I've finally been clued in to the cause of this. If a ssh-agent is running, and has been configured to use a ssh key (by running `ssh-add`), this apparently prevents git-annex from using the key it sets up during local pairing. I have reproduced the described bug by this method.

Something similar might also affect adding a remote ssh server, I'm not sure about that yet.
