"cabal: not found"

Since cabal-install is a build-dependency of the package, why is cabal not
available?

The debian package builds just fine here. I diagnose that the problem is on
your build system.

All your patch is doing is modifying it to not build the package using
cabal. But, debian/cabal-wrapper's comments explain why we need to use
cabal.
