i did all the steps you described. not even on my local box... two repos... assistant running on both repos (checked out repos with workdir)... processes run fine. i add files to repo A. it gets tranfered to repo B. the assistant on repo B does not merge. maybe thee post-receive hook is not working. as i thought it would merge with the synced branch in a auto way. i always have to run git annex sync do get the new files or repo A in repo B. i know you can set something up with \"git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead\". but i thought if i set something up with the assistant this would do this out of the box. or i have a thinking error. do i need a pushing tranfer repo in the middle connected with tor to get this done? i thought it would be more easy. but if i dont even get this working local.... i have no idea where my error is. if its something technical or in my understanding.
