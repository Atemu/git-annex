Please, when filing a bug report, especially one that has the potential
to be a major data loss bug, provide enough information to reproduce the bug
report. This includes a version number, and ideally showing how to create a
new repository and configure it, from scratch, so that the bug occurs.

I suspect that what is happening here is, you don't have numcopies set to a
number >= mincopies. And there's code that only checks numcopies, with the
assumption that if it makes sure numcopies is satisfied, mincopies must be
satisfied since it's a smaller or equal number.

Of course, that's just a guess, but it was the first way I was able to
reproduce a behavior like you show.

I guess that's a bug, but it's not a major data loss bug since numcopies
defaults to 1 it will preserve at least that many. Also, it's not a very
wise configuration because mincopies is a new feature and if an older
version of git-annex, that does not support it, is used with this
repository, it will not know about mincopies and will only enforce
numcopies.
