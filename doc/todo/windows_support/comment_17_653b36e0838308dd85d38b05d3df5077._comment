> ... Postponed until old versions of git-annex-shell are less common

I find installation on windows unnecessarily complicated with current demand of using x86 git.  Not that it is impossible but it makes it more elaborate, even for old timers.
Would be nice if it was streamlined more.  I even wondered if there is a way to provide (additional) bundles which would come with git itself.  This way it could be just the git-annex installer to install all needed for working with git-annex (instead of this multistep process)
