The assistant web UI says: `SanityCheckerStartup crashed: /home/zerodogg/Delt/.git/annex/tmp/Sak_7.pdf: getFileStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)` with a «Restart thread»-button. Clicking said button merely makes the error re-appear. The file in question is a broken symlink. Deleting the symlink and then restarting the thread fixes the problem.

I'm not sure what causes said symlink to appear (which has the name of a file that does exist in the annex), but it has done so on several systems accross different distributions here (Fedora 20, Ubuntu 14.04, Archlinux). Perhaps an rsync copies over a symlink instead of a file?
