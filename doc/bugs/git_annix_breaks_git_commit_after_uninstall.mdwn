Sorry to be reporting another vague bug, this one interferes with my work unfortunately.

### Please describe the problem.
After uninstalling git-annix, running git commit returns the following error:

git: 'annex' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Install git-annex using the ubuntu ppa of fmarcier like so:

    sudo apt-get install git-annex

Then remove it:

    sudo apt-get remove git-annex

Then go to work in a git project, that is not in annex and has no relation to it. Add your changes and run commit:

    git add my-new-file
    git commit -m "added new file"

I expect it to confirm the file is committed, instead I get the error message:
  
    git: 'annex' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Ubuntu 13.04, using the PPA by marcier linked on the branchable website.
