ap-southeast-2 vs ap-southeast-1 must have something to do with this
problem.

I tried making a S3 remote with datacenter=ap-southeast-2 and it didn't
have this problem, and used s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com, so doesn't
seem that git-annex is getting the mapping to endpoints wrong.

I also tried forcing git-annex to use ap-southeast-1 instead of the right
datacenter, and I don't get a redirect, getting a file just fails in that
misconfiguration.

So, it seems there is something special about your bucket; git-annex thinks
it's in ap-southeast-1, S3 apparently redirects to somewhere else. Sounds
like the AWS interface shows you the bucket is located in ap-southeast-2?

This is looking more like a bug with the haskell-AWS library. If AWS can
send redirects here, it ought to follow them. It would be really helpful if
I had a way to reproduce the problem. Since your remote is encrypted
anyway, is there any chance you could generate AWS creds that I could use
to access that bucket to try to get files from it?

(The `copy --to cloud` didn't do anything because git-annex already thinks
the file is there (--force has no effect on copy --to).)
