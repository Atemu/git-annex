annex-checkuuid=false prevents the git config of a remote from being read.
So, the remoteGitConfig will be an empty config when that's set.

Only a few things use remoteGitConfig. Annex.Ssh uses it, but is not
impacted by the problem. 

And `git annex sync` looks at it to determine
if the remote is a FAT-formatted drive, and does updateInstead emulation.
So, that's broken for remotes with annex-checkuuid=false

The best thing would be to remove remoteGitConfig, to avoid such problems
in the future. --[[Joey]]
