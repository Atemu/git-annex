How about annex.dotfiles=true enables annexing dotfiles, but only
if annex.largefiles is set to something. Leave it up
to the user to configure annex.largefiles according to their use case.
And if the user neglects to annex.largefiles, this avoids blowing their foot
off by default.

annex.dotfiles could certainly go in the global `git-annex config`;
annex.largefiles would then make sense to be set in .gitattributes,
or also add support for storing in in `git-annex config` (which avoids
the syntatic hacks needed to shoehorn it into .gitattributes, and makes it
be repo-global the same as the annex.dotfiles config).
