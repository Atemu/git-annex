\"Remote url claiming iterates through remotes ordered by cost\" -- my web remote has lower cost than my dnanexus external special remote; the latter claims dx:// URLs.  But git-annex never seems to ask dnanexus to process dx:// URLs, even when I've manually set the URL to be present there.  Does the web remote always win, and if it can't handle a URL does git-annex then not try external special remotes?
