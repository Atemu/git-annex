It doesn't need to be installed into the system PATH; just the user PATH. Which you should be able to control.

Exactly how to do this surely varies, but here I have a `~/.bashrc` containing `PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH; export PATH` and I keep git-annex-shell in bin and it's available to eg \"ssh mybox git-annex-shell\"
