git-annex 0.10 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * In .gitattributes, the annex.numcopies attribute can be used
     to control the number of copies to retain of different types of files.
   * Bugfix: Always correctly handle gitattributes when in a subdirectory of
     the repository. (Had worked ok for ones like "*.mp3", but failed for
     ones like "dir/*".)
   * fsck: Fix warning about not enough copies of a file, when locations
     are known, but are not available in currently configured remotes.
   * precommit: Optimise to avoid calling git-check-attr more than once.
   * The git-annex-backend attribute has been renamed to annex.backend."""]]
