### Please describe the problem.

When git-annex assistant on Android setups up the DCIM repo a .gitignore file is dropped into place which ignores .thumbnails/* . Unfortunately this doesn't match .thumbnails/.thumbdata* - I have a 700MB file which matches this pattern.

I suspect that making the pattern in .gitignore just .thumbnails should resolve this.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Create a repo

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Nightly build for Android from yesterday (2013-11-16)
