It would be nice, but it adds quite a lot of complexity to have a --dry-run, and if I add it to just drop, the next bug is going to ask for get to have it..

I feel that the right approach is to add a --wanted, which could then be used with find to find files that are and are not wanted, according to the preferred content settings. To see what it would want to get: `git annex find --wanted --not --in .` To see what it would want to drop: `git annex find --not --wanted --in .`
