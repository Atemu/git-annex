Is this about HOME being on the FS, or about git-annex test being run
inside the FS?

It looks to me to be the latter, since the file it fails
on is in .git/annex/tmp

Might this filesystem have trouble with filenames with spaces,
particularly trailing spaces? That's kind of weird, and I've changed it so
it won't contain those spaces.

Also this line just after the FAIL seems relevant. (I suspect
the log might not have every line in the right order, like maybe stdout and
stderr are being read independantly and written to the log.)
