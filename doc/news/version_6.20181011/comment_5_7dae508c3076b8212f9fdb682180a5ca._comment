I'm not sure that a release announment is the best place to discuss a wide
variety of topics that only happen to have all been included or be released
to the release?

In fact, I'm pretty sure it's not.

I will say that if you are looking for information about any particular
line from the changelog for a release, a good technique is to run `git
blame CHANGELOG`, find the commit for that line, which is generally the
commit that made the change, and will have significantly more information
in the command message and/or bug report touched by that commit.
