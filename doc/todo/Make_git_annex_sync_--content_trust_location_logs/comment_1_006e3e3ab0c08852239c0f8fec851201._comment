Statting a file is typically much faster than
piping a request through to git, git reading complex files, and git-annex
parsing the result.

There may be a case, when annex.thin is set, where it has to hash the whole
file to determine if it's got the expected content. Normally this is
avoided by inode cache information though. And if it did, it would only
be slow once for that particular version of the file as it would cache its
informaton.

If you have a case where this is actually slow, please explain how I can
see it.
