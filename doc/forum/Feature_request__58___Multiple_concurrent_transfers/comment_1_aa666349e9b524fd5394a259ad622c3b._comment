I have been toying with \"external\" transfer handlers. Sometimes when I am dealing with very large files, it makes more sense to just copy the keys outside of git-annex, and then after they are copied, run fsck. Perhaps at some point there could be a way to have a transfer \"shim\" of some kind, for handling transfers.
