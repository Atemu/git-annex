This has the following problem: You run git pull. A file got deleted. git
deletes the file in the repository directory. That was the only copy of the
content, so it's now impossible to revert the deletion and get the file
back, which you're supposed to be able to do.

This is why git-annex has to either make a copy or hard link the file
away for safekeeping.

As already discussed in [[annex.thin without hardlinks]].
