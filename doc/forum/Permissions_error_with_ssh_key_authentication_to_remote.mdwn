I am using git-annex to set up a file distribution system with git commands as the interface. I have configured a unix user account with .ssh key so that calls to the git remote are authenticated automatically. I have set the ownership and permissions for that user account. I can ssh into the remote with that account no problem. But when I run `git annex get` to retrieve the source data from the annex, I get a typical permissions error. I have tried `chown'ing` and `chmod'ing` many combinations, but always get the same error. 
Looking for help to diagnose and fix this issue.  Let me know if there are other commands I can run to hone in.
