At least part of this sounds like [[direct_mode_assistant_in_subdir_confusion]]. The report is too confused for me to tell if that's the whole of the problem.

Note that git-annex stores files in git, so if it did something wrong, you can switch to indirect mode, and use regular git commands to check out a tree from before the problem occurred.
