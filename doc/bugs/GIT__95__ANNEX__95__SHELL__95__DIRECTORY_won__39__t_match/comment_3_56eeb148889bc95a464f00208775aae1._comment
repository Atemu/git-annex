Got it to happen at least (though I do not believe this is was caused me to investigate this)...

This works:

    ± git annex sync --content
    commit 
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
    
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    ok
    pull origin 
    ok

This gives the error:

    ± git annex sync -J4 --content
    /usr/local/bin/rrsync: SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND='git-annex-shell inannex .' is not rsync
    
      Unable to run git-annex-shell on remote .
    On branch master
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
    
    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    commit ok
    pull origin ok
