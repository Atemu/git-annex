I like the way btsync search for the peer. So if I need to sync my laptop and other family laptop both with a total different and changing network setup the two device found each other do NAT traversal if needed use relays but the end the two folders are synced. But its closed-source :( I like git and git-annex looks really great. I'm learning it now.

First I thought with xmpp I can sync files without ssh/rsync or other remote access to my devices just with two jabber account. Now I know I can't. :(

It would be just great to have some means to sync files without cloud just the two device. Without the ssh / rsync jut share some secret and the devices do the rest. :-o

Anyway thanks for hearing. I'm looking forward to know more about git-annex. Thank you for that sw. =-<>-=
