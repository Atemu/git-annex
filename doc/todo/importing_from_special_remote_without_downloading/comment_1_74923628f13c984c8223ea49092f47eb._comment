It would also be possible for listImportableContents to
return an url that can be used to publically download the content,
which git-annex could derive a URL key from (as well as recording the url).

If the ContentIdentifier is something globally unique or using some kind
of proprietary hashing (like an S3 version ID), it could be used to
construct a key. (Note that it would be possible for a remote to include its
UUID in the ContentIdentifier if it's not otherwise globally unique.)
