I got annex.stalldetection implemented yesterday without much drama. It was
a big patch, and it all worked on the first try. But ended up also spending
all of today working on it. After sleeping on it, I realized there were
several things I needed to improve. Including making a real
protocol that git-annex uses to talk to the helper `git-annex
transferrer` processes, to make it fairly future proof.
