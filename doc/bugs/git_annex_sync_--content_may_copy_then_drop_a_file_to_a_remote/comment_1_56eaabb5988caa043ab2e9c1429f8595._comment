A good bug report that I didn't get to for far too long..

I reproduced this fairly easily; both remotes set to be 
in the archive group and both set to use the "standard" preferred content
expression.

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/bench/local>git annex sync --content
	commit  ok
	copy file copy file (to hubic3...) 
	ok                      
	copy file copy file (to hubic2...) 
	ok                      
	drop hubic3 file ok

It wants to drop the file from hubic3 once it's present on hubic2,
since archive remotes only want files not on other archive remotes.

So, why does it send the file to hubic2, given that it's already in hubic3?

If I manually copy the file to one of the remotes, sync --content won't
send it to the other. So, I suspect it's getting a list of remotes that
want the file first, and then copying the file to all of them.

Aha, indeed:

	map put <$> filterM wantput lack

Fixed by making it check if each remote wants the file inside the loop,
rather than checking when getting the list of remotes to loop over.
