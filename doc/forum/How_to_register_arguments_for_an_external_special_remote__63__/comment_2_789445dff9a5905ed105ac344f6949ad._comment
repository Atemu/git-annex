I found out how to do it after reading his source code for the [Google Drive remote](github.com/Lykos153/git-annex-remote-gdrive).

Feel free to have a look around my remotes <github.com/cardoso-neto/git-annex-remote-manytars> <github.com/cardoso-neto/git-annex-remote-manyzips> which use his [helper module](github.com/Lykos153/AnnexRemote).

To summarize it, you should override __init__ and list your configs there.
