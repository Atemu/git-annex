### Please describe the problem.
I'm running git-annex on OSX 10.9.3. The problem is that during sync with an git-annex remote the system gets flooded with gpg-agent processes which are never stopped, eventually running out of user processes.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Any synchronization of a lot of files with a git-annex remote.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
5.20140517-g0aed6d9.

The problem did not appear on any older version.

### Please provide any additional information below.
