This will avoid the overhead of the smudge filter, when all the files
you're adding are ones you want stored in git, *not* in git-annex.

	git-annex add --force-small

I do think it would be possible for `git-annex add` to use the same method
whenever it adds non-large files. But it might have unwanted other effects,
since the way that manages to be fast is by avoding using `git add` and
having git-annex hash the file and add it to git itself. Opened
[[todo/speed_up_git_annex_add_of_small_files]] to consider this.

The only way to speed up `git add` is to disable the smudge filter, but then
all files you `git add` will be stored in git, not in git-annex. And
disabling the smudge filter also will prevent using unlocked annexed files.
(See [[todo/git_smudge_clean_interface_suboptiomal]] for background.)
