The first prerelease of git-annex was made ten years ago.
Taking a look back at 0.01, which I think only I ever used, it
had the commands add, get, drop, unannex, init, fix, and fromkey.
There were 2600 lines of code in all, which has increased 30-fold.

Later that week, 0.02 added the move command. I've been working recently
on fixing a [[tricky_problem|doc/todo/interruped_move_resume]] with
resuming interrupted moves. The move command has been surprisingly
subtle to get just right, since it turns out to not be as simple as a get
followed by a drop -- numcopies checks that would prevent a drop sometimes
need to be relaxed to allow a move. Maybe I've finally gotten it perfect
now. Probably not.
