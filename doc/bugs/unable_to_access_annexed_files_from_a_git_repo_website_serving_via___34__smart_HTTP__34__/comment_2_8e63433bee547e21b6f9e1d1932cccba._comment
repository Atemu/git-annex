ok... it helps to RTFM so I found the recommended way to host webcgi and the git-http-backend from the same site, just adjusted to not need `/git/` prefix:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
 ScriptAliasMatch \
        \"(?x)^/(.*/(HEAD | \
                        info/refs | \
                        .git/objects/(info/[^/]+ | \
                                 [0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38} | \
                                 pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}\.(pack|idx)) | \
                        git-(upload|receive)-pack))$\" \
        /usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend/$1
\"\"\"]]

So it seems that access with explicit `/.git` works now nicely with both git and git-annex.  Without `.git/` - only git works, I guess the same `config` access issue.  I guess `git-http-backend`, as any git command, can determine the root directory of the repository if invoked under .git or not.

I've installed current HEAD of git-annex (6.20180926+git93-gdc47dfe90... you don't have that commit since I am still carrying that LOCPATH patch for neurodebian) - indeed this one has user-agent reflected... probably could craft a rewrite rule for git-annex agent some time
