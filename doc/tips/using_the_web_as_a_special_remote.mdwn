The web can be used as a [[special_remote|special_remotes]] too.

	# git annex addurl http://example.com/video.mpeg
	addurl example.com_video.mpeg (downloading http://example.com/video.mpeg)
	########################################################## 100.0%
	ok

Now the file is downloaded, and has been added to the annex like any other
file. So it can be renamed, copied to other repositories, and so on.

Note that git-annex assumes that, if the web site does not 404, and has the
right file size, the file is still present on the web, and this counts as
one [[copy|copies]] of the file. So it will let you remove your last copy,
trusting it can be downloaded again:

	# git annex drop example.com_video.mpeg
	drop example.com_video.mpeg (checking http://example.com/video.mpeg) ok

If you don't [[trust]] the web to this degree, just let git-annex know:

	# git annex untrust web
	untrust web ok

With the result that it will hang onto files:

	# git annex drop example.com_video.mpeg
	drop example.com_video.mpeg (unsafe) 
	  Could only verify the existence of 0 out of 1 necessary copies
	  Also these untrusted repositories may contain the file:
	  	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001  -- web
	  (Use --force to override this check, or adjust annex.numcopies.)
	failed

You can also add urls to any file already in the annex:

	# git annex addurl --file my_cool_big_file http://example.com/cool_big_file
	addurl my_cool_big_file ok
	# git annex whereis my_cool_big_file
	whereis my_cool_big_file (2 copies) 
  	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
   	27a9510c-760a-11e1-b9a0-c731d2b77df9 -- here

To add a lot of urls at once, just list them all as parameters to
`git annex addurl`. 

If you're adding a bunch of related files to a directory, or just don't
like the default filenames generated by `addurl`, you can use `--pathdepth`
to specify how many parts of the url are put in the filename.
A positive number drops that many paths from the beginning, while a negative
number takes that many paths from the end.
