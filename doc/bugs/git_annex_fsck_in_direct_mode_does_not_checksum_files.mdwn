What steps will reproduce the problem?

Put some large files into a direct mode repository (so fsck time is noticeable).  git annex add them, commit, run git annex fsck.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expected: files are checksummed, which should take considerable amount of time for each file.  For reference, in indirect mode, fsck takes a while for files of ~1GB size.
Actually: in direct mode, git annex fsck goes through all of the files in an instant and prints OK for each. I believe the file content is not verified.
Multiple runs of git annex fsck do the same thing.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 4.20130405, Linux
