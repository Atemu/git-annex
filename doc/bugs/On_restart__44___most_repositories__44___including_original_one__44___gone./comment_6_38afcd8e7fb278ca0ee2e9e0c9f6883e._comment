FYI, if there's any relevance to the number of files in the annex, there are 1899 files in the annex at the moment, so that many in the one being deleted. The one it hung on, \"postgresql 9.0->9.1 upgrade process\" was indeed the last one that comes up in a find command, which I think means the most recently added to this dir.

Creating too many threads?
