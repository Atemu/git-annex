DataLad has been updated for the removal of `--include-dotfiles` in
the latest git-annex release (8.20200226), but there hasn't been a
DataLad release yet that includes that fix.  So I'd say the easiest
fix for now would be installing a developmental version of DataLad
(both `master` and `maint` have the fix).  I think downgrading your
git-annex version would be problematic because your repo has probably
already been auto-upgraded to v8.
