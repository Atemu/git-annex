I have two Ubuntu 13.10 boxes, both running 5.20131221 from the fmarier PPA.  They both have a repository with my XBMC library, and these repositories are synced together (they run on the same network).  Interestingly, one machine exhibits this behaviour and one doesn't.  The only obvious relevant difference is that the kernel versions are slightly different: the one that behaves properly is running 

3.11.0-15-generic #23-Ubuntu SMP Mon Dec 9 18:17:04 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

The one where the assistant is running at full CPU is on 

3.11.0-14-generic #21-Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov 12 17:04:55 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I'm not sure if this is significant or why the kernels are different versions (both machines are fully updated).

I would like to try and help debug this problem if possible.  Please let me know if there is any diagnostic output I can provide that will help.
