What steps will reproduce the problem?
In the git-annex tree,

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

One would expect git-annex to be installed in the configured prefix. Unfortunately, make tries to rebuild the "all" target before "install". This fails (presumably) due to incorrect environment state,

    ghc -O2 -Wall -ignore-package monads-fd -ignore-package monads-tf -outputdir tmp -IUtility -DWITH_ASSISTANT -DWITH_S3 -DWITH_INOTIFY --make git-annex Utility/libdiskfree.o
    
    Utility/FileSystemEncoding.hs:17:8:
        Could not find module `Data.Bits.Utils':
          Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
    make: *** [git-annex] Error 1

Removing "all" from the dependencies of "install" allows the process to run to completion, although this is clearly not a satisfactory solution.
