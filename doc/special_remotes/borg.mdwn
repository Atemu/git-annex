This special remote type accesses annexed files stored in a
[borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/) repository.

Unlike most special remotes, git-annex cannot be used to store annexed
files in this special remote. You store files by using borg as usual, to
back up the git-annex repository. Then `git-annex sync` will learn about
the annexed files that are stored in the borg repository.

## configuration

These parameters can be passed to `git annex initremote` to configure the
remote:

* `borgrepo` - The location of a borg repository, eg a path, or
  `user@host:path` for ssh access.

* `scan` - The path, within the borg repository, to scan for
  annex object files. This can be the path to a git-annex repository,
  or perhaps a non-encrypted special remote, or a path that contains
  several repositories.

  Information about all annex objects in the path will be
  added to the git-annex branch when syncing with the borg repository.
  So, it's best to avoid a path that contains object files for unrelated
  git-annex repositories.

## setup example

	# borg init --encryption=keyfile /path/to/borgrepo
	# git annex initremote borg type=borg borgrepo=/path/to/borgrepo scan=`pwd`
	# borg create /path/to/borgrepo `pwd`::{now}
	# git annex sync borg
