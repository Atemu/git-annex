I've often thought it would be handy to have a preferred content expression and a requested files list that work together. Which is, I think, similar to what you're saying?

So you could do something like \"git annex wanted . --request <somefile>\" which would add it to a list of wanted files, that overrides the preferred content. Then you'd remove them also.

Use case for this would be requesting a file. Syncing the request to, say, a usb. Plugging that usb in somewhere else later, and having those files be automatically transferred. Then when the file reaches the destination it's dropped.

I guess this is possible already with the wanted expressions? What would that look like?
