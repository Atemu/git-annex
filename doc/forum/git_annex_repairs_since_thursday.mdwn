I have not tried to get git annex to work in a bit. My troubles of recovering this annex repo have been documented here, here and here. On Thurs day I thought I give it another try. Since Thursday it tries to repair two out of three repos: my local repo on my laptop and my repo on an external harddrive I have. The b2 special remote repo appears to be fine, or not checked, I'm not sure.

What can I do, to get it working again?

P.S.: In my mind this setup should work like this: I want to move contents from my laptop to the external hdd and to b2 so that there are two copies at all times. I want to use git annex so that I don't need to carry all that stuff around with me anymore, because space on my ssd is sparse.
