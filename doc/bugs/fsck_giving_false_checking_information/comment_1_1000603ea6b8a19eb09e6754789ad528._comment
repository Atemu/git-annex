In earlier versions I noticed that when checksumming it would give back \"fsck file (checksum...) ok\" instead of \"fsck file ok\", which is at least better than not differentiating. This should definitely be improved. Perhaps even clearer than the (checksum...) notice.

But still the incremental run not being incremental and not taking into account the schedule-limit seems strange.
