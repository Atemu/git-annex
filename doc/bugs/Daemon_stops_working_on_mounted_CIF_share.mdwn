### Please describe the problem.
If have a directory - mounted CIF share (windows server with domain). 
If i run "git annex assistant" or "git annex watch" daemon starts fine and works at first, but then after some time stops doing anything: no messages in .git/annex/daemon.log, process hangs in ps aux. 

If i try to "cat .git/annex/daemon.pid" I get "permission denied". And permission is denied for everyone: root, from other windows machines, etc. 

If i then kill daemon process and start daemon again everything repeats.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Standalone git-annex 5.20140421-g515d251 on CentOS 6.5
