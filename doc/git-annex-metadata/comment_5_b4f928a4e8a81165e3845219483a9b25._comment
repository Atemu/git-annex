I think I added that line to the docs, and yes, it's not for git-annex metadata.  I'll clarify the page.

I'm not sure there is a well-defined way to set git-annex metadata via .gitattributes, given the different semantics of git-annex metadata (it's tied to timestamps, and is shared between all branches).  Maybe one could define some unified-metadata, which interprets git-annex metadata on an annexed file as implicitly setting .gitattributes for that file in that directory.
