\"what exactly happens when a file is excluded from a largefiles filter that takes longer\" -- looking in `.git/info/attributes`:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
* filter=annex
.* !filter

\"\"\"]]

i.e. _all_ files except dotfiles get passed through the clean/smudge filter defined in `.git/config`:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
[filter \"annex\"]
        smudge = git-annex smudge -- %f
        clean = git-annex smudge --clean -- %f
\"\"\"]]

It would be better if `git-annex` would only add unlocked files to .gitattributes (the one at the repo root), and remove them when they're locked.  This would also make it easier to find the unlocked files.
