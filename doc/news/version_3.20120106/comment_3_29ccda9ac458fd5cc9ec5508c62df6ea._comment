For what it's worth, the package `cabal-install` is pretty good for uploading packages to Hackages, among other things. It allows users to configure their username/password, and then making a release to Hackage is as simple as running:

    cabal upload foo-version.tar.gz

I use that to do releases of my stuff, too, and I'm quite happy. `cabal-install` has other features, too, of course.
