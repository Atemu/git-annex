I think it would be safe to make this change for WORM keys, which 
certianly don't need to generate the same key for 2 files with the same
name.

Less sure about URL keys, if two git-annex addurls versions pick different
keys for the same url, then there would be a merge conflict, where
currently there is not. I think I've addurled the same url in different
clones of a repo before, probably. Although addurl with and without --fast
or --relaxed also causes that problem and maybe it's not worth worrying
about it.
