msysgit does ship a ssh, in Git/bin/

So, when git-annex is installed on top of git, it installs its own ssh there, overwriting git's. Removing git-annex will then remove the ssh, and leave git w/o a ssh.
So, that's clearly wrong, although I was not able to reproduce git-annex's ssh being left behind. That must be what happened though, since git's ssh is not linked with libcrypto.dll.

In any case, there's no reason for git-annex to ship a ssh, since msysgit already does. So I will fix the bug that way.
