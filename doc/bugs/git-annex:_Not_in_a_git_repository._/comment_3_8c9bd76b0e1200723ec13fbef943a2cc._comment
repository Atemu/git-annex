What can happen is that `.config/git-annex/autostart` can list a repository that is somehow trashed. For example, I've seen this when I let the webapp make a repository, and then manually deleted the directory, while the webapp was running. The webapp then re-creates the directory, but it's not a valid git repo, just a mostly empty directory.

Tend to see this as user error though..
