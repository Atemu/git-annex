Can $field be a glob? i.e. *

I'm looking for the files to be organised to the last change date to *any* metadata, not a specific field.

For example, I may have added some vacation photos and set some metadata (location=Malta), a couple of months later, gone through and added metadata to some of them (person=Susan, event=Wedding Reception). 3 months later, I want to see a directory containing those that were initially added and metadata'd(?) with \"location=Malta\" and not touched since, and another showing those that had gotten additional metadata so I know which ones I should be looking at.
