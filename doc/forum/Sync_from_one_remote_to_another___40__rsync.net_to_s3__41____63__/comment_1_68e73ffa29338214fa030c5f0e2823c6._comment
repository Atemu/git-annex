I don't think there's currently a way to tell git-annex to tell rsync.net to copy to s3; see [[todo/transitive_transfers]].  But if you do the in-cloud copying yourself outside of git-annex, you can use [[`git-annex-import --no-content`|git-annex-import]] to record in git-annex the location of the copies in s3.  See also [[todo/sync_fast_import]].
