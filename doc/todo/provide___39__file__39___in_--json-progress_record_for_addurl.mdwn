Would it be sensibly easy to provide "file" field in progress json records for addurl?  I guess in any usecase (provided or deduced from url filename) it should be known at that stage.
ATM it is just "null" and I guess (didn't try ATM) it would be impossible to associate particular progress reports with corresponding files in the `--batch -J` mode

[[!format sh """
$> git annex addurl --file bigone --json --json-progress https://s3.amazonaws.com/fcp-indi/data/Projects/ABIDE_Initiative/Outputs/freesurfer/5.1/UCLA_1_0051257/mri/T1.mgz
