Even better would be an option to automatically sync copy the content referenced by any pushed commits, to a specified remote; and/or, to automatically `git-annex-get` content referenced by any pulled commits.  Then can use git-annex like git without needing to remember to `git-annex-sync`.  [[todo/operate_on_files_affected_by_a_commit_range]] could be useful in implementing the hooks.
