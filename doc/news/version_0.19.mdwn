git-annex 0.19 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * configure: Support using the uuidgen command if the uuid command is
     not available.
   * Allow --exclude to be specified more than once.
   * There are now three levels of repository trust.
   * untrust: Now marks the current repository as untrusted.
   * semitrust: Now restores the default trust level. (What untrust used to do.)
   * fsck, drop: Take untrusted repositories into account.
   * Bugfix: Files were copied from trusted remotes first even if their
     annex.cost was higher than other remotes.
   * Improved temp file handling. Transfers of content can now be resumed
     from temp files later; the resume does not have to be the immediate
     next git-annex run.
   * unused: Include partially transferred content in the list.
   * Bugfix: Running a second git-annex while a first has a transfer in
     progress no longer deletes the first processes's temp file."""]]
