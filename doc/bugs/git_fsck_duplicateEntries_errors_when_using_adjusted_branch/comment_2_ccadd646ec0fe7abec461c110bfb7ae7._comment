Something more is involved than git annex add and sync on an adjusted
branch, because when I try that the problem does not appear.
(Also tried on OSX in case it was somehow OSX specific.)

I see that the mode of the files in the problem tree you showed
is 120000, which tells me that tree is one that was committed to the master
branch, not the adjusted unlocked branch. That suggests that the problem is
in reverseAdjustedTree. But I don't think I will be able to find it by
staring at the code; I need a way to reproduce the problem.

What *might* help is if you can show the full directory tree in the
repository (with names mangled for privacy as needed). It may be that it's
somehow caused by adding a file at a particular location in the tree,
since a lot of the complication in the code is around handling such things.
