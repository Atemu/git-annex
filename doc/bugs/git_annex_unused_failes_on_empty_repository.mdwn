[[!meta title="`git annex unused` fails on empty repository"]]

The ``git annex unused`` command fails on a git-annex repository, if there are no objects yet:

    $ git annex unused
    unused  (checking for unused data...) 
    git-annex: /tmp/annextest/other_annex/.git/annex/objects: getDirectoryContents: does not exist (No such file or directory) 
    git-annex: 1 failed
    $

This can give a user (especially one that wants to try out simple commands with his newly created repo) the impression that something is wrong, while it is not. I'd expect the program either to show the same message ``git annex unused`` shows when everything is ok (since it is, or should be).

This can be a bug in the ``unused`` subcommand (that fails to accept the absence of an objects directory) or in the ``init`` subcommand (that fails to create it).
