Are either the USB drive or the ssh remote configured to be in the archive or smallarchive group?

If not, there was a recent change to how archive directories are handled, which would explain this behavior:

<pre>
  * Adjust preferred content expressions so that content in archive
    directories is preferred until it has reached an archive or smallarchive
    repository.
</pre>

The solution would be to make the USB drive be in the archive group, probably..
