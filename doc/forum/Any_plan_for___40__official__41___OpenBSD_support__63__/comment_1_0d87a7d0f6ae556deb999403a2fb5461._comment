People have told me once or twice that they were able to build git-annex on
openbsd using stack. If it doesn't build, file a bug (unless it's clearly a
toolchain/OS issue).

If someone can confirm it builds, I could try to set up an openbsd
autobuilder in a VM. But I have no openbsd experience so would probably
need some hand-holding.
