### Please describe the problem.

Automatic upgrade fails with error messages like

git-annex: Repository /data/images is at unsupported version 7. Automatic upgrade exception! roebi.jpg: getSymbolicLinkStatus: does not exist (No such file or directory)

This is the second repository where this happens.

The problem occurs when issuing any git-annex command from the command line, like git-annex add, sync etc.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

not clear when this happens. Both, the file and the symlink exist. 
The file is symlinked from two directories within git-annex.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Arch Linux
git-annex version: 8.20200226-g8bc393a63

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
