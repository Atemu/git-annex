As yes, I missed that you also had an example of fsck --key as well as fsck
of a file in the working tree with a dead key.

I think the same basic reasoning applies for fsck --key as for fscking a
worktree file. The user appears to be particularly interested in that key,
so fsck should tell them about the obious problem that it has no remaining
content. It's not like --all.
