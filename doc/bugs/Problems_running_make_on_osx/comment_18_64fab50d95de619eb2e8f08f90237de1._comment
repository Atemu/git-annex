I think I have figured out why 

    ### Failure in: 1:blackbox:3:git-annex unannex:1:with content
    foo is not a symlink

It goes back to the this piece of code (in test.hs)

    copyrepo :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO FilePath
    copyrepo old new = do
            cleanup new
            ensuretmpdir
            Utility.boolSystem \"cp\" [\"-pr\", old, new] @? \"cp -pr failed\"

It seems that on OSX it does not preserve the symbolic link information, basically cp is not gnu cp on OSX, doing a \"cp -a SOURCE DEST\" seem's to the right thing on OSX. I tried it out on my archlinux workstation by replacing *-pr* with just *-a* and all the tests passed on archlinux.

I'm not sure what the implications would be with changing the test with changing the cp command.
