One piece of information that's sometimes useful, but not always, is to get a count of keys present in another remote plus the size of the remote.

Thus, I could verify that some repos are empty, archive repos have every single file, etc etc.

I still think that info is best suited for `git annex info name/UUID` as it's more volatile than what `git annex vicfg` displays.
