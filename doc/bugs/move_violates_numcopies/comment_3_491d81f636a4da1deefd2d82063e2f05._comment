I agree with anarcat.

The core use case of git-annex is to maintain sets of known-good data. This function mainly relies on a directory structure, checksums, a defined minimum of copies, and tracking where they are. I would never have assumed that I would be able to get git-annex to go below the mincopies, at least not unless I was deep into the innards of git-annex and/or abusing --force or the like.
