Oh, that format is unfortunately what git-remote-gcrypt uses:

       rsync URIs
              Note that the URI format for the rsync backend  is,  regretably,
              non-standard.    git-remote-gcrypt  uses  rsync://user@host:path
              whereas   plain   rsync   uses    either    user@host:path    or
              rsync://user@host/path.

Also, all git-annex commands crash due to the malformed/nonstandard url.
Even git-annex init, or other things that don't need to access the remote at all.

So this definitely needs fixing, to at least not crash on that.
