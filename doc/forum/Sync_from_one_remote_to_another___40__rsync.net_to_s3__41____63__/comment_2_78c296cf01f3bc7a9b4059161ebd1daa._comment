Okay so it sounds like if I want to store stuff on rsync.net and s3, and use a faster connection, I'll need to set up a VPS instance as a transfer remote. Then I upload files from my local machine to the transfer remote, and have it upload to rsync.net and S3. Are there any other options that I'm overlooking?
