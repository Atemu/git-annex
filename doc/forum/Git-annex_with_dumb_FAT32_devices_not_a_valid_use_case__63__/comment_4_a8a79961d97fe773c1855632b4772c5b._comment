I see no reason to add such filename munging to git-annex, controlling the
names of files in the working tree is well out of its scope. It could be in
scope for git, but more likely, if this is a problem for you, you need to
set up your own policy for what filenames are allowed in your repository,
and use existing facilities to enforce it (git hooks, etc).
