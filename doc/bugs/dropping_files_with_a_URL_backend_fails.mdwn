I was trying out the example with the walkthrough using_the_URL_backend. I tried dropping files that I had after doing an "git annex get ." which have the URL backend associated with the files it fails with


<pre>
[jtang@lenny gc]$ git annex drop -v curl-7.21.4.tar.gz
drop curl-7.21.4.tar.gz
failed
git-annex: 1 failed
</pre>

At first I thought it was just my OSX machine not having the coreutils stuff load up before the BSD utils, but I then tried the same thing on my archlinux machine and it showed the same behaviour, that is I could not drop a file with the URL backend as shown in the walkthrough.
