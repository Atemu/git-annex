I stuggled with naming this option. I did consider something 
with "config" (redundant with other configs), or "parameter"
or "option" (redundant with other options). It was 
--describe-other-params for a while but that was too long to type.

--help would be the best name, but tying it into the main option parser is
impractical; amoung other things it would make tab completion need to
somehow run external special remotes to get a list of their parameters!

The mnemonic for --whatelse, such as it is: You've gotten at least as
far as type= (without which it won't work and will prompt for that),
and want to know what else you can configure.
