That's all I get back from the underlying library. I have asked the library's author to propigate up the actual error message from the XMPP server if possible. The only other information I could provide is which host and port it tried to connect to. I've added that to the error message.

We recently tracked a \"AuthenticationFailure\" error back to a bug in the ejabberd server's implementation of SCRAM. If jabber.ccc.de is using ejabberd, it needs to be upgraded. See <https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-1632>
