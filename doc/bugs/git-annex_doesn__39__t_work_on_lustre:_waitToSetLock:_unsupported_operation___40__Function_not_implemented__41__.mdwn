### Please describe the problem.

Attempt to add files to annex leads to

     git-annex: waitToSetLock: unsupported operation (Function not implemented)

Here is the log from  git annex test : <http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/git_annex_test_lustre.txt>

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

5.20150731-g41f79f2  OS probably CentOS (I am just channeling the report -- don't shoot the messanger)
