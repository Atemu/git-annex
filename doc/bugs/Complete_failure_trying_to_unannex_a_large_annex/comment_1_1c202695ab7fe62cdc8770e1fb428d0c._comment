You seem to have a corrupt .git/index file, or .git/annex/index, or maybe a whole corrupt git repository. I'm not sure. I'd start by running `git fsck`, and if that's ok, remove `.git/annex/index` and `.git/annex/index.lck`. git-annex will recover from that automatically. If that still doesn't help, you might need to delete .git/index and do some reset to get it back.

I don't see much evidence of an actual bug here, just bad data that is somehow on disk.
