   * Fix use of annex.diskreserve config setting.
   * Directory special remotes now check annex.diskreserve.
   * Support git's core.sharedRepository configuration.
   * Add annex.http-headers and annex.http-headers-command config
     settings, to allow custom headers to be sent with all HTTP requests.
     (Requested by the Internet Archive)
   * uninit: Clear annex.uuid from .git/config. Closes: #[670639](http://bugs.debian.org/670639)
   * Added shared cipher mode to encryptable special remotes. This option
     avoids gpg key distribution, at the expense of flexability, and with
     the requirement that all clones of the git repository be equally trusted."""]]
