Well I installed the 1 Nov release from the tarball and then it picked up the pair request from the other system.  I don't know if it was a bug in the previous version or something to do with the PPA.  It's weird that the assistant just wasn't doing anything about the pair request it received.

Thanks for your work on git-annex assistant.
