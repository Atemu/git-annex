Ran git-annex copy --to origin -J4 in a repo with 100k files. origin was a
local git repo. After all the files were transferred, it died:

	copy bar (to origin...) (checksum...) ok
	git-annex: git: createProcess: fork: resource exhausted (Resource temporarily unavailable)
	-exit 1

.git/annex/journal/ had 76k files in it. git-annex merge dealt with it
without a problem. --[[Joey]]

> This is reproducible, and the second time was with slightly fewer files,
