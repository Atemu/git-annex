What kind of NAS is it, and how did you install git-annex? In particular,
how did you arrange for git-annex-shell to be in PATH when sshing into the
NAS?

My guess is that you have done something that is causing git-annex-shell to
not be run with the versions of libraries it needs. Normally its wrapper
script sets this up.
