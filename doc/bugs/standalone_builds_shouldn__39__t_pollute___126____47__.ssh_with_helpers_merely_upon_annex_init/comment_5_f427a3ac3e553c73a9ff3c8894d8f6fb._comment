There's no reason for git-annex-standalone.deb's git-annex to
set up any of these wrappers, anywhere. That deb installs git-annex onto
the system PATH, so none of these workarounds for it not being installed on
the system path are needed.

The `GIT_ANNEX_PACKAGE_INSTALL` variable is supposed to prevent that. It's
set by debian/rules, since 5.20151116.
