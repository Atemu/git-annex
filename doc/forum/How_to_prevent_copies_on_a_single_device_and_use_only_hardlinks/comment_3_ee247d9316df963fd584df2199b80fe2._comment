I again don't have a full answer, but maybe you could customize git's [post-checkout hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_post_checkout)?  (You'd need to still call the hook that git-annex installs.)

Also, I've thrown together a [[FUSE filesystem|https://github.com/broadinstitute/viral-ngs/blob/is-dx-benchmarks/tools/git-annex-remotes/git-annex-on-demand.py]] that fetches git-annexed files on demand, maybe that could be adapted.  It only works with locked files and symlinks though.

What is the reason you don't want to use locked files?   You can have different [[worktrees|tips/Using_git-worktree_with_annex]] with symlinks of locked files pointing into the same annex.
