i hacked my way around this problem with this crazy commandline:

    URL=www.youtube.com/user/WHATEVER/videos # or playlist or whatever
    youtube-dl --dump-json --flat-playlist $URL | jq -r '.id' | sed 's_^_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_' > urls.txt
    git -c annex.security.allowed-http-addresses=all annex  addurl --batch < urls.txt

It's idiotic that youtube removed support for standard stuff, but that's the name of the game these days. Maybe git-annex could delegate this to youtube-dl? --[[anarcat]]
