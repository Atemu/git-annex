What is the last line printed before this error message?

My preliminary analysis is that it is checking the sizes of stale files in .git/annex/tmp, and could fail if a temp file was deleted just as it was running.
But if so it would be unlikely to happen every time `git annex status` is run. Or even if it did happen every time (perhaps because you appear to be running the git-annex assistant and it might be adding a lot of files in the background), the filename in the error message would be different every time. I have just committed a fix for that problem to git, but am not 100% sure it's really the problem that you're seeing.
