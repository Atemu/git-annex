There's been an open feature request on the haskell aws
for 5 years to support glacier <https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/81>
at this point I am doubtful anything will ever happen there.

The most likely approach seems to be to use the amazonka library, which
supports S3 with a Glacier lifecycle. git-annex's S3 remote could be
rewritten to use that.

I think it should be possible to set up a S3 bucket and configure it with
some web tool to have a Glacier lifecycle, and then use the existing
git-annex S3 support to access it. Except for the problem documented at
[[todo/wishlist__58___Restore_s3_files_moved_to_Glacier]].
