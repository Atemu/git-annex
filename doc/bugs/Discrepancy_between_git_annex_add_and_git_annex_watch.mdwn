### Please describe the problem.

`git annex add` does not add dotfiles (as per the man page) while `git annex watch` does (nothing on the man page). It's not a bug, but rather a surprise (at least to me).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

[[!format sh """
git init dotfiles
cd dotfiles
git annex init "my dotfiles"
echo test > test.txt
echo dottest > .dotest.txt
git annex add
git commit -a -m "initial dots"
git annex whereis .dotest.txt # no answer, as expected
git annex watch
git annex whereis .dotest.txt # answers that .dotest.txt is here
"""]]

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version: 4.20131101, ubuntu 12.04 with all updates.

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
