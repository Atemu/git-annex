Hello all,

I work for a company that produces books using InDesign and marketing assets for these books in Photoshop/Illustrator.

What we're ultimately looking for is a system that allows us to make changes (primarily to the books) and log the changes to the file so we can keep track of what has been edited when.

Ideally, we'd also be able to pull up an older version of the file if needed. So if we have 10 commits and are on commit #10, we could pull up commit #7 if needed and see that file as it was back when it was committed the 7th time.

I hope I explained what I'm looking for clearly. Is this something git-annex could help wtih?

Thanks
