I'd really welcome an __sftp special remote__ because SFTP it is the only officially allowed way for our institution to exchange data with external collaborators and I had no luck using the [gvfs](https://github.com/grawity/code/blob/master/net/git-annex-remote-gvfs) approach. 

Even without an sftp special remote, it would be great to have some short walkthrough how to use SFTP with git-annex (if SFTP is currently actually possible with e.g. gvfs).
