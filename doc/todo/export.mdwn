`git annex export` corresponding to import. This might be useful for eg,
datalad. There are some requests to make eg a S3 bucket mirror the
filenames in the git annex repository, which seem out of scope, but
something simpler like this could be worth doing.

`git annex export --to remote files` would copy the files to the remote,
using the names in the working tree. For remotes like S3, it could add the
url of the exported file, so that another clone of the repo could use the
exported data.

Would this be able to reuse the existing `storeKey` interface, or would
there need to be a new interface in supported remotes?
