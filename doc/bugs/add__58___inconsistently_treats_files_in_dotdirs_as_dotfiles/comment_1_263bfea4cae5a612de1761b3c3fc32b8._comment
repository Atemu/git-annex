I think it's quite likely that most people consider files in dotdirs to be
dotfiles, most of the time. (.git/index is clearly not a dotfile,
.git/config probably is) The exact semantics of it are vague enough that
it's probably better to not consider them when it comes to this bug report.

The actual bug is not about whether .foo/bar is a dotfile, but about
inconsistent behavior adding it.

Avoiding treating them as dotfiles, even if they're broadly understood as
such would resolve the inconsistency.

Otoh, the inconsistency only arises when run inside a dot directory,
which is probably a fairly rare thing to do.
