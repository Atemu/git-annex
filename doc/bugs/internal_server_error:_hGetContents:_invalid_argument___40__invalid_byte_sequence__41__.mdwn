### Please describe the problem.

Some logs fail to be displayed, and instead of displaying parts of the log, no logs at all are displayed in the webapp.

The problem character is, I believe, a latin-1 encoded filename (as opposed to UTF-8).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

# downloads [this logfile](http://paste.anarc.at/daemon.log.1) and load the webapp.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20131105-g8efdc1a

### Please provide any additional information below.
