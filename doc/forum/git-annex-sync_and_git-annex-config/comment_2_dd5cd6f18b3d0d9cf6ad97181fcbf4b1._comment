I guess I was wondering if that could lead to some surprises, e.g. if someone changes `annex.largefiles` and this propagates to other users without them realizing.  E.g. I'd want [`annex.gitaddtoannex` and `annex.supportunlocked` added as `git-annex-config` settings](todo/additional_git-annex-config_settings__63__) so they get set when someone first clones a repo, but the prospect of someone silently changing these settings in my existing clone gives pause.
