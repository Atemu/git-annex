Seems the last few commits have borked 'cabal configure' on OSX with the following error message

<pre>
[jtang@laplace git-annex (master)]$ cabal configure 
Resolving dependencies...

Build/InstallDesktopFile.hs:19:8:
    Could not find module `Assistant.OSX'
    Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
</pre>

Looks like a missing module.
