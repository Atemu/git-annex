This would especially make sense when sending files to a trusted special remote, where the file may be the only copy.
Maybe, set the mtime of all files (and directories) in .git/annex/objects to some sentinel value after they're written, then check if the mtime still has that value before sending the file elsewhere?

If a special remote [[supports named pipes|todo/let_external_remotes_declare_support_for_named_pipes]], the verification could be done on-the-fly as the file is streamed to the remote.
