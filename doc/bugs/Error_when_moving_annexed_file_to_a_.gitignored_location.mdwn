I just noticed that if you move a git-annex symlink to a location ignored by git, it simply works.  Upon committing that change, however, part of git-annex's `fix` function apparently tries to `git-add` the symlink.  This fails because the new, ignored location requires a `git-add --force`.

Considering that git proper doesn't fail or warn, I think git-annex shouldn't either.

This is the error message:

	$ git mv annexed-file ignored-dir/
	$ git commit
	fix ignored-dir/annexed-file ok
	(Recording state in git...)
	The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
	ignored-dir
	Use -f if you really want to add them.
	fatal: no files added
	Command xargs ["-0","git","--git-dir=/home/[...]/repo/.git","--work-tree=/home/[...]/repo","add","--"] failed; exit code 123

	git-annex: user error (Command xargs ["-0","git","--git-dir=/home/[...]/repo/.git","--work-tree=/home/[...]/repo","add","--"] failed; exit code 123)
