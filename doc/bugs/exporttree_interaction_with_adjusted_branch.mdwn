When on an adjusted branch, git annex sync --content with an exportree
remote that  should commit changes, merge back to master, and then when
the remote's annex-tracking-branch is master, the updated master should be
exported to the remote.

I'm told there's a one sync lag in changes reaching the remote. Ie, it's
exporting to the remote before merging adjusted/master into master, or
something like that. Have not verified and it could be some other root
cause than that. --[[Joey]]
