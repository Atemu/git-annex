Well, you can edit files and make changes, but a view branch is not
your master branch. If you add a new file, or edit an existing file in
a view branch, nothing will update the master branch to add that new file
to it.

When you switch back to the master branch, or check out a new view
branch, your changes remain in the view branch. They're not lost,
because each view branch has its own name, and you can check out the branch
again. 

Although re-running `git annex view` will regenerate the view
branch, so losing your changes. (The old version of the branch will still
be preserved in git's reflog for a while.)

I'd say they're mostly for viewing, not editing, but there might be ways
to use them for editing given these constraints.
