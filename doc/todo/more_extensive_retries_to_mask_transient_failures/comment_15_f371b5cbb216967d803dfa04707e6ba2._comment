Some progress: All threads that `async` or `forkOS` starts are now
confirmed to get shut down when an async exception reaches the code that
uses them. All uses of SomeException are confirmed to not catch async
exceptions. All file opening is confirmed to bracket and close (except for
the lock pool).

Still to do:

* process things noted in comment #13
* data structures that get modified while an action is running and need
  to be cleaned up on an async exception (eg the lock pool)
