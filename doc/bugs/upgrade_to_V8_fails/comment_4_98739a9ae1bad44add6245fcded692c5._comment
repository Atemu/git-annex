I was able to reverse engineer the error message by deleting one of the
file in the git repository, but not staging the deletion.

That does not seem to match what you were saying about the symlink
existing, but perhaps it was upgrading some other repository where
the file was deleted, or very likely I am failing to understand what you
were trying to explain.

Since what I've fixed is the only way it could throw that exception, I'm
going to assume this bug is fixed, but if you try the next version of
git-annex and it still has the problem, do follow up.
