It *is* silly to use any version control system to synchronize
the artifacts of another version control system. By doing so, you throw
away a perfectly working version control system and have to deal with
merge conflicts between version A and version B of the version control
system artifacts. 

Uness you have some magical solution to that merge conflict problem,
there's no point in further discussion.
