git-annex uses cp --reflink=auto. So on a filesystem supporting COW file copies, like btrfs, `git annex get` will not use any disk space when getting from the same filesystem.

I do not like the idea of using hardlinks, because changing the file in one repository would change it in the other, which may not be desired.

[[union_mounting]] seems to cover this item pretty well, so I will close this as a duplicate.
