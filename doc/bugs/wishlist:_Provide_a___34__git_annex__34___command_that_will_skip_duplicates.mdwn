(Hi, this is paulproteus/Asheesh Laroia).

I've been enjoying using git-annex to archive my data.

It's great that, by using git-annex and the SHA1 backend, I get a space-saving kind of deduplication through the symbolic links.

My question is, is there a frontend by which I can look at some files and only store the ones that are not already in the repository? That would help me in terms of personal file organization.

It seems there is not, so this is a wishlist bug filed so that maybe such a thing might exist. What I would really like to do is:

 $ git annex add --no-add-if-already-present .
 $ git commit -m "Slurping in some photos I found on my old laptop hard drive"

And then I'd do something like:

 $ git clean -f

to remove the files that didn't get annexed in this run. That way, only one filename would ever point to a particular SHA1.

I want this because I have copies of various of mine (photos, in particular) scattered across various hard disks.

(I would be even happier for "git annex add --unlink-duplicates .")
