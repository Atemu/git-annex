   * checkpresentkey: Added --batch.

     representable in the current locale.

     present in annex/objects but didn't reach the work tree.
   * When initializing a v6 repo on a crippled filesystem, don't force it
     into direct mode.
   * Windows: Fix v6 unlocked files to actually work.
   * add, addurl, import, importfeed: When in a v6 repository on a crippled
     filesystem, add files unlocked.

     slashes."""]]
