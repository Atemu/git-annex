git-annex is designed to run in constant memory. It should never use a lot of memory.

What file causes the problem? You show git-annex whereis successfully processing 1wolf14.zip, so that file is apparently not the problem. It's probably the *next* file you told whereis to run on. You can get a file list with `git ls-files`

Apparently something bad is happening when it tries to calculate the key used by the problem file.

What does the file look like? You're using direct mode so it may or may not be a symlink. If it's a symlink, show it. If not, show the output of: `echo HEAD:./$filename | git cat-file --batch`

----

The stuff about \"dead symlinks\" etc is all a distraction AFAICS. git-annex allows you to remove content from your repository in multiple ways. That content could be present in another repository (git annex whereis would tell you), or the last copy of it could have been deleted. You can run \"git annex log\" on a file to show where the content was located historically.
