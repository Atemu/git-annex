I upgraded another one of my git-annex clones.  The upgrade worked fine (i.e.
according to the manual) on two other clones before, but this time something is
different.

After 'git pull' and 'git annex upgrade', which took a long time and seemed to
have succeeded, there are no staged changes in git.  Instead there are lots of
untracked directories in .git-annex.  Aside from that, nothing seems to be
wrong.

At the time I had git-annex version 0.20110329 and I've been using the SHA1
backend since version 1.
