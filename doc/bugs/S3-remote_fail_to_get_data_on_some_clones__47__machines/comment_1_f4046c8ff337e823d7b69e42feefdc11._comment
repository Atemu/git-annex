It certianly seems to have sent a request to *somewhere*,
since it gets back a response:

    [2020-02-21 16:20:09.596938] Response metadata: S3: request ID=<none>, x-amz-id-2=<none>

Kind of looks like that response is not the response that a S3 server
should generate, since it's missing the usual metadata.
