Not OSX specific; reproduced on Linux.

Instrumentation shows that removeInodeCaches is being called, when it
unannexes the annexed file. This is why a file has to have been added to
the repo to get the crash.

It's actually not necessary for removeInodeCaches to be called in a v5
repo, only in v6. If the code checked for v6 mode before writing to the
database, such problems would be avoided except for in v6 mode.

But, the actual fix is to make uninit close this and all other sqlite
db's before deleting the .git/annex directory.
