Just to see what happened, I re-added that same file in another directory manually (not with the assistant).

git annex whereis instantly showed that it was in all the other repositories.

I finally thought to try a \"git status\" -- it showed that with for the original copy of this I added, the actual symlink was never checked into git.

    annex$ git status
    # On branch master
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #	Movies/Music/Tanlines - All Of Me.flv
    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)
    annex$ 

This is probably all unrelated to the original topic of the bug -- I am not seeing the \"client repo starts pulling in archive content, dropping it from backup remote\" issue anymore.
