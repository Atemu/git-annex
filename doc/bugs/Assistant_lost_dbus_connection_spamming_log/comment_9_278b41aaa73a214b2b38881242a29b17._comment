I did some more testing today.

I have this message when using either git-annex assistant or git-annex webapp. When running the webapp, I can connect to its port, but there's no response from git-annex (either from a browser or when using telnet to send a simple \"GET / HTTP/1.0\").

The accept message comes every second, the dbus one very minute (didn't test long enough last time, sorry about that).
