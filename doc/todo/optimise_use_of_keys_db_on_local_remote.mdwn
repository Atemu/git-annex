I noticed a git-annex copy -J4 --to a local remote was opening and closing the
keysdb of the remote repository repeatedly. This probably slows it down
some.

Not immediately clear why, Remote.Git.onLocal reuses the same Annex state, so
should  keep the keysdbhandle open, unless something is closing it, but I
can't see what might be. --[[Joey]]
