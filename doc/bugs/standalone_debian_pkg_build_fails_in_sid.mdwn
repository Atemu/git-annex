### Please describe the problem.

Trying to build debian pkg from current master in sid which has newer ghc (8.4.3+dfsg1-4) to see if it would somehow affect [multiple ssh prompt/locking](http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/multiple_ssh_prompts__44___and_thread_blocked_indefinitely_in_an___63____63____63___transaction/) issue.  But build fails with unclear to me

[[!format sh """
OK (0.68s)
    addurl:                                               On branch master

OK (0.33s)

All 293 tests passed (264.37s)

So it is `All 293 tests passed (264.37s)` but then some additional test fails

Note that was 7.20181105+git134-gf39db41d2 and i386
