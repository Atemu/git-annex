I have a repository at rsync.net, even though following files are shown as unused I can not drop them.

Running unused,

    git annex unused --from cloud                                            
    unused cloud (checking for unused data...) (checking annex/direct/master...) 
      Some annexed data on cloud is not used by any files:
        NUMBER  KEY
        1       SHA256E-s4189547--43aef42540e7f50fc454ab3a2ce4aa28a13b57cccff725359cea0470eb88704b. Bir.mp3
        2       SHA256E-s853765--c0964d3af493d78b7b8393a2aefdd8c290390a03c8cb5cccdcac4647c0fc52a0. 1.jpg
        3       SHA256E-s8706267--e34988b70048a512ad0f431a2a91fa7dd553f96c2bd6caca0bcef928bdfafb93. 3.mp3
      (To see where data was previously used, try: git log --stat -S'KEY')
      
      To remove unwanted data: git-annex dropunused --from cloud NUMBER

show these then running,

    git annex dropunused 1-3 --force

reports ok for each drop operation but rerunning git annex unused --from cloud still shows these three files as unused. I am using git-annex on mac os x (current dmg) on a direct repo. I have similar problems dropping files on the current repo even though I drop unused they still show up as unused.
