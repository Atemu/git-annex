Indeed this is a bug.  Easy to see why, note that "3":

	locationLogFileKey path
	        -- Want only xx/yy/foo.log, not .log files in other places.
	        | length (splitDirectories (fromRawFilePath path)) /= 3 = Nothing

So this also affected some other things that use that. Including `git-annex log`,
potentially something to do with v2 upgrade (if a v2 repo could be tuned this way?),
and handling transitions set up by `git annex forget`.

(I also checked if annex.tune.objecthash1 similarly broke stuff that
enumerated .git/annex/objects, but that was handled ok already.)
