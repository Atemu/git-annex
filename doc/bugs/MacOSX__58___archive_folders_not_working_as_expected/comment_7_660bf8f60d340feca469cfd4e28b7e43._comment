Just tested with `7.20181106-g352f88226` on macOS 10.12.6. Archive groups work fine with v5 repo but do not work with a v7 repo. With a v7 repo content is synced, but content is never dropped from the source archive folder. If I disable assistant and run `git annex drop --auto` from the client repo this will in fact drop the files from the archive folder. With the v5 repo I get drop logs in daemon.log with the v7 repos I get no errors in the logs and also no drop logs.
