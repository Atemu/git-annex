git-annex development has been more or less back to normal for the past
several weeks, including getting on top of most of the recent backlog.

Today I'm finishing up a project that has taken half the week. The internal
remote interface uses Bool extensively, and avoided throwing exceptions,
and so it was not uncommon for access to a remote to fail and no reason be
given. There have been a number of bugs about one thing or anther over the
years, which have been fixed on an ad hoc basis without addressing the
underlying problem. Now it's all been changed to throw exceptions, so the
failure reason will always be displayed. Some tens of thousands of lines of
diffs later, it's almost done.
