I tried with/without --from still does not drop the files.

    git annex dropunused --from cloud 1-3 --force
    dropunused 1 (from cloud...) (gpg) ok
    dropunused 2 (from cloud...) ok
    dropunused 3 (from cloud...) ok
    (Recording state in git...)

still running unused shows the files as unused.
