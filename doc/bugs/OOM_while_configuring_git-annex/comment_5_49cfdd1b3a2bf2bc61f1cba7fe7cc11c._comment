I notice that you're using Setup configure. It turns out that for some
reason, Setup configure's dependency resolution fails to find available
solutions, where cabal configure will easly succeed without using much
memory. There's a bug filed about this now:
<https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2777>

So, use cabal configure, or downloading the cabal.config from stackage will
probably prevent this blowup by pinning all the package versions to
particular versions.

I don't think this can be fixed in git-annex, really. So will close this as
forwarded to the above cabal bug.
