When using

    git annex import --deduplicate -- ~/directory/to/import

would it be possible to output the keys for duplicate files? This would allow people to find where in the annex the files already exist.

e.g.

    import ~/directory/to/import/001.txt ok
    import ~/directory/to/import/002.txt ok
    import ~/directory/to/import/002_d.txt (duplicate SHA256E-s261--fb1230987ac123098...) ok
    import ~/directory/to/import/003.txt ok

Then you could use

    git log -S SHA256E-s261--fb1230987ac123098...

to find out where it is already.

Not sure if that is the nicest layout.. (or what it might break).
