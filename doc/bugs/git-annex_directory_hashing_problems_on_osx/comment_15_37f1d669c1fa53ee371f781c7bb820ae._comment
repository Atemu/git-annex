I also ran into problems on a case-insensitive HFS+ file system, it seems.  I
tried following the instructions in comment 12:

	1. Remove everything in .git-annex besides uuid.log and trust.log
	2. git annex fsck --fast
	3. Commit

However, I still see upper and lower case directories in .git-annex.  Did I
misunderstand that they should all be lower case now?
