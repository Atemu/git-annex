rsync on windows has been broken by the upgrade to a newer version of
cygwin. `rsync user@host:file file` opens the ssh connection, but hangs
up with a protocol error. Apparently it doesn't get even the protocol
version message from the server.

Problem doesn't seem to affect the bundled ssh, just rsync. --[[Joey]]
