As a quick fix, would it be possible to make each git-annex process create its own temp subdir under `.git/annex/othertmp/`, e.g. based on process ID, and use (and at the end clean up) only that?

Or, if that's not simple to do, add a config option to disable cleaning up `.git/annex/othertmp/` at shutdown?  I can clean it myself after all git-annex processes have finished.
