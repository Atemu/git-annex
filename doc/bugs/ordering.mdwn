One would expect "git annex get foo bar" to first retrieve foo, and then
bar. Actually though, it will operate on them in alphabetical order
(probably). This is annoying when you wanted to 1st list the most important
files to get. Maybe you'll run out of time before all can be gotten. The
workaround of course is to run "git annex get" twice.

This ordering comes from "git ls-files". git-annex passes it all the files
the user specified. This is a useful optimisation -- earlier it would
run "git ls-files" once per parameter, and so "git annex get *" could be
rather slow. But, it produces this ordering problem.
