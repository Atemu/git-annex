No, there are not.

I'd like to turn this question around. You, and others, seem to have low
expectations of git-annex's locking and handling of concurrency. Is there a
change to the documentation somewhere that would convey that git-annex
handles multiple concurrent operations, without stepping on each other's
toes, with extensive fine-grained locking at both the thread and file level?

Because I keep anwering what seems like the same question, over and over.
And I don't understand why people seem to expect the worst, it's kind of a
downer and it's tedious to keep having to reassure people. Is it
something I did? Is it a general expectation that concurrency is hard and
so everything will get it wrong? Is it specifically git certianly having
poor locking in several places notably around the index and assuming that
git-annex will inherit it?
