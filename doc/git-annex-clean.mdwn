# NAME

git-annex clean - git filter driver for git-annex

# SYNOPSIS

git annex clean

# DESCRIPTION

When git-annex is used as a git filter driver, this command is run
by git commands such as `git add`. It generates a file that
is added to the git repository and points to the git-annex object
containing the content of a large file.

To configure git to use git-annex as a git filter driver, place the
following in the .gitattributes file:

	* filter=annex
	.* !filter

The annex.largefiles config is consulted to decide if a given file should
be added to git as-is, or if its content are large enough to need to use
git-annex.
