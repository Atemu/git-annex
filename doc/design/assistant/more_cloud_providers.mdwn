Git-annex already supports storing large files in 
several cloud providers via [[special_remotes]].
More should be added, such as:

* Google drive (attractive because it's free, only 5 gb tho)
* Owncloud (has several [providers](http://owncloud.org/providers/);
  at least one provides 5 gb free; open DAV based API)
* OpenStack Swift (teh future)
* Box.com (it's free, and current method is hard to set up and a sorta
  shakey; a better method would be to use its API) **done**
* Dropbox? That would be ironic.. Via its API, presumably.
* [[Amazon Glacier|todo/special_remote_for_amazon_glacier]] **done**
* [nimbus.io](https://nimbus.io/) Fairly low prices ($0.06/GB);
  REST API; free software
