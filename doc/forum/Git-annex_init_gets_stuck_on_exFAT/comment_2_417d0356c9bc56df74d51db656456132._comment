If you clone a v5 repository and then upgrade, you can get confusing output:

git annex upgrade
upgrade . 
  Detected a filesystem without fifo support.

  Disabling ssh connection caching.

  Detected a crippled filesystem.

  Disabling core.symlinks.
(merging origin/git-annex into git-annex...)
(recording state in git...)

  Enabling direct mode.
(v5 to v6...) (scanning for unlocked files...)
ok
(recording state in git...)

$ ls
largefile

$ git branch -a
* adjusted/master(unlocked)
  git-annex
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/git-annex
  remotes/origin/master

Although things seem fine, as adjusted branch is checked out.
