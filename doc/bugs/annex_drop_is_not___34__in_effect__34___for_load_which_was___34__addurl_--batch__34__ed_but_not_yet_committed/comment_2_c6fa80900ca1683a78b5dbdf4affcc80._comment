ok, so it is non-fixable reality due to having separate 'annex COMMAND --batch' processes (instead of a single annex --batch process which could accept/carry different COMMANDs with their parameters... I think we had discussion somewhere before).
Ok -- I will workaround (actually for now I have worked around by collecting all files to be dropped and doing that after annex addurl process finishes, but dropkey --batch sounds better for this usecase)
