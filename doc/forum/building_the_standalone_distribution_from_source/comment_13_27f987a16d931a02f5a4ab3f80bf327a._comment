I checked my .bash_history and it was `conda create -n $myname python=3.8` the command used.

I just reran that and got the same result when I installed git-annex with `conda install -c conda-forge git-annex`.

I also noticed you made the standalone dist warning message much prettier. Thanks for that. However, you forgot the `--channel` argument in your suggested install script. Here is a copypasta of your current message:

# Standalone distribution of git-annex was installed, instead of the         #
# standard distribution, likely due to package conflicts in the target       #
# environment.  The standalone distribution may have issues (e.g. be slower, #
# or not pass the expected environment to some external programs);           #
# the standard distribution should be used when possible.                    #
# You can force installation of the standard version by adding =alldep* to   #
# the build string, e.g.                                                     #
# conda install git-annex=*=alldep*                                          #
