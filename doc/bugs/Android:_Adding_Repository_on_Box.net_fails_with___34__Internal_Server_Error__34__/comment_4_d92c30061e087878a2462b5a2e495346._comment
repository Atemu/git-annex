I can confirm the problem is now fixed.

Unfortunately a new problem has emerged with gpg that might be related to other open issues. I will try to investigate it further before opening a new ticket.

By the way thank you very much for your great work. I'm eager to see the new metadata framework in place. It sounds extremely interesting!
