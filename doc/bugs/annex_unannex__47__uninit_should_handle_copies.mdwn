Just starting using v3, even more awesome, thanks!

With git-annex, I take the habit to do copies of files without restriction, as they end up into (cheap) symlink copies.
However, if 2 copies are unannexed, only one is restored, the other becomes a broken symlink, so I kind of loose some information 
(my use case: I have a repo on which I recently started using annex, but most of the files, which i would want to be annexed, are only in git,
so my plan is to unninit this repo, delete the .git dir, and then annex everything, as I don't mind the history).
