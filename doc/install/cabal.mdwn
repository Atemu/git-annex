As a haskell package, git-annex can be installed using cabal. For example:

	cabal update
        cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin

The above downloads the latest release and installs it into a ~/bin/
directory, which you can put in your PATH.

But maybe you want something newer (or older). Then [[download]] the version
you want, and use cabal as follows inside its source tree:

	cabal update
	cabal configure
	cabal build
	cabal install --bindir=$HOME/bin
