It's not currently possible for two special remotes to have the same uuid,
because the remote.log is indexed by uuid, and so their configurations would
overlap, including the type= and remotetype= settings.

But I think in this case, that may not be a problem, it seems you have a
regular remote accessed via ssh, and you want to add a special remote with
the same uuid that transfers from the same remote using globus. This is
like accessing the same repo via two ssh remotes etc, should work ok.

You can pass uuid=whatever to git-annex initremote to force it to use the
same uuid as the ssh remote.

(Returning to the question of two special remotes with the same uuid,
supporting that would need some way to separate their configurations
in remote.log into different namespaces. Seems doable.)
