AFAICS there is no problem with GPG_AGENT_INFO being set while using tmux. The gpg agent works as usual and pops up a passphrase prompt window.

Is there something broken in your gpg agent that prevents it from working inside tmux, or working at all? In any case, this seems like a local misconfiruation problem and out of git-annex's scope anyway so I suppose I will close the bug.
