There's no difference between an unannexed file and a new file,
other than some old versions of the unannexed file in past revs of the git
history. 

So, this cannot be implemented. If it were, deleting an annexed
file and then putting a new file in its place with the same filename
(and perhaps content) would appear identical to the assistant as unannexing
a file, and it would not add it. But we absolutely want to add the
file back in that case.

Suggest that, if you want the assistant to not add files for a while, 
you temporarily stop it.
