Several things suggest now would be a good time to reorgaize the object
directory. This would be annex.version=2. It will be slightly painful for
all users, so this should be the *last* reorg in the forseeable future.

1. Remove colons from filenames, for [[bugs/fat_support]]

2. Add hashing, since some filesystems do suck (like er, fat at least :)
   [[forum/hashing_objects_directories]]
   (Also, may as well hash .git-annex/* while at it -- that's what
   really gets big.)

3. Add filesize metadata for [[bugs/free_space_checking]]. (Currently only
   present in WORM, and in an ad-hoc way.)

4. Perhaps use a generic format that will allow further metadata to be
   added later. For example,
   "bSHA1,s101111,kf3101c30bb23467deaec5d78c6daa71d395d1879"

   (Probably everything after ",k" should be part of the key, even if it
   contains the "," separator character. Otherwise an escaping mechanism
   would be needed.)

[[done]] now! 

Although [[bugs/free_space_checking]] is not quite there --[[Joey]]
