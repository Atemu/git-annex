It only fails with --incremental, and the only difference
is that the fsck database is opened and written that way.

Somehow, opening the database causes the encoding of the stderr handle to get
reset from the fileEncoding git-annex normally applies at startup to 
the defaut, which crashes on filenames that don't use the locale's
encoding.

What a strange side effect especially to find in haskell code!
It's some kind of bug in persistent that this happens.
I've filed a bug: <https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/issues/474>

I put in a workaround; I have it reset the encoding of the file handles
after opening the db.
