Subject: [PATCH] use android net.dns1 command instead of resolv.conf file

Android has no /etc/resolv.conf. Some might have /system/etc/resolv.conf,
but even that does not seem likely.

This is likely a little slow, but is at least fine for git-annex's uses,
since it only uses this library for occasional SRV lookups.
