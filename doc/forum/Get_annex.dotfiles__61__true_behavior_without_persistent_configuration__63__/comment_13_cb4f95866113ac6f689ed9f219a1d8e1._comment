Did it work?
I wonder why you got the standalone (nodep) git-annex build in your environment -- this should only happen when package conflicts prevent the normal package from getting installed.
When you create a fresh env with git-annex, which package version do you get?

\"don't have admin privileges, so I'm using the existing conda (v4.7.5) installation\" -- with [[install/conda]] you don't need admin privileges, you can get the [installer](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers) and install it in your own dir.
