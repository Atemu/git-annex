For invisibility to work, GTalk demands that every connected resource implements its \"shared status\" extension. Given that git-annex sets negative priority, this seems like a GTalk bug - it should ignore negative-priority resources when deciding whether it can be invisible - but it seems unlikely to be fixed.

We implement shared status in telepathy-gabble (mostly in src/conn-presence.c, tests in tests/twisted/presence/shared-status.py) if it's any help.
