In general, the --json output does include a "note" with any
available message about why an operation failed. 

Since wget outputs HTTP errors to stdout, there's no way to capture the actual
message for json, and so swiching to wget -nv won't improve the json.
(curl also outputs HTTP errors to stdout too, so it's no better)

Short of using a HTTP library for url downloads in --json mode,
I don't see a way to fix this. It would not be hard to use a HTTP library
and propagate the HTTP errors into the json "note", but it might be hard to
get resumption of partial downloads to work as well with a HTTP library as
it works with wget.
