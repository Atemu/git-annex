There is not yet a pre-built Docker image for git-annex. However, it's
easy to add it to an image.

For example:

	docker run -i -t joeyh/debian-unstable apt-get install git-annex

# autobuilders

The git-annex Linux autobuilds are built using a Docker container.
If you'd like to set up your own autobuilder in a Docker container,
the image that is used is not currently published, but you can build
a new image using [Propellor](http://joeyh.name/code/propellor). Just
install Propellor and add this to its `config.hs`:

[[!format haskell """
host hostname@"your.machine.net" = Just $ props
        & Docker.configured
        & Docker.docked container hostname "amd64-git-annex-builder"

container _ "amd64-git-annex-builder" = in Just $ Docker.containerFrom
	(image $ System (Debian Unstable) "amd64")
	[ Docker.inside $ props & GitAnnexBuilder.builder "amd64" "15 * * * *" False ]
"""]]

This will autobuild every hour at :15, and the autobuilt image will be
left inside the container in /home/builder/gitbuilder/out/
