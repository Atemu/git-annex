Finally got a chance to look into this.

The ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server has been set up wrong by the webapp. If you look at it, it'll contain a part like: command=\"GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_DIRECTORY=... ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell\"

That can't be used for rsync. If you delete that command= part, your remote should start working.
