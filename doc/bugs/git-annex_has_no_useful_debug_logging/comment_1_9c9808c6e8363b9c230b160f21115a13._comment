I guess that [[bugs/filenames_with_dots_and_spaces_can_not_be_exported]]
is the bug report about the actual failure, and lack of a useful error
message after the failure, and this bug is left as just a complaint about
lack  of debug logging.

I'm not sure what to do about this bug. I'm not going to go around adding debug
logging statement to git-annex at random until some arbitrary criteria is
reached at which point there is "enough" to close this bug. It kind of
follows that I either leave the bug open forever, which is useless, or
close it immediately. Do you have an alternative suggestion?
