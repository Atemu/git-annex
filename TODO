* bug when annexing files in a subdir of a git repo
* how to handle git mv file?
* if curl fails to download, git-annex crashes and does not complete
  further actions.. exception seems to somehow not get caught

* query remotes for their annex.uuid settings

* hook up LocationLog
* --push/--pull/--get/--want/--drop

* finish BackendUrl and BackendChecksum
