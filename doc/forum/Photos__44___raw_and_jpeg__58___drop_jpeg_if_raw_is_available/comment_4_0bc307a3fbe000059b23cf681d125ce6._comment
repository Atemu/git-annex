Hm.. if you want to just drop the JPGs which have known RAW versions, you can set some metadata to say it has a RAW version (again, I'd just set it to the key of the RAW as it makes it easier to get/find later) and then drop JPGs which have that field set.

    git annex metadata -s derived_from_raw=SHA256E-s[...].RAW DCIM_0001.JPG
    git annex drop --metadata 'derived_from_raw=*' --include '*.JPG'

Need to check the `--metadata` matching filter works as intended there..

Given your criteria is only \"file in the current directory with the same name, but different extension\", you could script the population of that metadata field.

This will drop the JPGs where you've indicated it has a RAW even if that RAW isn't present though. I'm not entirely sure what behavior you want..
