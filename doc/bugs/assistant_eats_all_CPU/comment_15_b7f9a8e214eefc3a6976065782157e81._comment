I am trying around with the assistant and webapp for a few months now.
I have rather large git annex repos and even switched from direct ones to indirect repos to increase performance. 

The issue I'm seeing is that when using the assistant or webapp it does the initial startupscan, but only consumes 99-100% of one of my cores and doesn't use significant io. It's stuck in this state for hours (12+) or even days. The only thing standing out in the logs is that it puts a lot of files into the queue. (I suspected a not yet synced backup remote to be the issue) I stopped syncing with it, but that didn't speed up the startupScan at all.

Some additional information:
Total file count: ~100000
Total size: ~500mb
SSD + i7 Quadcore running Ubuntu 13.10
Latest build from 2014-01-16 as standalone built.

Running git annex add && git annex sync from the cli returns within seconds 0.1s (no new files) and 10s (500-1000 new files).
Not understanding the main difference git annex add and git annex assistant (startupScan function) really have.

Thanks for your help.
