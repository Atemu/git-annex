Ok, the liftAnnex part of this is just because most of the webapp, including viewing logs, requires a repo to be set up, and it's not gotten past the early setup part where this happens before it, apparently, crashed because of the email misconfiguration problem.

So, I should really detect and deal with this rather annoyingly common misconfiguration of user's computers..
