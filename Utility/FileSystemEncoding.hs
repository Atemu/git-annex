 - So this function is not exported, but instead used by the few functions
 - that can usefully consume it.
 -
 - This use of unsafePerformIO is belived to be safe; GHC's interface
 - only allows doing this conversion with CStrings, and the CString buffer
 - is allocated, used, and deallocated within the call, with no side
 - effects.
