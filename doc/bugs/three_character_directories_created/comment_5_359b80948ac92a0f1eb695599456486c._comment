Clearly this can happen if the git-annex branch is merged into the master branch. I cannot think of any valid reason to want to do that. reset --hard git-annex would also do it; ditto.

Inclined to close this bug as user error; I'm pretty sure git-annex does not contain a bug that makes it merge in the git-annex branch on its own. Basically the only change that could be made to git-annex to prevent this kind of user error is to move the git-annex branch so it's not under refs/heads, and so is not a visible branch. But then `git push` would not push it either, which needs to happen.
