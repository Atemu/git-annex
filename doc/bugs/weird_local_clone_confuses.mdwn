If a local repo is cloned with "git clone orig/.git new", then git-annex in
new cannot see origin. 

the .git/config has "url=/.../orig/.git". Apparently git is ok with that
weird construction; probably it treats it as a bare git repo. But git-annex
just sees a directory w/o a .git subdir, and gives up.

Just tested, and the new support for bare repositories didn't solve this.
(Because config.bare is not set.)

I think this is not something git-annex should go out of its way to
support. [[done]]
