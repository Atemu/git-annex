I've added an arm build to the autobuilds in [[install/Linux_standalone]].

It's somewhat experimental:

* There are several arm architectures. This build is done on Debian armel,
  which uses EABI. It will not work on older arm systems whose kernels
  do not support EABI. (It's also little endian.)
* It relies on the system having a compatable version of glibc installed.
  This could be improved by finding a way to build a static binary
  (but glibc does not make that easy), or trick the linker into linking
  against a glibc shipped in the bundle. The problem with the latter
  is that glibc loads some support libraries at runtime.

I'll be interested to hear if this is useful. If it seems sufficiently
useful, I might try to add the webapp to the build, which would be somewhat
complicated, but doable (since I'm building using qemu, it can run a build
on amd64 first to get the TH splices).
