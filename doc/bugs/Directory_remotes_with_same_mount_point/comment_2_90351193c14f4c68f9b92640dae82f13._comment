I don't think this has anything to do with mount points being in common.
Consider that, a single disk with a git-annex repository, and 2 directory
special remotes all on it has everything under a common mount point. And
I'm pretty sure works. Also there's just nothing in the relevant code that
cares what the mount point is.

It looks to me like the inode was somehow not the same in the "list" stage
of the command as it was in the "import" stage, or the file that was seen
in the first stage was no longer present in the second stage. I don't see
how that could be a git-annex bug. It could, for example, happen if one SD
card was mounted there at the "list" stage, and then a different card got
mounted there at the "import" stage, or even if the SD card just got
unmounted in between the two stages.

I have not been able to replicate the problem either, using 2 removable
devices on the same mount point, 2 special remotes, etc. So you will have
to show me how to reproduce this if it's actually a bug.
