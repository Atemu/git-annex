Okay, where do I get the newest build? I cannot find a link to a packaged file at http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/amd64/

I'd rather not build it from master myself, as all the Haskell dependencies are not well supported on Arch linux. Thats why I switched from the git-annex package to the git-annex-bin package in AUR in the first place.
