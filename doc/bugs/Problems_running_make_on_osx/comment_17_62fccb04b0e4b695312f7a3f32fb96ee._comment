Yeap, that did the trick. I just tested a few separate OSX 10.6.6 systems and the tests are better behaved now, only 3 failures now.

So the tests behave better (at least we don't get resource fork errors any more)
 
 * after the commit c319a3 without modifying the system limits (of 266 procs per user)
 * without the commit c319a3 and when I increase the system process limits to as much as OSX allows

On all the systems I tested on, I'm down to 3 failures now.

<pre>
### Failure in: 1:blackbox:3:git-annex unannex:1:with content
foo is not a symlink
### Failure in: 1:blackbox:4:git-annex drop:0:no remotes
drop wrongly succeeded with no known copy of file
Cases: 30  Tried: 20  Errors: 0  Failures: 2add foo ok
ok
Cases: 30  Tried: 24  Errors: 0  Failures: 2  Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies of foo exist.
  Back it up with git-annex copy.
  Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies of sha1foo exist.
  Back it up with git-annex copy.
  Bad file size; moved to /Users/jtang/develop/git-annex/.t/tmprepo/.git/annex/bad/WORM:1297594011:20:foo

### Failure in: 1:blackbox:12:git-annex fsck:1
fsck failed to fail with content only available in untrusted (current) repository

  Back it up with git-annex copy.
  The following untrusted locations may also have copies:

  Only 1 of 2 trustworthy copies of sha1foo exist.
  Back it up with git-annex copy.

</pre>

It's the same set of failures across all the OSX systems that I have tested on. Now I just need to figure out why there are still these three failures.
