# NAME

git-annex get - make content of annexed files available

# SYNOPSIS

git annex get `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Makes the content of annexed files available in this repository. This
will involve copying them from a remote repository, or downloading them,
or transferring them from some kind of key-value store.

# OPTIONS

* `--auto`

  Rather than getting all files, get only files that don't yet have
  the desired number of copies, or that are preferred content of the
  repository. See [[git-annex-preferred-content]](1)

* `--from=remote`

  Normally git-annex will choose which remotes to get the content
  from. Use this option to specify which remote to use.

* `--all`

  Rather than specifying a filename or path to get, this option can be
  used to get all available versions of all files.

  This is the default behavior when running git-annex in a bare repository.

* `--unused`

  Operate on files found by last run of git-annex unused.

* `--key=keyname`

  Use this option to get a specified key.

* file matching options
 
  The [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to get.
