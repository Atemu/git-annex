It appears that currently there's no way to use the "path-style" method for accessing S3 buckets (as contrasted [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAPI.html) with the "virtual hosted-style" of bucket specification). Would it be possible to add an S3-special-remote configuration parameter to adjust the underlying S3 library's "s3RequestStyle" config parameter? I believe that the "PathStyle" value would be relevant to this specific request, as mentioned in the [S3 library README](https://github.com/aristidb/aws#frequently-asked-questions).

The virtual-hosted style of bucket specification involves a lot of DNS overhead. In my particular use case, I'm looking at running Ceph with a radosgw with S3 support, and in fact the Ceph documention [specifically indicates](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/s3/commons/#bucket-and-host-name) a preference for "path-style" bucket specification.
