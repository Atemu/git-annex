In the sandbox environment used by git-annex standalone, the gpg binary exists, but not gpg-agent (or gpgconf or other potentially needed binaries).  This causes problems when the host system provides a different version of gpg that does provide these programs.  E.g. git-annex-test crypto tests seem to (indirectly?) use gpg-agent.
