One follow-up comment, because it occurred to me I might have phrased
the bug inadequately. By «revert» I didn’t mean a revert in the
git-sense, but merely «checking out» a file from a selected commit.

But I think I can achieve this in direct mode on VFAT by doing «git
show upstream/branch~X:file > file», right? «git annex get file» then
gets the correct content, only that it will not place the content into
the indicated file until I do «git annex fsck». Maybe «git annex get»
could take this into account and have the content immediately stored
there.
