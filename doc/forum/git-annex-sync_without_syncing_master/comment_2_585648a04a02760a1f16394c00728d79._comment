Thank you!

Just to confirm then, `git-annex-merge` will

1. union merge any ref with basename `git-annex` onto `git-annex`
2. union merge `synced/$branch` onto `$branch` where `$branch` is the checked out branch

?

My goal is for all remotes to have a consistent view of where the annexed files are, without auto-merging any normal branches.

Is the process you described above the easiest way to achieve this?
