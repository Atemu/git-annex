Import tree + move --from --to would be equivilant functionality to import --to.
The directory you want to import "to" would be set up as a directory
special remote and import tree used on it.

However, it seems to me that if I wanted to accomplish this today, I'd
simply make a clone of my git-annex repository onto the external drive,
move the files I want into that clone (a cheap operation as it's the same
drive), and `git annex copy --to s3-remote`
