### Please describe the problem.

inability to quickly grep locally present files

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

run "git annex grep"

> i don't understand this request. just running `grep` will grep all the locally present files: sure there will be warnings, but you can use `2>/dev/null` to silence those. as for the suggested solution in comment, that greps for the filenames. please clarify the feature request here or this is [[invalid|done]]. --[[anarcat]]
