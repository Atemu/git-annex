When a file is moved to an archive directory, the assistant uploads it to
glacier correctly, but then fails to drop it locally, unless it was
started with `--trust-glacier`.

Since it just uploaded the file, it should be able to drop it, without
needing to trust glacier's inventory. Note that `git annex move` works.
