git-annex 0.20110417 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * bup is now supported as a special type of remote.
   * The data sent to special remotes (Amazon S3, bup, etc) can be encrypted
     using GPG for privacy.
   * Use lowercase hash directories for locationlog files, to avoid
     some issues with git on OSX with the mixed-case directories.
     No migration is needed; the old mixed case hash directories are still
     read; new information is written to the new directories.
   * Unused files on remotes, particulary special remotes, can now be
     identified and dropped, by using "--from remote" with git annex unused
     and git annex dropunused.
   * Clear up short option confusion between --from and --force (-f is now
     --from, and there is no short option for --force).
   * Add build depend on perlmagick so docs are consistently built.
     Closes: #[621410](http://bugs.debian.org/621410)
   * Add doc-base file. Closes: #[621408](http://bugs.debian.org/621408)
   * Periodically flush git command queue, to avoid boating memory usage
     too much.
   * Support "sha1" and "sha512" commands on FreeBSD, and allow building
     if any/all SHA commands are not available. Thanks, Fraser Tweedale"""]]
