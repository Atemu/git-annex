Indeed, see [[todo/add_a_git_backend]], where you and I have already discussed this idea. :)

With the new support for special remotes, which will be used by S3, it would be possible to make such a git repo, using bup, be a special remote. I think it would be pretty easy to implement now. Not a priority for me though.
