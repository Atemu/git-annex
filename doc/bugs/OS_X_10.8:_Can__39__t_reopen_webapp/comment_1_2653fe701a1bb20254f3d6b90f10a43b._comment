I have the same platform (os/x 10.8.4) and git-annex revision (4.20130723-ge023649) but am unable to reproduce this.
I may have seen it in the last couple of months (http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/wishlist:_simple_url_for_webapp/) but it now does not seem to be affecting me; joey's prescription works.

Additional info:

If I stop the daemon via the webapp menu, close the tab and start again via the app icon (in the Dock), I get the tab opening as expected.

Sometimes, if I have the assistant in an open tab and doubleclick the app icon again, I get another tab with the assistant in it and the same auth= string.
Other times, I don't. It's unclear to me what the difference is. Possibly relevant - the time that I saw the second tab appear was when the existing tab was left over from the machine being in sleep mode, but it was definitely responding to mouse clicks etc (ie not a 'dead' page) and the daemon was still running in the background. After stopping and starting, I never saw the second tab instance appear again.

Browser is chrome 28.0.1500.71.
