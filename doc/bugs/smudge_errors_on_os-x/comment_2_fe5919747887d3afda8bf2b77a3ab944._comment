Could it be that git is not finding git-annex in PATH to run it, or that
the binary in PATH is somehow broken?

I'm leaning toward the problem being something like that, because if git
was able to run git-annex and git-annex somehow failed, it would display an
error message. It seems as if git-annex is not being run.
