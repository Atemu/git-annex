Many commands do have an interface that works like that. For example
`git annex get --batch --json` has json output and does not stop when a get
fails.

So this comes down to specific behaviors of specific commands.
I've added --json to fromkey.

I don't think that setpresentkey can fail, unless there's a disk IO error
or something?

Any others?
