Location tracking tracks locations of keys, not of filenames or directory names (unless you use the WORM backend).  Are you sure you care if other people know what keys (checksums) exist on your non-shared system?   If you don't, you could keep the contents of different repos as unconnected/unrelated branches in the same git repo.
