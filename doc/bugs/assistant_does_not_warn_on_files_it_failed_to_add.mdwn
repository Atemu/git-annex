What steps will reproduce the problem?

Unable to reproduce as it seems to happen randomly, to very few files (4/250).

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I expect to see the assistant warn if it attempts to add a file which fails to add to the annex.
Instead, I see no output from the assistant, but lines like this in the log.

daemon.log.2:add Indie Game Stand/Deadly 30/Deadly30_MAC.zip (checksum...) failed
daemon.log.2:add Indie Game Stand/Wyv and Keep/xnafx40_redist.msi (checksum...) failed
daemon.log.2:add Indie Game Stand/Blueberry Garden/Blueberry_Garden_1.1.zip (checksum...) failed
daemon.log.2:add Indie Game Stand/Flatspace Bundle/fsmusicpack3setup.exe (checksum...) failed

There is no reason given for the failure in the log file. The assistant also never tries to add them again in normal running (but did add them when it was started again after a reboot).

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 4.20130314
OS: Arch Linux

Please provide any additional information below.

The assistant in this case is being used as nothing more than a way for me to see which files have been added (--verbose, --foreground and --debug with 'watch' outputs nothing..). No remotes or anything like that.
