hello,

thanks, this version works on debian squeeze lts, unlike the previous. this is very good news, and a fine piece of software!

I wonder: why do you depend on a minimum kernel version? for example, I have a NAS with a very old 2.6.16 embedded linux kernel which cannot be updated, and because of this, I'm stuck with an ancient git-annex version.
