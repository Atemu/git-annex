Here's the way I currently use XMPP (Google Talk) on my devices:

* I have a separate XMPP/Google account on each device (device1@gmail.com, device2@gmail.com, etc.). I keep them separate to protect the credentials of the other devices in case I lose one of the devices.
* I setup git-annex to sync with a \"friend\" and have device1@gmail.com and device2@gmail.com sync with each other.

I have three different repositories I'd like to manage with git-annex assistant:

 * R1: things I want everywhere
 * R2: things I only want on personal laptop and desktop
 * R3: things I only want on personal and work laptops

So it would be great if there was a way to easily keep things separate.
