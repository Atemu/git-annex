Appears that you already had an empty file in the repository. Since
git-annex deduplicates content, it used the content of that empty file
for the new file you added. The empty file was created in 2015 is a
giveaway.

Do note that many git-annex special remotes cannot preserve modes or
other metadata of files anyway, so after moving a file to a remote and
getting it back, the mode can be reset to default. 

The mode is not version controlled when you check a symlink into git,
because symlinks do not have
modes.. If you want to preserve execute bits, the only way to guarantee it
will happen is to add the file unlocked. Then git tracks the execute bit.
