git-annex 3.20120315 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * fsck: Fix up any broken links and misplaced content caused by the
     directory hash calculation bug fixed in the last release.
   * sync: Sync to lower cost remotes first.
   * status: Fixed to run in constant space.
   * status: More accurate display of sizes of tmp and bad keys.
   * unused: Now uses a bloom filter, and runs in constant space.
     Use of a bloom filter does mean it will not notice a small
     number of unused keys. For repos with up to half a million keys,
     it will miss one key in 1000.
   * Added annex.bloomcapacity and annex.bloomaccuracy, which can be
     adjusted as desired to tune the bloom filter.
   * status: Display amount of memory used by bloom filter, and
     detect when it's too small for the number of keys in a repository.
   * git-annex-shell: Runs hooks/annex-content after content is received
     or dropped.
   * Work around a bug in rsync (IMHO) introduced by openSUSE's SIP patch.
   * git-annex now behaves as git-annex-shell if symlinked to and run by that
     name. The Makefile sets this up, saving some 8 mb of installed size.
   * git-union-merge is a demo program, so it is no longer built by default."""]]
