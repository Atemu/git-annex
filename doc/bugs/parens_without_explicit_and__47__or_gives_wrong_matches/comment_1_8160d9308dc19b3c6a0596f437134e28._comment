Let's see, here's the equivilant after parsing:

	# ghci Utility/Matcher.hs
	-- foo and (bar or baz)
	ghci> generate [Operation "foo", And, Open, Operation "bar", Or, Operation "baz", Close]
	MAnd (MOp "foo") (MOr (MOp "bar") (MOp "baz"))
	-- foo (bar or baz)
	ghci> generate [Operation "foo", Open, Operation "bar", Or, Operation "baz", Close]
	MOr (MAnd (MOp "foo") (MOp "bar")) (MOp "baz")

So it's interpreting "foo (bar or baz) like "(foo and bar) or baz"
which is surely a bug.

Fixed.
