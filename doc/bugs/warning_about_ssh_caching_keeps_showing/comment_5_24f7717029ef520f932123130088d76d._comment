I think the idea with detecting at build time is that if git-annex is being
built on a platform where ssh doesn't support it, eg because it's not
openssh but some other ssh implementation, it might as well compile out
support rather than fail obscurely when it tries to use it. And it's
uncommon for the systems where a program is built and used to have
different ssh implementations, so runtime probing would only slow it
down. (git-annex makes similar assumptions about eg, `cp --reflink` being
supported or not, and I don't think it's very unusual to probe OS features
at compile time.)

The warning seems useful, because here we've discovered that you have been
building git-annex without support for ssh caching all along!

The way to disable the warning is to set annex.sshcaching=true
(after [[!commit a4909470688287fc0009eaf82dab2e108bd214f1]]).
