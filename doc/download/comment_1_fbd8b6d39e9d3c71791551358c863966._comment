I'm trying to package git annex for ArchLinux and NixOS. That task would be a *lot* easier, if there were proper release archives available for download. The Gitweb site offers to create snapshot tarballs on the fly, but those tarballs have a different SHA hash every time they're generated, so they cannot be used for the purposes of a distribution. A simple solution for this problem would be to enable snapshots in zip format (because zip files look the same every time they're generated).
