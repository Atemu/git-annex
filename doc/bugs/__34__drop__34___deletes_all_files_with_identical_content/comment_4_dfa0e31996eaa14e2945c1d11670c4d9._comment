Thanks, that's cool. Admittedly, I cannot think of too many scenarios, where there are two identical files without the user's knowloedge. And an even smaller subset of scenarios, where one would want to issue a \"drop\" on (only) one of these due to storage shortages. 



By the way, I LOVE git-annex.


PS: I just realized, that the same applies to the \"move\" command.
