Ok, I am tempted to close this bug if it only happens with an older version of msysgit. It really is looking like a bug in git, or in the msysgit port.

The \"crippled filesystem\" is normal on Windows. git-annex does not try to use symblic links on Windows, and so is limited to working in [[direct_mode]].
