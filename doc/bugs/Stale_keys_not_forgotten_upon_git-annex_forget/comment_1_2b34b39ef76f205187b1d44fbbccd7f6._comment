`git annex forget` removes historcal data about where files were located in
the past, but it does not affect the current logs about the current
location (or lack of location) of files.

It would be possible to extend `git annex forget` to do that, which is one
approach to possibly solving [[fsck_reports_unsolvable_problem]].
