I am running centralized git-annex exclusively.

Similar to

    git annex get

I'd like to have a

    git annex put

which would put all files on the default remote(s).

My main reason for not wanting to use copy --to is that I need to specify the remote's name in this case which makes writing a wrapper unnecessarily hard. Also, this would allow

    mr push

to do the right thing all by itself.
