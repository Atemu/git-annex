Thanks for explaining the error message.

I did some investigation but I am not really understanding what is going on.

But step by step, lets take a file without any confusing characters in filename (e.g. '/'), so we use the file \".directory\".

1.) I run on the client:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
fabian@fabian-thinkpad /mnt/data-common/Audio $ ls -la .directory 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 fabian fabian 180 25. Apr 17:15 .directory -> .git/annex/objects/Ff/m9/SHA256E-s91--378daa8e2a232ae5a04d9f6c83003d8ccfe6c8b7547c1789a130ba94017283ed/SHA256E-s91--378daa8e2a232ae5a04d9f6c83003d8ccfe6c8b7547c1789a130ba94017283ed
fabian@fabian-thinkpad /mnt/data-common/Audio $ basename $(git cat-file -p \"HEAD:.directory\")
SHA256E-s91--378daa8e2a232ae5a04d9f6c83003d8ccfe6c8b7547c1789a130ba94017283ed
\"\"\"]]

2.) I run on the server:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
fabian@eifel:/mnt/raid/Audio$ ls -la .directory 
-rw----r-x 1 fabian fabian 91 Dez 13 17:35 .directory
fabian@eifel:/mnt/raid/Audio$ basename $(git cat-file -p \"HEAD:.directory\")
SHA256E-s91--378daa8e2a232ae5a04d9f6c83003d8ccfe6c8b7547c1789a130ba94017283ed
fabian@eifel:/mnt/raid/Audio$ git-annex fsck .directory 
fsck .directory (checksum...) ok
\"\"\"]]

So obviously the file is present on the server (it is using direct mode).

3.) On the client again:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
fabian@fabian-thinkpad /mnt/data-common/Audio $ git-annex get .directory 
get .directory (from eifel.fritz.box__mnt_raid_Audio...) 
  requested key is not present

get .directory (not available) 
  No other repository is known to contain the file.
failed
git-annex: get: 1 failed
\"\"\"]]

Also running \"git annex sync\" on both sides does not help.

This is the configuration:

Client:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
fabian@fabian-thinkpad /mnt/data-common/Audio $ cat .git/config 
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true

	uuid = a1f816fe-3fce-4887-a85c-b7b9e501a5d7
	version = 3
[remote \"eifel.fritz.box__mnt_raid_Audio\"]
	url = ssh://fabian@git-annex-eifel.fritz.box-fabian_mntraidAudio/mnt/raid/Audio/
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/eifel.fritz.box__mnt_raid_Audio/*
	annex-uuid = efe13d8c-2b02-455f-9874-b7043caa332f
	annex-cost = 175.0
\"\"\"]]

Server:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
