So, the test suite contains many tests that would blow up if it was breaking
this way.

It seems to me you must have something in your git configuration or other
local environment, or in the repo's git-annex config, that is causing this, 
since it doesn't happen to anyone else. Or perhaps something else like a
version of git that is somehow problimatic.

If annex.addunlocked is configured, `git-annex add` will add the file to
the annex in unlocked mode. This must be happening, because a) the command
does not say "non-large file; adding content to git repository" which it
would if annex.largefiles was configured to make that happen and b)
git-annex lock/unlock only operate on annexed files.

The thing I don't understand, and cannot reproduce, is that
.git/annex/objects should contain an object after `git-annex add`, and you
show it does not. It seems to me that `git annex whereis` should probably
be either complaining that it's lost the content, or tell about some other
repository that the content has somehow moved to. Or if not, at least `git
annex fsck` should have something to say about this situation.
