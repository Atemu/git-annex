This is caused by this bug in esquelito: 
https://github.com/bitemyapp/esqueleto/issues/80

The best way to avoid this kind of transient breakage in the haskell
dependencies of git-annex is to build it using stack, instead of cabal.
stack pins packages to a consistent working set.

I don't really see this as something that warrants a change to git-annex.
Using bleeding edge versions of all build dependencies will break, that's
why the build docs recommend not using cabal if you don't want to be involved
in fixing that kind  of breakage.
