Digging into your error message a bit more, it looks like this is not a http proxy (or if it is, it's letting some connections through). 

git-annex is testing the box.com WebDAV server, by performing 3 actions:

1. Creating the requested subdirectory on it, in your case \"git-annex\". 
2. Creating an empty file to that directory, named \"git-annex-test\"
3. Deleting the file.

Step 2 is failing. Which sort of suggests step 1 succeeded, but who knows..

So, if you go look at your files on box.com, do you have a git-annex directory?

Does git-annex/git-annex-test exist?

Does it also fail if you use a different directory, like https://www.box.com/dav/git-annex2 ?
