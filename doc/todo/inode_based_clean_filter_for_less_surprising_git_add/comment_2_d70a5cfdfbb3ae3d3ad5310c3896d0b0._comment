\"there is not an index to make queries for inodes be fast\" -- you'd only need to query for inodes in case of a rename, and only if the rename didn't use `git mv`.  So if adding a db index is non-trivial (requires v8?), maybe it's ok if this case is slow?  Also, the git index has the [inode](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/index-format.txt#L60) info and other `stat(2)` info preserved by a rename, and you'd only need to check index entries where the working copy file has disappeared; or maybe a [wmemchr()](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bindings-0.1/docs/src/Bindings-StandardC.html#line-722) through the index would be fast enough?
