The problem is that you have the repository in two groups.

The way that `standard` works is that the repository has to be in
exactly one group and then it will use the preferred content for that
group. It does not know what to do when there are two groups being
combined.

Solution for you is to run: 

	git annex wanted . anything

Since backup repositories have a copy of every file, matching anything is
what you want it to do. Since it's also in the archive group, other archive
repositories will treat it as an archive too, so once a file reaches your
combo backup and archive repository, it will be removed from other
archives.

Of course, you could also OR the preferred content expression for backup
with the preferred content expression for archive, but that would have the
same result since "anything OR archive" matches anything.

But we can't just OR the two preferred content expressions for two groups
in general. Consider the client and archive preferred content expressions:

	(include=* and ((exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*) or (not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)))) or approxlackingcopies=1

	(not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)) or approxlackingcopies=1

These are contradictory when a repository is in both the client and archive
groups; the client doesn't want anything that's in an archive, but if the
repository is both a client and an archive, it doesn't want any content
that it has!
