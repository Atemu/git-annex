Yes, I had a look at the cipher, and I cannot tell much about it. It is ... random :) And yes, I tried the removal of the '\n' characters like in pubkey encryption scheme, with no success so far.

I'll post my test script, which is a basic variation of the one given in [Decrypting_files_in_special_remotes_without_git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/Decrypting_files_in_special_remotes_without_git-annex/) to make multiple calls to lookup_key().
