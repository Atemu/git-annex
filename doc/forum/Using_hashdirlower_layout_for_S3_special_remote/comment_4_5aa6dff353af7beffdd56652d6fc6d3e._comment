Thanks Joey for your answer. However, even if directories are indeed totally virtual in S3, file paths are split using \"/\" characters when using S3 web console, for example (it's the same for Wasabi, for example). It's quite convenient!

Moreover, some S3-compatible services do create directories using \"/\" delimiters.
