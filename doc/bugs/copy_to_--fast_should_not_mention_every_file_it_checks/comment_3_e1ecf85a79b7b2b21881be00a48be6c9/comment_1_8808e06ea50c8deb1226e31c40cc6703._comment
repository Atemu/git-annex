That's a bug. It happens to be fixed in git head and there will be an
updated release with the fix soon. 

I appreacite you trying to find a related bug to the problem you're having,
but this bug report is not actually related, and was in fact closed in
2014. Opening a new bug report is better than commenting in the wrong
place..
