When addurl --relaxed is used, it doesn't hit the url at all, so doesn't
know the size, so annex.largefiles couldn't be applied in that case.

So that's an inconsistency. Perhaps a minor one.

`git annex import` doesn't currently honor annex.largefiles either.

I am ambivilant about whether these commands should, but it probably makes
sense for them to behave the same.
