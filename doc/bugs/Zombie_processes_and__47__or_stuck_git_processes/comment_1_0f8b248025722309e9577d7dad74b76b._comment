This is apparently the same repository where [[all_this_went_on|bugs/Unnecessary_remote_transfers]].

I don't know if this is indicative of a problem. I see more zombies than I would normally expect, but I don't know if the number is growing, or shrinking, or staying the same. You should at least look at ps -f to see which of the multiple git-annex assistant daemons you have configured to run on this machine (not a usual configuration) is the parent of the zombies.
