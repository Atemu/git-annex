Deleting `.git/MERGE_HEAD` sort of fixed the problem:

        client$ git-annex sync
        commit  ok
        pull repo2 

        Already up to date!
        Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested

        error: duplicate parent be6278073504cfd19400c100b1871ba4324f55db ignored

Thanks!

I have no idea how the repo got in that state. Syncing started to fail some time early December and for a few months I've been only using `git-annex assistant` and `git-annex webapp`.
