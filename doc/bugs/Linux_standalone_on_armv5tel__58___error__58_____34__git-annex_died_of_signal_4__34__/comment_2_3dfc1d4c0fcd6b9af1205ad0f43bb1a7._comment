Apparently, the issue described above is due to a misconfiguration of `ghc`, as reported in this recent [Debian Bug Report (#928882)](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=928882) which was triggered by [another bug report (#915333)](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=915333) from users reporting `git-annex` not working in Debian on arm5te.

In essence, this misconfiguration causes **all** Debian packages compiled with ghc not to work on ARM architectures below arm6. I hope that the proposed patch will be accepted soon.
