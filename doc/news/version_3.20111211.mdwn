git-annex 3.20111211 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Fix bug in last version in getting contents from bare repositories.
   * Ensure that git-annex branch changes are merged into git-annex's index,
     which fixes a bug that could cause changes that were pushed to the
     git-annex branch to get reverted. As a side effect, it's now safe
     for users to check out and commit changes directly to the git-annex
     branch.
   * map: Fix a failure to detect a loop when both repositories are local
     and refer to each other with relative paths.
   * Prevent key names from containing newlines.
   * add: If interrupted, add can leave files converted to symlinks but not
     yet added to git. Running the add again will now clean up this situtation.
   * Fix caching of decrypted ciphers, which failed when drop had to check
     multiple different encrypted special remotes.
   * unannex: Can be run on files that have been added to the annex, but not
     yet committed.
   * sync: New command that synchronises the local repository and default
     remote, by running git commit, pull, and push for you.
   * Version monad-control dependency in cabal file."""]]
