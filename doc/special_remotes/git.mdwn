Normally a git repository is not treated as a special remote, but as a git
remote of the normal kind. Two exceptions to that are [[git-lfs]] and
[[gcrypt]] special remotes.

But it is possible to register a git repository as a special remote.
git-annex will use it remote the same as any normal git remote, but its
url will be recorded. One benefit of doing this is it allows [[git-annex init|git-annex-init]]
to autoenable the remote.

First you need a regular git remote with the url that you want to use for
the special remote.

	git remote add tmpremote ssh://...

Then, to set up the special remote:

	git annex initremote myremote type=git location=ssh://... autoenable=true

Now `git annex init` in each clone of the repository will autoenable myremote.

Note that the name of the git remote (`tmpremote` above) has to be
different than the name you later use for the special remote,
since [[git-annex initremote|git-annex-initremote]] will refuse to use the name of an existing
remote. To work around that, you could finish by removing `tmpremote` and 
enable the special remote:

	git remote remove tmpremote
	git annex enableremote myremote
