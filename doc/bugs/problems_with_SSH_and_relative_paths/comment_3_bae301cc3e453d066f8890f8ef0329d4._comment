@joey, thank you for the response.  I can confirm that I can run `ssh remote.example.com git-annex-shell` no problem from my local machine.  Can you offer any other suggestions for things I could try to test the remote?  Could it be some kind of version incompatibility?  Is there some missing configuration I need to do on the server side?  Right now it's just a bare git repo, nothing else.

As for the absolute/local thing, I still there is some kind of issue there given the `/~/path/to/git` in the ssh command line in the process tree.  That's obviously not a real directory, so it seems like something's wrong there.  But it may well be what I'm experiencing is a separate issue.

Any other help you could provide would be very much appreciated.
