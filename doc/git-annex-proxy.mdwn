# NAME

git-annex proxy - safely bypass direct mode guard

# SYNOPSIS

git annex proxy `-- git cmd [options]`

# DESCRIPTION

Only useful in a direct mode repository, this runs the specified git
command with a temporary work tree, and updates the working tree to
reflect any changes staged or committed by the git command.

For example, to revert the most recent change that was committed
to the repository:

	git annex proxy -- git revert HEAD
  
To check out a past version of the repository:

	git annex proxy -- git checkout HEAD^^
  
To rename a directory:

	git annex proxy -- git mv mydir newname

To commit the changes to a specific file, first use git annex add to
stage the changes in the index, and then proxy a commit:

	git annex add myfile
	git annex proxy -- git commit myfile -m foo
