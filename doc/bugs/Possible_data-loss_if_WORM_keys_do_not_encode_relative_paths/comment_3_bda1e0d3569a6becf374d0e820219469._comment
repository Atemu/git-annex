One scenario where the above guarantee would be violated is when one
moves a new file of identical size, basename, and mtime, into a path
where a key-colliding file has been kept before. Still, Iâ€™d consider
this a scenario one could reasonably control for (especially in the
archive usecase); plus, even without manual control such a
move-induced collision would be much more unlikely than a collision of
basenames only.
