Hi,

I first tried messing around with required content settings in a test repo in direct mode. This is what I did to initialize a test repo:

    git clone existing-repo
    git annex init
    git annex required . \"include=*.jpg\"

Then I run fsck:

    git annex fsck 

And I get this output:

    fsck viber/0.02.01.0e411306e0b3fc90.jpg (fixing link) ok
    fsck viber/0.02.01.20943bf9c18e42.jpg (fixing link) ok
    fsck viber/0.02.01.5126da68987493.jpg (fixing link) ok
    ...

I expected the fsck command to complain that the required jpg files are not present in the current repo and fail. However, that is not what I'm getting.

Is this the expected behavior for a direct-mode repository? If not, is there something I missed?
