Seems that I misdiagnosed this. The error message from the bad TLS library was about a had certificate, not \"user error\" (which, confusingly, does not mean what user error normally means!).

Also, I see you reported this at <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-annex/>, so you're using that build and not the \"git-annex-bin\" build at <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=63503>. The Arch Linux build that's done from source couldn't be affected by the Debian-spefific TLS bug anyway.

I am reopening this bug report. 

Now, FailedConnectionException could be any of several things, but I noticed that someone else (perhaps cooindidentially using Arch Linux) reported the same error message here: [[Proxy_support]]. I wonder if you perhaps also have a http proxy that could be causing trouble.
