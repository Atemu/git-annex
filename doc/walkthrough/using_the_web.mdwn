The web can be used as a [[special_remote|special_remotes]] too.

	# git annex addurl http://example.com/video.mpeg
	addurl example.com_video.mpeg (downloading http://example.com/video.mpeg)
	########################################################## 100.0%
	ok

Now the file is downloaded, and has been added to the annex like any other
file. So it can be renamed, copied to other repositories, and so on.

Note that git-annex assumes that, if the web site does not 404, the file is
still present on the web, and this counts as one [[copy|copies]] of the
file. So it will let you remove your last copy, trusting it can be
downloaded again:

	# git annex drop example.com_video.mpeg
	drop example.com_video.mpeg (checking http://example.com/video.mpeg) ok

If you don't [[trust]] the web to this degree, just let git-annex know:

	# git annex untrust web
	untrust web ok

With the result that it will hang onto files:

	# git annex drop example.com_video.mpeg
	drop example.com_video.mpeg (unsafe) 
	  Could only verify the existence of 0 out of 1 necessary copies
	  Also these untrusted repositories may contain the file:
	  	00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001  -- web
	  (Use --force to override this check, or adjust annex.numcopies.)
