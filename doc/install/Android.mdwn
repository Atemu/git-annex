git-annex can be used on Android, however you need to know your way around
the command line to install and use it. (Hope to get the webapp working
eventually.)

## Android app

First, ensure your Android device is configured to allow installation of
non-Market apps. Go to Setup -&gt; Security, and enable "Unknown Sources".

Download the [git-annex.apk](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/android/current/)
onto your Android device, and open it to install.

When you start the Git Annex app, it will dump you into terminal. From
here, you can run git-annex, as well as many standard git and unix commands
provided with the app. You can do everything in the [[walkthrough]] and
more.

## autobuilds

A daily build is also available.

* [download tarball](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/i386/git-annex-standalone-i386.tar.gz) ([build logs](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/android/))

## building it yourself

git-annex can be built for Android, with `make android`.
You need <https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android> installed first,
and also have to `cabal install` all necessary dependencies. This is not
yet an easy process. 

You also need to install git and all the utilities listed on [[fromscratch]].

You will need to have the Android SDK and NDK installed; see
`standalone/android/Makefile` to configure the paths to them. You'll also
need ant, and the JDK.

Then to build the full Android app bundle, use `make androidapp`
