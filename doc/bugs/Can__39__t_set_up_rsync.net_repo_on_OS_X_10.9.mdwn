### Please describe the problem.

I can't seem to add the rsync.net remote on an OS X 10.9 machine running git-annex assistant version 5.20140128-g0ac94c3. The process complains about a missing `/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass` in the logs, and after a few retries rsync.net locks me out. This program doesn't exist on my system.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Click "Add another repository"
2. Pick rsync.net
3. Enter the credentials I got in the email from rsync.net
4. Click "Use this rsync repository"

The resulting logs will state that `/usr/libexec/ssh-askpass` can't be found.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex assistant version 5.20140128-g0ac94c3 on OS X 10.9.1.

### Please provide any additional information below.

I think I have found a workaround in creating that program as a shell script which echoes my password to stdout, but can't test right now because rsync.net have wisely ratelimited my password login attempts. (-:

I'll update this page if I can confirm the workaround works.

(I fully intend to roll that password as soon as I'm in, so no worries about a stale password falling into evildoers' hands.)
