For external remotes can pass to the `TRANSFER` request, as the `FILE` parameter, a named pipe, and use `tee` to create a separate stream for checksumming.

An external remote could also do its own checksum checking and then set remote.<name>.annex-verify=false.
Could also make a “wrapper” external remote that delegates all requests to a given external remote but does checksum-checking in parallel with downloading (by creating a named pipe and passing that to the wrapped remote).
