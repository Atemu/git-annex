There was a bug that caused it not to write the chunkcount file.
I have fixed it, and put in a workaround so fsck, etc, will
see that the file is stored on the remote despite there being no
chunkcount file present.

I was initially puzzled by your output showing the chunkcount file being present.
However, the bug also caused it to write a chunkcount file when chunking was disabled (ie, the logic for when to write the file was inverted). 
So, I think that the ls you show is after you set up the remote without specifying chunk size, and copied a file to it.

Please test with the next autobuild of git-annex (should be one within an hour my my posting this comment) and verify it can now see the files you stored on the remote with chunking.
