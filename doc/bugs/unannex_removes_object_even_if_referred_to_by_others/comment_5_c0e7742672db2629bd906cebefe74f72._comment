Your transcript shows unannex without --fast having the problem, and uninit not having the problem. Which is just what I said. Although I had to spend 15 minutes reading and replicating your transcript to figure that out.

This has been previously reported and discussed at [[Large_unannex_operations_result_in_stale_symlinks_and_data_loss]]. There does not seem to be a single entirely satesfactory solution. unannex --fast seems to be what you're looking for.
