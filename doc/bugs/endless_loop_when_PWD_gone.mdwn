`git annex get` becomes very unhappy as soon as `$PWD` is gone.
The easiest way is to `git checkout git-annex` while you are getting in another tab.

This results in git-annex entering an endless loop:

    fatal: Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory
    fatal: Unable to read current working directory: No such file or directory
