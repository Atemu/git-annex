When annex.stalldetection is set, rsync and gcrypt
special remotes do not display any progress. Also, the stall detection
cannot detect stalls, because that needs progress information to do.

These remotes have  `displayProgress = False`, and seem to be the only
affected ones.

It seems like it would be a good idea to make these remotes capture the
output of the program they run, and convert it to a progress meter.

(Also, these don't have progress output with -J either..)
