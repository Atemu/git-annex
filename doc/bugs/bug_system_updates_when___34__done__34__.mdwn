### Please describe the problem.

In lieu of a better place to ask/report this.  Is it possible to have an email sent when bugs are moved into another category?  I get emails on comments but not much when the bugs are moved elsewhere - they just seem to disappear.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
