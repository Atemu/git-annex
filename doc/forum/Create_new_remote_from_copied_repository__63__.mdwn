Newbie question. I decided to use git-annex for backing up my raw photo archive to a remote server. I was a bit pressed for time when I did this and did not really have time to learn about git-annex enough to do this in the correct way. I ended up creating a local repository with all my photos and then I simply copied this (using the ordinary system copy command) to an external drive that is now connected to a raspberry pi at my parents house (in another city) which I connect to through ssh. So the local repository and the "remote" are identical with the same name, description and uuid and everything. Is it possible to convert the "remote" repository (clone) to a "proper" git-annex remote? Can I just change the name or reinitialize the remote or something like that? This would definitely save a lot of time and hazzle since all the data is already there. Or am I better off just biting the bullet and create a new remote from scratch and sync the content from my local repository (600 Gb) over the Internet?   
Thanks!
