git-annex needs to know the uuid of a remote in order to operate. So at startup, if there is a remote that does not have an annex.uuid set, nearly any git-annex command will try to connect the the remote and query it for its uuid.

To prevent this being done for a remote, `git config remote.bad.annex-ignore true`
