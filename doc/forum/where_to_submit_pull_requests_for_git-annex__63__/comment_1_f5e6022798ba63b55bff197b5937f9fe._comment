The thing to do is to go to <https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo> and 
make a post there. Include either the url to the git repo to pull from, or
paste in a git patch to apply.

I took a look at your html anchors patch. After applying it and running
"make mans", the man/git-annex.1 page had broken formatting around those
html anchors. It would need some additional change to Build/mdwn2man to
make it deal with them.
