Andrew Wringler has released
[git-annex-turtle](https://github.com/andrewringler/git-annex-turtle)
which provides Apple Finder integration for git-annex on macOS,
including custom badge icons, contextual menus and a Menubar icon.
This looks really nice!

I've completed the P2P protocol with git-annex-shell. It turned out just as
fast and good as I'd hoped. 
[[accellerate_ssh_remotes_with_git-annex-shell_mass_protocol]] has the
benchmark details. 

Even transferring of large files speeds up somewhat;
git-annex is actually faster than rsync at shoving bytes down a pipe.
(Though rsync still wins in lots of other benchmarks I'm sure.)

Surprisingly, in one benchmark, I found accessing a repository on localhost
via ssh is now slightly *faster* than accessing that same repository by
path. I think that this is because when git-annex is talking to
git-annex-ssh, the programs run on different CPU cores, so there's some
extra concurrency.

There are still some implementation todos, some of which will make it
faster yet, and others involving potential edge cases. This is a big change
and will need some time to be considered stable.
