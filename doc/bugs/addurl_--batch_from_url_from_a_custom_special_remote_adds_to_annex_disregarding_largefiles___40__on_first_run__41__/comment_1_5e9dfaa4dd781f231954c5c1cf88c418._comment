not sure if of help, but I think it happens for the first 'addurl --batch' process invocation, not just for the first url (in my examples above I didn't have persistent --batch'ed process), since in the results of my batched runs (single addurl --batch process) I have not just a single file but many added to annex instead of git. (previously used a sequence of add/find/addurl which now replaced with a batched addurl)
