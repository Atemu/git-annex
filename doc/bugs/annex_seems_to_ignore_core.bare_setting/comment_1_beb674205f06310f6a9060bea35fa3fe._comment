There was a bug in 5.20131118 through 5.20131127 that caused git-annex init, when run in a bare repository, to set core.bare=false. This would also happen
if you had a bare repository that had not been initted, and ran some otherwise innocuous command like git-annex status in it (since git-annex can auto-init).

The most recent version you say is broken, 5.20131130-gc25be33, is right at the commit where I fixed that bug. But before I taught git-annex to automatically fix up a repository that it had done this to. You can get that fix in the current daily builds, or you can just run `git config core.bare true` to fix the setting, and version 5.20131130-gc25be33 shouldn't screw it up again.
