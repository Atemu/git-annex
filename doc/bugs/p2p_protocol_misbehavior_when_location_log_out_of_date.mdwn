With a ssh remote using the p2p protocol, git-annex move of 2 files,
with the first file no longer present in the remote (having moved
elsewhere) and the second file still, fails like this:

	move file1 (from remote...)
	verification of content failed
	failed
	move file2 (from remote..)
	Lost connection (fd:15: hGetChar: illegal operation (handle is closed))
	transfer failed

The problem is on the first move, the protocol does not handle a file
that's not present well, so it's not clear why it failed. And since that
closes the connection, the next move fails when it should not need to.
