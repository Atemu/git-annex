I feel that Helmut has the right approach to this general type of thing.

I doubt that bitcoin ASICs feature a fast data transfer bus, because bitcoin is a pretty low-data-volume protocol. Additionally AIUI, bitcoin ASICs get their speed by hashing in parallel, which allows them to try many variations of a block at once. So they probably rely on most of the data remaining the same and only a small amount changing. So it's doubtful this would be a win.
