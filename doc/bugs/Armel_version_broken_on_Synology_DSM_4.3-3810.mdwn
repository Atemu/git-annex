### Please describe the problem.

The armel daily build linked from https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/Linux_standalone/ doesn't seem to work.

When runshell is run as root, it hangs with no output and trying to run git directly from the bin directory gives 

"/git: exec: line 2: : Permission denied:."

When run as an ordinary user, it gives 

"./runshell: line 40: can't create /root/.ssh/git-annex-shell: Permission denied
chmod: /root/.ssh/git-annex-shell: Permission denied"

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

- Login in to NAS as root via SSH
- Download latest daily build via curl
- Untar, chown -R root:root, and CD in to git-annex.linux
- ./runshell or 'cd bin; ./git"

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Synology DSM 4.3-3810 and latest nightly build of git-annex.
