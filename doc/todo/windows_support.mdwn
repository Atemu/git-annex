The git-annex Windows port is not ready for prime time. But it does exist
now! --[[Joey]] 

## status

* `git annex add` doesn't work
* test suite doesn't work
* Bad file locking, it's probably not safe to run more than one git-annex
  process at the same time on Windows.
* No support for the assistant or webapp.
