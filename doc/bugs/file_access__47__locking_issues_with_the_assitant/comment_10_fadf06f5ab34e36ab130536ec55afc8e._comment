First off, I really like git-annex :-)

Secondly, if I make the change as suggested, what are the consequences?  When you add files to the annex back-end it may still be open and being written to?  But then the next hash-function will reveal the differences of an incomplete upload and fix things....  But it may be too late as it's sent to other repositories...hmmmmm...I guess I want to know if I do this will my data be safe?  I suspect not.

Perhaps the race condition could be mitigated against (not solved) by simply introducing a slight delay?  If only 5 secs it will catch many of these cases.  And longer would prevent git committing files that I save, realize I've slightly got wrong, tweak and save again.
