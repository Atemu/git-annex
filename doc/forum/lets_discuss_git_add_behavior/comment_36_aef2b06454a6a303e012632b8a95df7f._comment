I think this was the kind of change that bites hardest the people who don't follow development. I have a repo that for 6 years has had exactly one file tracked with git-annex. I don't want to track anything else. Then today, a file was auto-added to git-annex (tiny js file, no idea why) and when I pulled on server my web page went down :) Anyway, point being, if you don't want many files tracked by git annex, you probably don't read much about git annex either, and won't notice such a change until it bites you.

I did

     $ git config annex.largefiles '(largerthan=9999999999kb)'
