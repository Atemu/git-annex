Thanks for the reply, Ilya.  Sorry, I think my mention of `.datalad/`
along with an example that used a top-level dotfile was unnecessarily
confusing.  It's not an issue of sending some files dotfiles to annex
and some to git.  It's just wanting to avoid setting `annex.dotfiles`
in `.git/config` (or `git-annex:config.log`) of the repos that DataLad
touches.
