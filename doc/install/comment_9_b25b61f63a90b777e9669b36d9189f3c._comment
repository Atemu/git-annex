and details like what are high level differences between v6 / v7 / v8?

such as, is v7 \"stable\" and v8 \"beta\" ? this info seems to be no where on this site. 

(git-annex/ assistant) has release notes, why do we have to go to (git-annex/news ?!?!!) for the same?

I've been looking for this info for awhile now, I really don't get this omission.
