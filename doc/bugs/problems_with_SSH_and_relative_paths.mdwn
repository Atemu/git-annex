### Please describe the problem.

git-annex appears to not support relative paths for ssh remotes, e.g.:

`remote.example.com:path/to/git`

as opposed to:

`remote.example.com:/absolute/path/to/git`


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I was following the steps to setup a [centralized git repo](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/centralized_git_repository_tutorial/on_your_own_server/).

I have setup an SSH remote (referred to below as `remote.example.com:path/to/git`) and pushed to it as described in the docs.  I then clone from this remote elsewhere:

```
0$ git clone remote.example.com:path/to/git remote
0$ cd remote
```

But `git-annex init` runs into the following problem:

```
0$ git annex init 'local'
init servo (scanning for unlocked files...)

  Unable to parse git config from origin

  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore

  This could be a problem with the git-annex installation on the remote. Please make sure that git-annex-shell is available in PATH when you ssh into the remote. Once you have fixed the git-annex installation, run: git annex enableremote origin
ok
(recording state in git...)
0$
```

(Note problem but no non-zero return code.)

However, if I clone the remote with an absolute path there is no issue:

```shell
0$ git clone remote.example.com:/absolute/path/to/git remote
0$ cd remote
0$ git annex init 'local'
init servo (scanning for unlocked files...)
ok
(recording state in git...)
0$
```

I suspected something was amiss when things were taking a long time, and looking at the process tree showed ssh commands that include the string `/~/path/to/git`

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
