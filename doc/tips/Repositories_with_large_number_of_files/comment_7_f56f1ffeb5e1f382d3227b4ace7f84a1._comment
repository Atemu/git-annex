I just ran into related git scaling issues while trying to make a repo in a folder with 6.5 million files. [Writeup](https://breckyunits.com/building-a-treebase-with-6-point-5-million-files.html). I did things the naive/wrong way on purpose, but now I'm curious if I could actually get this work fast, and your pointers are a good help. Thanks!
