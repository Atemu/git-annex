thanks for the quick feedback. it can certainly be the case that i have two installs of git-annex out there... i'll take a look when i'm back in the office.

it wasn't obvious to me that the error was from the client-side of things, how could I tell?

wouldn't it be better if GIT_SSH would be set to the full path of the binary?

thanks!
