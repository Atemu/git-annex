This uses ssh, so the repository address can be pasted into the webapp
as a ssh server, and it should work already.

It probably does make sense to add gitlab.com as a canned solution alongside
box.com and rsync.net in the webapp.

Since the remote will be a full git repository, it should prompt the user
if they want to enable gcrypt to encrypt all the content client-side.

If gitlab has a reasonable API for creating a new repository, the webapp
could optionally use that, instead of needing the user to create one
themselves.
