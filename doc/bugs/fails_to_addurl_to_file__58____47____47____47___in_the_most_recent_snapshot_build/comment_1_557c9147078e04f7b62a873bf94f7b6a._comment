The -11 exit status is pretty unusual. Being negative suggests that curl
died of a signal (and so the high bit was set to indicate that). 

I guess that signal would probably be a SIGSEGV.

Perhaps this is an intermittent memory problem and git-annex version is not
relevant. I also see no changes in how git-annex calls curl.
