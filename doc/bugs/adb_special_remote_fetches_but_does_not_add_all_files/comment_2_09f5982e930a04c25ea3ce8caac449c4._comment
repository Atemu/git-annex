I'm facing a same issue and it persists (tried to sync a couple of times) for one of my adb remotes (DCIM on SD card, i.e. /storage/[vol_id]/DCIM and wanted expression which excludes thumbs and .emptyshow file).

I get \"Failed to import some files from [remotename]. Re-run command to resume import.\" message and no files are imported. Same as for the reporter of the issue, I get that all the files are pulled ok.

I'm using the latest version of git annex (8.20200309-ga9d56a1ab).
