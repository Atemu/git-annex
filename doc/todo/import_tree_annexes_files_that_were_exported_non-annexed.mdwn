If a tree containing a non-annexed file (checked directly into git) is exported,
and then an import is done from the remote, the new tree will have that
file annexed, and so merging it converts to annexed (there is no merge
conflict). 

If the user is using annex.largefiles to configure or list
the non-annexed files, they'll be ok, but otherwise they'll be in for some
pain.
 
The importer could check for each file, if there's a corresponding file in
the branch it's generating the import for, if that file is annexed.
This corresponds to how git-annex add (and the smudge filter) handles these
files. But this might be slow when importing a large tree of files.
