To properly use amazon AWS S3 for CDN, we need to publish videos to S3. Ideally, we would like to do this via git-annex as the back-end of video.debian.net is being migrated to git-annex by me, atm.

Obviously, we will need clear text names and proper directory structure, not SHA512E file names. This would need to be supported by the S3 special remote.

I talked to TobiasTheViking in the past and he hinted at a reasonably clean way to do this, but that a clean solution would need support from git-annex. I will link him to this page and ask him to supply whatever info is needed.


Thanks,
Richard
