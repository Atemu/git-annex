There should be a backend where the file content is stored.. in a git
repository!

This way, you know your annexed content is safe & versioned, but you only
have to deal with the pain of git with large files in one place, and can
use all of git-annex's features everywhere else.

>>> Very much so. Generally speaking, having one or more versioned storage back-ends with current data in the local annexes sounds incredibly useful. Still being able to get at old data in via the back-end and/or making offline backups of the full history are excellent use cases. -- RichiH
