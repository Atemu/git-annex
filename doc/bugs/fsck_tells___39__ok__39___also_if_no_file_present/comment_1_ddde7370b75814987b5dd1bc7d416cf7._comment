fsck finds problems with the repository.

A file not being present in the local repository is not a problem, if the
file is known to be present in some other repository.

The ability to have some files not present in the local repository, but
retreivable by `git annex get` when you need them, is one of the main
features of git-annex, since it lets you manage quantities of data larger
than you have space for on your computer.

If you want to know what files are not present in your local repository,
there is a way to do that: `git annex find --not --in here`
