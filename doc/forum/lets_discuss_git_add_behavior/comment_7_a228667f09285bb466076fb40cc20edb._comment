Re: this thread, I also think preserving `git add` default behavior (adding to git) is better.  I'm not sure it should *always* add to git.  The whole point of v7 was, as I understand it, to make it possible to use normal git workflow (`git add`; `git commit`; [make changes]; `git add`; `git commit`) with large files without thinking about it.  Existing scripts that just call `git add` and are unaware of `git-annex-add` would still work.  So it makes sense to let `git add` add to annex *when explicitly configured*.  In my use case, I'd like to configure it so that any files it adds to the annex are added as locked by default.
