That tip was written by leni536, and I don't really understand what it's
talking about with a difference in sync behavior. I'm not sure it's
accurate or describes what happens clearly.

To me it seems really simple, no matter if you have a regular work tree, or
are using git-worktree or whatever: sync fetches, merges, and pushes. Merging
updates the current work tree, and AFAIK not whatever other work trees might
be using the same .git repository. In any case, sync should behave the same
as git pull as far as updating work trees goes.

Can you please show an example of whatever problem you may have with the
current behavior?
