I can confirm that these are not collisions: these identical files are the same photos with different names, shame on Dropbox syncing from my smartphone. I was actually hoping to dedupe through git-annex ;-)

Some more questions/suggestions/conversation-starters:

* I suppose I can dedup them with rdfind (i.e., hardlinking identical files), do you foresee any side effects?

* may I change the hash function of git-annex to something not depending on filenames? (I suppose so, I'll have a look at the docs)

* if I can change the hash function can I regenerate the whole annex without re-creating it? (again I'll have a look at docs)

Thanks
