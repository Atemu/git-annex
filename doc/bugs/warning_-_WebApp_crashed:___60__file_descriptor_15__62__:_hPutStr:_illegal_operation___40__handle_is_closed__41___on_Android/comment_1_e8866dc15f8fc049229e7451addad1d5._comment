This is an intriguing screenshot, since it shows the webapp reporting a crash of the webapp! I think what's going on is that the web server thread run by the webapp is still running, although the webapp's own thread has crashed.

The log should be in `/sdcard/DCIM/.git/annex/daemon.log`. I would be interested to see it.

Does the webapp continue to update and function despite saying it crashed?
