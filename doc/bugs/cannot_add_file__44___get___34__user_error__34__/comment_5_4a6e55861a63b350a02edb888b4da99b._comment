Well, one way to use runshell without annoyance is to put a git-annex wrapper in ~/bin
like this:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
~/Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell git-annex \"$@\"
</pre>

I think I will repurpose this bug report: The git-annex inside the dmg should
be such a wrapper, so that it can just be put into PATH and used. The actual binaries in the dmg should be hidden away in a subdirectory where users won't stumble over them.

However, cabal is a fine choice.
