Does it work if ssh allocates a pseudo-tty?

ssh -t myuser@mynas "git-annex-shell 'configlist' 'mygitannexfolder'"

There must be some fundamental difference in the environment between the
same command being run over ssh and at the console that is making it behave
differently one way than the other. It could be the pseudo-tty, or an
environment variable, or a different user account, or whatever. 

I think that the only way to get to the bottom of this problem is going to be 
finding out what the difference is. (Or perhaps stracing it to see what
it's doing when it uses so much memory.)
