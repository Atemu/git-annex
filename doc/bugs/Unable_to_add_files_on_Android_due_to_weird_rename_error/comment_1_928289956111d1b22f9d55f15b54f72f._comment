I suspect you probably have another file already in the repository with the same content as the file you're trying to add. That, or something like it is why you're the lucky one who got to discover this bug in the build of the Android app! ;) The exact reason doesn't matter much -- It seems that it's trying to run `cp --reflink=auto`, which works on the build system, but not using the minimal busybox cp shipped with the Android app.

I have put out a fix, and the Android daily build has been updated, so you can upgrade to that.
