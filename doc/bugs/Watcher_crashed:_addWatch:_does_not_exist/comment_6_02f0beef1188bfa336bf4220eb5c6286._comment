Isolated the bug to a problem with the upstream inotify library.
<https://github.com/kolmodin/hinotify/issues/5> I've sent in a patch to that library that fixes the problem.

Unfortunately, I cannot work around it in git-annex more than I already have. It'll no longer crash, but will skip over files or directories that contain characters not valid in the current locale.

I have applied my patch to the haskell-hinotify package in Debian unstable, and have deployed fixed versions to all my linux autobuilds, including Android. (An Android user had mentioned also seeing this bug.)
