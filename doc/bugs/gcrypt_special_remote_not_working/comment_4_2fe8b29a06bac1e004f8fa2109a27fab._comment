Hmm, one idea is that git-annex fsck --from remote, when the remote is
encrypted, could check if the non-encrypted key is present. If so, it
could warn loudly.

(I don't think it could delete it safely; the user would still have to do
that. Deleting it might violate numcopies and lead to data loss. It
could move it to the local repo, but that risks fsck filling up the local
repo, and also it's not guaranteed that the local repo is a place the user
expects to continue storing data; it could even be a throwaway repo they're
going to nuke after the fsck.)

This does make a slow fsck path even slower, which is a bit of a heavy
price to pay going forward. Although the belt-and-suspenders nature
of checking that git-annex has not forgotten to encrypt some data may be
worth it.
