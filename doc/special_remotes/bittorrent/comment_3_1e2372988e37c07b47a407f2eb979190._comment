The workaround I described above ceased to work when git-annex or aria2c got configured more strictly; attempting it now gives a \"download failed: Configuration does not allow accessing\" error message â€“ that is understandable in a way (redirects from web pages should really not make git-annex access local files), but leaves wzhd's problem open again.
