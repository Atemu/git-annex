   * Automatically and safely detect and recover from dangling
     .git/annex/index.lock files, which would prevent git from
     committing to the git-annex branch, eg after a crash.
   * watcher: Detect at startup time when there is a stale .git/lock,
     and remove it so it does not interfere with the automatic
     commits of changed files."""]]
