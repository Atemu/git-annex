That won't work, and here's why:

You're in master, and you git checkout -b tmp

Now you're in tmp, and you git-annex move foo --from origin

Now you git checkout master. You delete tmp and tmp/git-annex.

Except, foo has been moved from origin to the local repo. So now the local
repo doesn't know it contains foo, at least until git-annex fsck notices
it's there. Worse, no other repo knows where foo went, only that it was
deleted from origin.

Notice also that, even if you keep tmp around, tmp/git-annex must never get
pushed, unless tmp get merged back into master. So even without deleting
tmp, you get into this situation where other clones don't know where the
file went.

git-annex v0 behaved just like this, and it quickly became apparent that it
was not a good idea due to this kind of scenario.
