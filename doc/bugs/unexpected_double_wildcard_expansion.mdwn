From the forum, it seems that git-ls-files very unexpectedly expands
wildcards in filenames passed to it. (Not a documented or an expected
behavior.)

This causes problems when eg, the user does `git annex add *.jpeg` and that
matches no files, but there are some jpegs in subdirectories. git-ls-files
re-expands the wildcard and finds those.

Seems that the best fix is to make Git.LsFiles paper over this git
misfeature, by always escaping wildcards in paths passed
to git-ls-files. AFAIK, no callers of Git.LsFiles expect to provide it
wildcards, because I was completely surprised when I learned they were
expanded.. --[[Joey]]
