Lauri a scratch patch would be very helpful. Encoding stuff makes my head explode.

However, I am very worried by haskell's changes WRT unicode and filenames. Based on user input, git-annex users like to use it on diverse sets of files, with diverse and ill-defined encodings. Faffing about with converting between encodings seems likely to speactacularly fail.
