   * Use statvfs on OSX.
   * Symlink timestamp preservation code uses functions
     from unix-2.7.0 when available, which should be more portable.
   * enableremote: List uuids and descriptions of remotes that can be
     enabled, and accept either the uuid or the description in leu if the
     name.
   * Catch up with current git behavior when both repo and repo.git exist;
     it seems it now prefers repo in this case, although historically it may
     have preferred repo.git.
   * Fix failure to build with aws-0.13.0.
   * When built with aws-0.13.0, the S3 special remote can be used to create
     google nearline buckets, by setting storageclass=NEARLINE."""]]
