### Please describe the problem.

`cabal v2-install` produces many lines like this in the build log:

    /bin/sh: ./Build/mdwn2man: cannot execute - Permission denied

and the man pages don't get copied to `~/.cabal/store/...`.

My guess is that Cabal is losing the file mode during some tarring/untarring.

Here's a patch that fixes it. (It makes the `#/usr/bin/env perl` at the start of the file redundant; not sure if you want to delete it.)

```
diff --git a/Build/Mans.hs b/Build/Mans.hs
index 9fb29d4a3..672dcd71c 100644

(Related question: is the installation supposed to put the man pages anywhere other than `~/.cabal/store/ghc-XXX/git-annex-XXX`? I.e. is it up to the user to either add that directory to `MANPATH` or copy them somewhere from there?)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

OpenBSD current

Cabal 3.4.0.0

git-annex master (commit `4e5a27841`)
