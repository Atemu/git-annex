Are you guys running Gnome? Using gnome-keyring?

I found the following highly suspicious code inside gnome-keyring:

[[!format C \"\"\"
        if (!self->directory)
                self->directory = g_strdup (\"~/.ssh\");
        self->tracker = gkm_file_tracker_new (self->directory, \"*.pub\", NULL);
\"\"\"]]

This seems to load *all* keys, as described. Not keys in subdirectories of ~/.ssh/ either.
