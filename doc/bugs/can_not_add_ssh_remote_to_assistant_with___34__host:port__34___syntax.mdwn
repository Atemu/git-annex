What steps will reproduce the problem?

* Start the assistant
* try to add a remote server (ssh) which is not on port 22. E.g. using myhost:1234
* after a rather long time the connection fails


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

it would be nice if this syntax was supported, or if an (optional) port field was provided.
second best solution: inform the user that "myhost:1234" is not the expected format.
third best solution (already in place) fail with "some error message".




What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20121016 on Ubuntu 12.04 (in future maybe also on home nas with wheezy)


Please provide any additional information below.

Thanks for a nice program and all your work on debian!
this is not really a bug more of a wishlist feature.
