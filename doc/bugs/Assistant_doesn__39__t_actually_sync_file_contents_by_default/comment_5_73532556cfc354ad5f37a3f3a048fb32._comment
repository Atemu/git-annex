\"What I want to do is to tell the assistant \"sync the contents of every file into this repository as soon as you can from whatever remote you happen to be able to copy it from\". I couldn't find a setting that would do that though.\"

The reason you cannot find a setting that does this, is because that is the default behavior of the assistent, when correctly configured.

Since it syncs files for everyone else, I conclude there must be an error in your configuration. You need to descibe it in detail and/or enable debugging and paste a debug log.
