Yes, it was a git-annex pointer. `cat myLargeFile.CR2` gave something like `'/annex/objects/SHA256E-s3--98ea6e4f216f2fb4b69fff9b3a44842c38686ca685f3f55dc48c5d3fb1107be4.CR2'`

It would indeed be helpful if there was a warning or something similar. Though, it is an error one is probably only doing once in the course of using git-annex :-)

Once again, thank you very much and have a good time!
