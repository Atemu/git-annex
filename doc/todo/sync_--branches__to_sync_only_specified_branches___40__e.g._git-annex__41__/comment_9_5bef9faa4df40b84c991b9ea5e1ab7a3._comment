Indeed, I had missed the case of --no-content combined with --only-annex.
Now implemented.

It will be in the next release, which has slipped one day due to the above.

I've improved the documentation of synced/ branches on the git-annex-sync
man page, although users normally should not need to concern themselves
with them.

I see where the man page confused you about REMOTE/synced/BRANCH,
that was some particularly poor wording and is fixed.

The difficulty with documenting what git-annex sync does in extreme detail
is that there are quite a lot of little hacks like synced branches that
most users just don't need to know about, but help users in particular
situations (who also generally don't know about or even notice it either).

Just for example, sync sometimes pulls from the same remote twice. Why
a second pull? Well, it knows it has spent a long time at the --content
step, and so pulling again before it pushes makes it much less likely that
the push will fail due to some other change having been made on the remote
in the meantime. If a user were manually pulling and pushing, they would
most likely pull again if their push failed due to such a situation, so
there's not much point documenting what sync does (which could also change
if I find a better approach).

So I prefer to keep the description of sync as high level as possible.
