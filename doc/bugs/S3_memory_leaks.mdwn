S3 has two memory leaks.

One only occurs with encryption. It was was fixed for bup, but
not yet for S3, in 5985acdfad8a6791f0b2fc54a1e116cee9c12479.

The other occurs independant of encryption use. Copying a 100 mb
file to S3 causes an immediate sharp memory spike to 119 mb.
Copying the file back from S3 causes a slow memory increase toward 119 mb.
It's likely that this memory is used by the hS3 library, if it does not
construct the message to Amazon lazily. (And it may not be possible to
construct it lazily, if it includes checksum headers..)  I have
emailed the hS3 author about this.
