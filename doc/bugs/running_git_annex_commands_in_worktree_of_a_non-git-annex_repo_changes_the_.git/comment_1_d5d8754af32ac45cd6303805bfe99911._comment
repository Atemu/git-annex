Hmm, fixupUnusualRepos was earlier changed to check for .noannex
files, and avoid doing anything. Didn't think big enough I suppose.

I agree, git-annex should not be hacking on git repos that have not had
git-annex initialized in them yet. Luckily all the hacks are about making
.git files into symlinks so links to annexed files work, so it will be ok
for the .git file to remain unconverted until the end of git-annex init,
or even by a subsequent git-annex command.
