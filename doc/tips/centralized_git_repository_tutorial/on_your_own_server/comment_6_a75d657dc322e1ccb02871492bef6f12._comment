I must add that after the previous commands finished, content of the repository was not shown on the server (it was all in .git). I made

    git checkout synced/master

and files appeared. Unfortunately it seems all timestamps were new, which I didn't like, and it was already asked here (http://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/does_not_preserve_timestamps/).
