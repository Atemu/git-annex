Is this repository using an adjusted branch?

Does the problem commit have a commit message like "git-annex automatic
merge conflict fix"?

I'm asking, because other than those two things, `git annex sync` is 
really the same as `git merge`, in fact that's what it does.

(It's also a bit of a red flag to me that you're using a mix of git-annex
versions going back to 6 years old! So some bug fixed in those
6 years could be affecting you.)
