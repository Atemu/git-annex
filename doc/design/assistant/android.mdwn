### goals

1. Get git-annex working at the command line in Android,
   along with all the programs it needs, and the assistant. **done**
2. Get the webapp working. Needs Template Haskell, or a workaround.
3. A hopefully small Java app will be developed, which runs the
   webapp daemon, and a web browser to display it.

### Android specific features

The app should be aware of power status, and avoid expensive background
jobs when low on battery or run flat out when plugged in.

The app should be aware of network status, and avoid expensive data
transfers when not on wifi. This may need to be configurable.

### FAT

Due to use of the FAT filesystem, which doesn't do symlinks, [[desymlink]]
is probably needed for at least older Android devices that have SD cards.
Additionally, cripped filesystem mode is needed, to avoid hard links,
file modes, etc.

## TODO

* avoid all symlink creation in crippled filesystem + direct mode
