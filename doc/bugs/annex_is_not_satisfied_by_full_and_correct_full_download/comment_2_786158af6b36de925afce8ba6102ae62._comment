I was able to reproduce this with an apache web server. It seems apache
doesn't send back a Content-Range header when the requested range is empty,
though it does otherwise.

Both wget and curl seem to accept that as indicating that nothing more
needs to be downloaded.

	joey@darkstar:~>wget  -c http://localhost/~joey/foo -O foo
	--2018-11-12 15:57:48--  http://localhost/~joey/foo
	Resolving localhost (localhost)... ::1, 127.0.0.1
	Connecting to localhost (localhost)|::1|:80... connected.
	HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable
	
	    The file is already fully retrieved; nothing to do.

Although, it's worth noting that the http server does the same thing
if a range larger than the url's size is requested.. And in this case wget
will behave the same as the above but hasn't actually downloaded the
current content of the file. So this seems like an ugly corner of http
that the two situations cannot be distinguished.

I suppose I'll make git-annex behave the same as wget and curl do.
