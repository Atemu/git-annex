{- Resolves a conflicted merge. It's important that any conflicts be
 - resolved in a way that itself avoids later merge conflicts, since
 - multiple repositories may be doing this concurrently.
 -
 - Only merge conflicts where at least one side is an annexed file
 - is resolved.
 -
 - This uses the Keys pointed to by the files to construct new
 - filenames. So when both sides modified annexed file foo, 
 - it will be deleted, and replaced with files foo.variant-A and
 - foo.variant-B.
 -
 - On the other hand, when one side deleted foo, and the other modified it,
 - it will be deleted, and the modified version stored as file
 - foo.variant-A (or B).
 -
 - It's also possible that one side has foo as an annexed file, and
 - the other as a directory or non-annexed file. The annexed file
 - is renamed to resolve the merge, and the other object is preserved as-is.
 -
 - In indirect mode, the merge is resolved in the work tree and files
 - staged, to clean up from a conflicted merge that was run in the work
 - tree. The resolution is committed.
 -
 - In direct mode, the work tree is not touched here, and no commit is made;
 - files are staged to the index, and written to the gitAnnexMergeDir, and
 - later mergeDirectCleanup handles updating the work tree.
