I guess you moved the files using something other than `git mv`. So the
files in `_archive` are not being tracked by git, the same as if you'd
added new files to the repo.

If so, need to `git annex add _archive`  
(or `git add _archive` since you're using v7.)

The lack of output from git-annex indicates it's not found any files to
work on.
