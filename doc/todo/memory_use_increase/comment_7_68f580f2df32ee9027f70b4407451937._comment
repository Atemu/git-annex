The seekHelper version in comment 3 significantly changes the 
shape of the profile. PINNED is still there, but only a couple mb,
and it's a constant amount of memory, not an upward slope.

So I think that identifies the main culprit for the mysterious PINNED.
runSegmentPaths is supposed to stream, but it seems it somehow is hanging
on to values longer than it should.

Although the max memory use of that version is still around 90 mb
according to `time`. The profile is flat at 3500 kb.
