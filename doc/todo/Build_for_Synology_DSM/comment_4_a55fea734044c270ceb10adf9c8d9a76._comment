I've actually tried several ones: 4.20130521 on sid, 3.20120629~bpo60+2 on squeeze-backports, 3.20120629 on wheezy and jessie, plus a package for Ubuntu 11.02. All of them try to load GLIBC 2.6/2.7 while my system has 2.5 only... I'll try a different approach: install Debian in a chroot on the NAS and extract all the required files, including all libraries.
