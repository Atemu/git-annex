Yeah, this is indeed a bug. It sets up a locked down ssh key to use for the first repository, and then the second repository sees there is a key for that server already, and does not try to set up a new one.

This is configured in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the server. You will see a key in there with a `GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_DIRECTORY` environment variable specified, which is what prevents it from using other directories. The simplest fix in your situation is to 
remove that variable, and then that key can be used to access any repository on the server.

What I need to do is include the path to the repository in the ssh key name, for new repositories created by the webapp.
