git-annex 0.20 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Preserve specified file ordering when instructed to act on multiple
     files or directories. For example, "git annex get a b" will now always
     get "a" before "b". Previously it could operate in either order.
   * unannex: Commit staged changes at end, to avoid some confusing behavior
     with the pre-commit hook, which would see some types of commits after
     an unannex as checking in of an unlocked file.
   * map: New subcommand that uses graphviz to display a nice map of
     the git repository network.
   * Deal with the mtl/monads-fd conflict.
   * configure: Check for sha1sum."""]]
