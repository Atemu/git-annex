FWIW well -- git-annex does at least a bit to maintain mtime.  E.g. when I 'annex add' a file, the symlink's mtime becomes the one of the original file.  Unfortunately it is not the case though whenever I acquire the load for that key, which possibly gets correct mtime again, but then symlink doesn't get mtime adjusted to match to the one of the key.
