Seems like you probably have files in git with nearly as long filenames as the key files. Course, you can rename those yourself.

This couldn't be changed directly in WORM without some ugly transition, but it would be possible to implement it as a WORM100 or so. OTOH, if you're going to git annex migrate, you might as well use SHA1.
