@cscsordas, please don't post problems on random pages of this website,
there is a bug tracker that you can use.

I do not think that git-annex needs to depend on xdg-open, any more than
it needs to depend on a web browser. Current behavior seems ok to me,
the user can open the url that it displays themselves, or can work out
how to install xdg-open.
