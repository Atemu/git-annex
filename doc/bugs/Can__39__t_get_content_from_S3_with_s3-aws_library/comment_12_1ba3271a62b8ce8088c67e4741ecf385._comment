I was able to fully reproduce this bug! I installed the old version of
git-annex that used the S3 library, and made a remote:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/rrold>git annex initremote S3 type=S3 encryption=none datacenter=ap-southeast-1
	initremote S3 (checking bucket...) (creating bucket in ap-southeast-1...) ok
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/rrold>git annex move me --to S3
	move me (checking S3...) (to S3...) 
	ok                      

Retrieval then failed using current git-annex.

Also, a remote made with the old git-annex with datacenter=ap-southeast-2
fails with the new git-annex.

Hypothesis: Either the new or the old S3 library must be confusing between
ap-southeast-1/2. My guess is the old library was just creating and using
buckets in the wrong place, at least when told to use ap-southeast-*.

---

I cannot reproduce anything about "the upload failed, but git annex thought it succeeded",
nor do I see any indications in comments 11 or 12 that git-annex's location
log is failing in any way. The sequence of commands in comment 11 ends with the
get failing, as it should, since the remote has been switched to a different
datacenter. I don't understand what you're seeing in comment #12 at all; 
it seems to just show it getting a file successfully.
