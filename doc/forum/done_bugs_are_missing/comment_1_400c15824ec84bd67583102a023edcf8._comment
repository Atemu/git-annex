Ooops. Hit post, before I finished.

â€¦but I couldn't find the bug report. I was pleasantly surprised when I did discover you had fixed this, so quickly! But the fix was only mentioned in the release notes. I think it is great to see the entire list of bugs you have fixed on the website, it shows how much effort you put into this project and how actively maintained it is.
