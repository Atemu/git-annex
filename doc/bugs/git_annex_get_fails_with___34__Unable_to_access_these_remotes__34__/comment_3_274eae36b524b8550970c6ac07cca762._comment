Hi Joey,

Thank you so much for taking a look. Another weird thing I discovered was that only a certain set of files (which were all annexed at around the same time) were affected. 

I ended up using cp manually to put then on external and used fsck --fast to fix location logs. 

I'm not sure how those files ended up in a weird state, but I don't want to waste your time on this. I'll create a new annex if the problem shows up again.
