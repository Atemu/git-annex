I doubt this has anything to do with v7, it made no changes in this area.
I've verified that git-annex's bup support is still working.

git-annex embeds a uuid into a bup repository, so the annex-uuid listed in
the git-annex repo's .git/config is only a cache of the last seen uuid. So
it seems that, when git-annex tries to read the uuid from your bup
repository, it's not finding anything.

In your bup repository's git config file, there should be an annex.uuid
setting. It seems that you've somehow lost that. There's no way git-annex
would remove it. You can of course run 
"git config annex.uuid 3af6c3c4-973a-481e-82d0-bfc15bff6f30" in the bup
repository to add it back, if you're sure that the bup repository is the
same one git-annex was using before.
