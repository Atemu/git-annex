Thanks for the reply!

- `git status` after running `git annex add` simply reports that there is a new file:

```
$ git annex add
add test.CR2 ok
(recording state in git...)

$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage)
	new file:   test.CR2
```

- The file system is just plain ext4.

- The behaviour of the standalone build does not differ.
