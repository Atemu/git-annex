Up at the top of this page there's an example to change the group
of the local repository and to make it use the standard preferred content settings for the
group:

    git annex wanted . standard
    git annex group . manual

The same commands can be used to configure a remote. Just put the name of the remote
instead of the "." that is used the refer to the current directory's repository.

    git annex wanted myremote standard
    git annex group myremote transfer
