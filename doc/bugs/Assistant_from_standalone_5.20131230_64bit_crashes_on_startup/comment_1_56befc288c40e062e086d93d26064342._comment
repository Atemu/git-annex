You seem to show `git-annex version` being run without crashing, so it does not seem to crash on startup generally.

Also, this build of git-annex is not linked to libgcc at all.

Also, git-annex seems to start your web browser.

So, it seems more likely that your web browser is crashing than that git-annex is crashing. The web browser crash may be taking out git-annex in some way.
