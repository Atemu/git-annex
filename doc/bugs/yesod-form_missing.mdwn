What steps will reproduce the problem?

build using cabal from a git checkout

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

successful build; error message is:

Assistant/WebApp/Form.hs:15:8:
    Could not find module `Yesod.Form.Fields'
    It is a member of the hidden package `yesod-form-1.2.0'.
    Perhaps you need to add `yesod-form' to the build-depends in your .cabal file.


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git checkout commit 90b62db1defdd223294935ec0bbaac883cd20c04 on OS X Lion

Please provide any additional information below.

adding yesod-form to the build depends in git-annex.cabal does indeed fix the problem!
