What is the best way to balance files among your remotes? 

use case:
I have git annex remotes on N external drives, I would like to git annex move --auto --from=$most_used_repo --to= $least_used_repo

expected result: 
the free space on all my remotes should be more or less equal.

is there a way to do this currently?
