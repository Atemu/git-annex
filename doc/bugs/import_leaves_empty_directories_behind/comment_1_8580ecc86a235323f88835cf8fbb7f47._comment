I tend to see this as a feature, since I import from camera SD cards
which have their own directory structure and don't know how the camera
would react to the directories being deleted.

Similarly, if I'm running some long-running process in a directory that's
dropping off files there, I don't want an import to delete the directory
out from under the process.
