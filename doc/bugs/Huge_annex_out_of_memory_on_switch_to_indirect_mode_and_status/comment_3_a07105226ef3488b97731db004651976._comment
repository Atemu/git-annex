It turns out that if you are using direct mode and you manually `git commit some-file` that is really big, that file is checked directly into git. Which is why direct mode's docs say not to do that.

Once you've got an enormous file in git, either on purpose on by mistake, it turns out that git-annex tries to buffer the whole file content in some situations. I am in the process of fixing those memory leaks.
