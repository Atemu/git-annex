Yes, it will auto-init in a clone. But you can still manually init of
course.

I am reluctant to add this if the only use for it is going to be until v6
becomes the default; it would make more sense to spend the time on getting
v6 closer to that point.

Especially because "v6 is worth using instead of direct mode" is a pretty specific
opinion to hardcode into git-annex. I can imagine other opinions, like "v6
is worth using instead of direct mode but not in WSL because sqlite
sometimes crashes there" (closer to my own opinion). Seems to me that if there
were a setting at all, it would need to make git-annex default to v6 mode always.
