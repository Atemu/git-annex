###What steps will reproduce the problem?

Suppose you have two types of folders you want to sync on two machines, e.g. Images and Documents.

I already setup the Documents folders on both machines to sync using local pairing and they sync happily. Now I want to do the same and I execute the same steps again for the Images and I choose to not combine the Documents and Images repositories, but keep them separate.

###What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The git repositories between both machines should be synced and all files should be transfered sucessfully between them.

Instead the one machine shows a message "Failed to sync with host1_Images" and in the log it says

    [2013-04-15 15:57:22 CEST] PairListener: Syncing with host1_Images 
    git-annex-shell: Only allowed to access ~/Documents not ~/Images/
    fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
    Already up-to-date.

I do not know how to debug this further cause I do not understand where this access-permission is configured.

###What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Machine 1: Gentoo Linux with Git-annex 4.20130405 from haskell-overlay.
Machine 2: Ubuntu 12.04 with Git-Annex 4.20130405 installed using cabal.
