Ok, I will try that.

For your information, I have rebuild the aur package inside a VM using the latest master. All tests passed.

Now I get a new error message with WEBDAV saying:

```
git-annex: WebDAV failed to write file: \"Conflict\": user error
```

As a note the current aur build is rather cumbersome because it needs to rebuild a lot of packages using cabal. I believe this is due to a few missing dependencies in the Arch repos [haskell-core] and [haskell-web] such as uuid, SafeSemaphore or c2hs.
