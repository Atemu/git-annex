Apparently, if a http git remote is on a local network address,
uuid discovery fails. The error message does not mention that 
annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses has to be set, but setting it solves
the problem. 

There needs to be a better error message, or possibly don't apply
annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses to uuid discovery -- which does not
seem like it would involve the kind of security problem that config exists
to prevent. --[[Joey]]
