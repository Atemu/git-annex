   * merge: Use fast-forward merges when possible.
     Thanks Valentin Haenel for a test case showing how non-fast-forward
     merges could result in an ongoing pull/merge/push cycle.
   * Don't try to read config from repos with annex-ignore set.
   * Bugfix: In the past two releases, git-annex init has written the uuid.log
     in the wrong format, with the UUID and description flipped."""]]
