### Please describe the problem.
I ran git-annex unused on a few annexes and they dropped files that were still being used. The annexes were fully synced and git-annex list showed the files in the annex they were dropped from.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
I'm not sure. The files lost appear to be more recently added files, so this bug must be in more recent versions. I will edit and fill this out when I know more.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
7.20191230-gef6d1e327 on Pop! OS 20.04 (Ubuntu based)

### Please provide any additional information below.



### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
I've used git-annex to maintain large file sets for years now and there is no better tool I know of.
