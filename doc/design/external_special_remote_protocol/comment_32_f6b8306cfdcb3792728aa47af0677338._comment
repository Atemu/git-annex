Some questions about CHECKPRESENT Key: (1) if Key is a URL backend key, should this return true if CHECKURL on the URL would return CHECKURL-CONTENTS?
(2) Should the external special remote implementation call GETURLS on the key and return true if CHECKURL would return CHECKURL-CONTENTS for any of the URLs?
(3) Calling GETURLS on a URL key returns an empty list; shouldn't it return a one-element list containing the included URL (at least if a CHECKURL call on that URL 
would return CHECKURL-CONTENTS)?
