IIRC the haskell runtime stopped using `timer_create` after ghc 7 or
something like that. These days it uses poll.

That said, `timer_create` is part of POSIX and part of the linux API
and that is unlikely to change. There might be something in the libc/kernel
interface that has changed in newer kernels, if so it may be that the
i386ancient build is not going to work with new kernels.. But it's there to
support old kernels anyway.

As for the setlocale failure, while LC_ALL=C avoids it, that's not
something I want to set by default, because people do use git-annex with
unicode filenames and that can impact that, as well as of course preventing
display of any translated messages by anything git-annex runs (though
git-annex itself is not translated). It would be good to get to the bottom
of the setlocale failure.
