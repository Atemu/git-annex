If you use `git annex addurl`, the file will use the SHA256 backend.

If you use `git annex addurl --fast`, it will use the URL backend.

**Either way**, git-annex will know that you added the file from the web,
and `git-annex whereis` will tell you the file is in the web remote,
and tell you its url.

I don't think there's a bug here. I think you got confused by
seeing URL some of the time and SHA256 some of the time. 
If you disagree, please post a transcript demonstrating your problem.
