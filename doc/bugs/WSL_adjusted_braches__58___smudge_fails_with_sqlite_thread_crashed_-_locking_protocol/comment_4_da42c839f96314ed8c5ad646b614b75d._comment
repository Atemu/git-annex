I tried using Windows 10 build 19041 from 
<https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/>
That is new enough to support WSL2.

At first, this bug reproduced. Turns out that still has WSL1 by default.
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10> explains how
to enable WSL2.

Unfortunately, those instructions failed at the final hurdle, 
`wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2` said Virtual Machine Platform needed to be
enabled, or virtualization enabled in the BIOS. I had already done the
former in an earlier step, so I guess VirtualBox is not enabling it in the
BIOS. 

Probably it needs nested VT-x. VirtualBox has that option greyed out
for me. 
<https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5030> says this needs virtualbox
to use Hyper-V, which needs a fix that landed 2 weeks ago, not yet in a
released version. Or use another emulator, or maybe try it on real
hardware?
