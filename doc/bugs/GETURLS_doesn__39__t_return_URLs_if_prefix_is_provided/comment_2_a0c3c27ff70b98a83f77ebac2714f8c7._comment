could you try on your end with as obscure URL as mine? i.e.
'dl+archive:SHA256E-s153--f378a42b6ff4d90091a7dfa37ebe1fe2fc5926eafd12cde1f2ba5fd1bcbf5e1e.tar.gz/d/test.dat'
may be something to do with the / in the url name?
as posted on IRC, here are  two runs protocols with all the details, where I don't spot any related difference in runs
