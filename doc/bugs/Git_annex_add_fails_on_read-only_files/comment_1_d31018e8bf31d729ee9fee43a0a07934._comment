I cannot reproduce this problem on Linux, with version 4.20131106. I tried in both direct and indirect mode, on Linux. 

I was, however, able to exactly reproduce the error message if I made the *directory* be not writable, and used indirect mode. This is because git-annex has to move the file the .git/annex/objects, and put a symlink in place, and so has to be allowed to write to the directory. Interestingly, direct mode does not have this limiation, although I doubt git-annex would ever be very useful when run in a directory you lack write permission to.
