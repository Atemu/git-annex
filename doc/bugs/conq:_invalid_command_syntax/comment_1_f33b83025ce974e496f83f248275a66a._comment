AFAICs, you probably just have a \"conq\" program that is running in the background and emitted this error.

The error message is not part of git-annex; it does not run any \"conq\" thing itself. Although you could try passing the --debug parameter to check the commands it does run to see if one of them somehow causes this conq thing.
