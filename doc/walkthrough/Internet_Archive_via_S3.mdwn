[The Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org/) allows members to upload
collections using an Amazon S3 
[compatible API](http://www.archive.org/help/abouts3.txt), and this can
be used with git-annex's [[special_remotes/S3]] support. 

So, if you're an archivist, you can locally archive things with git-annex,
and define remotes that correspond to "items" at the Internet Archive,
and use git-annex to upload your files to there.
Of course, your use of the Internet Archive must comply with their
[terms of service](http://www.archive.org/about/terms.php).

## step 0

Sign up for an account, and get your access keys here:
<http://www.archive.org/account/s3.php>
	
	# export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=blahblah
	# export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxx

Now go to <http://www.archive.org/create/> and create the item.
This allows you to fill in metadata which git-annex cannot provide to the
Internet Archive. (It also works around a bug with bucket creation.)

(Note that there seems to be a bug in either hS3 or the archive that
breaks authentication when the item name contains spaces or upper-case
letters.. use all lowercase and no spaces.)

Specify `host=s3.us.archive.org` when doing initremote to set up
a remote at the Archive. It does not make sense to use encryption.
For the bucket name, specify the item name created in step 1.

	# git annex initremote panama type=S3 encryption=none host=s3.us.archive.org bucket=panama-canal-lock-blueprints
	initremote archive-panama (checking bucket) (creating bucket in US) ok
	# git annex describe archive-panama "Internet Archive item for my grandfather's Panama Canal lock design blueprints"
	describe archive-panama ok

Then you can annex files and copy them to the remote as usual:

	# git annex add photo1.jpeg
	add photo1.jpeg ok
	# git annex copy photo1.jpeg --to archive-panama
	copy (checking archive-panama...) (to archive-panama...) ok

Note that it probably makes the most sense to use the WORM backend
for files, since that exposes the original filename in the key stored
in the Archive, which allows its special processing for sound files,
movies, etc to be done. Also, the Internet Archive has restrictions
on what is allowed in a filename; particularly no spaces are allowed.
