Changed to fd 14 and not 15, so my change to use the dupped stdout did take effect.

Interesting. Either dup() is just failing (silently!), or the `am` command is somehow closing the assistant's fds (not sure if that's possible).

In either case, it's only happening on your device, not on mine.

I suppose this will just need to wait until I sort out better the opening of the webapp on android. The \"crash\" does not seem like it will affect the actual functioning of the webapp.
