You used the WORM backend which is not the default backend, and which does
not preserve the extension inside the symlink target in all cases.

You'll need to re-upload the data to the remotes since you've added it back
under a different key. It would also be possible to use `git annex
reinject` on the remote, pointing it at the old content's filename.
