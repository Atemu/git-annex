The survey is now live,
<http://git-annex-survey.branchable.com/polls/2018/>

I had said I was going to clear votes to the draft survey, but for
technical reasons I decided not to. So if you already voted you don't need
to vote again, but if you made any joke votes please go change your vote.
(I removed the proposed port of git-annex to the TOPS-20.)
