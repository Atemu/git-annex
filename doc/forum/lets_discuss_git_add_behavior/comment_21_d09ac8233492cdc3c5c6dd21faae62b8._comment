Ilya, by the time the pre-commit hook runs, `git add` would have already
written the large file into the object file, so stuff like `git gc` would
pay the price of it even if it were kept out of a commit.

In other words, that has the same problems that v5 unlocked files had when
git add or git commit was run on them. I've seen plenty of users bitten by
that with v5. Fixing that problem was a (minor) motivation for v7.
