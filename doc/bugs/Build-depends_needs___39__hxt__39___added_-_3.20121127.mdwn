What steps will reproduce the problem?

Install git-annex via cabal - either from Hackage or as a manual install.  (i.e. <http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/cabal/>)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expect a clean install.

However, get the following error:

    Assistant/Install.hs:24:8:
        Could not find module `Data.AssocList'
        It is a member of the hidden package `hxt-9.3.1.1'.
        Perhaps you need to add `hxt' to the build-depends in your .cabal file.
        Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex: 3.20121127
OS: Mac OSX 10.6.8

Please provide any additional information below.

The fix seems to be as simple as adding 'htx' to the 'git-annex.cabal' file:

    Executable git-annex
      Main-Is: git-annex.hs
      Build-Depends: MissingH, hslogger, directory, filepath,
       unix, containers, utf8-string, network (>= 2.0), mtl (>= 2.1.1),
       bytestring, old-locale, time,
       -- Added htx here
       hxt,
       pcre-light, extensible-exceptions, dataenc, SHA, process, json, HTTP,

> I removed the need for hxt, which was accidental. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
