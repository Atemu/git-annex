# What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Use assistant to setup a local repository (client group) and a remote repository (via ssh, backup group).

2. Add some big files and wait for them to be syncronized.

3. Manually switch to indirect mode (to make 'drop' work)

4. Drop the file's content from the local repository.

5. Rename the file using any file manager or mv on the command line.


# What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

* Expected outcome was the file being renamed and that name change being propagated to the remote repository without re-transferring the whole file. I didn't drop it for nothing!

* Instead, the file was renamed and the file's content was retrieved from the remote repository.


# What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
