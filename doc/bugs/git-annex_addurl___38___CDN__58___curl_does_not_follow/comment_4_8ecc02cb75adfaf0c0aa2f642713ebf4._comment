allowed-url-schemes defaults to including https and http and ftp. This error
message could only happen if you had earlier set allowed-url-schemes to something
other than the default:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/xxx>git config annex.security.allowed-url-schemes "foo"
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/xxx>git annex addurl  https://cdn.media.ccc.de/congress/2018/h264-sd/35c3-9462-eng-deu-fra-What_The_Fax_sd.mp4

Whatever redirect might be involved in that url is not relevant because
this error message only occurs when the url you provided does not use an
allowed url scheme. If it had started to download and then redirected to
some other scheme, that would have resulted in a different error message.

So, this was a local misconfiguration not a bug.
