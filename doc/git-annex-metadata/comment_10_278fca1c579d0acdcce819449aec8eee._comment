From this man page, it's not totally clear how/where the metadata is stored. Is it inside the Git repo (i.e. as regular file), or inside the Annex, or somewhere else? Is this information synced when you do `git push` (as part of Git), or via `git annex sync`? 

How does it resolve any conflicts?

Is the metadata itself under version control? (If it is in Git itself, then clearly yes, but that's not clear to me.)
