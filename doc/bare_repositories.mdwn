Due to popular demand, git-annex can now be used with bare repositories.

**This is still an experimental feature!** 

Known to work ok, so far for local bare repositories only:

* `git annex move --to` and `--from`, when pointed at a bare repository.
* `git annex copy` ditto.
* `git annex drop` can check that a bare repository has a copy of data
  that is being dropped.
* `git annex get` can transfer data from a bare repository.

There are a few caveats to keep in mind:

* Using non-local bare repositories is not tested and probably broken.
* `git annex init` can be run in a bare repository, but it cannot
  store the name you gave the repository in .git-annex/uuid.log (because
  the bare repository has no such file to commit to).
* `git annex trust` cannot be used in a bare repository, and currently
  does something pointless. Same for `untrust` and `semitrust`.
* `git annex fromkey` does something pointless in a bare repository.
* `git annex fsck` cannot detect any problems in a bare repository.
* `git annex unused` will think everything stored in a bare repository
  is unused.
* `git annex setkey` is a plumbing-level command, and using it manually
  to add content to a bare repository is not recommended, since there
  will be no record accessible by other repositories that the content
  is stored there.
* `git-annex-shell inannex` fails in a bare repository
