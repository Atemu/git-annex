### Please describe the problem.
I get this same internal server error when doing the encrypted rsync repo option:

    user error (gpg ["--quiet","--trust-model","always","--gen-random","--armor","1","512"] exited 2)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. click Configuration > repositories
2. click Remote Server
3. On "Ready to add remote server" screen click Use an encrypted repo
