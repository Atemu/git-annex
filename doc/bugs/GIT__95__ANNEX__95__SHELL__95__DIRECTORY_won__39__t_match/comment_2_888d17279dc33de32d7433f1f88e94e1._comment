OK, sorry for making this weird bug report then. I was getting errors like

    rrsync: SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND='git-annex-shell' is not rsync

so I assumed that my rrsync setup was incorrect and maybe it had something to do with your [recent blog](https://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog/day_486__time_to_ditch_rsync/). Unfortunately I cannot reproduce it right now, so I guess I'll wait until it happens again.
