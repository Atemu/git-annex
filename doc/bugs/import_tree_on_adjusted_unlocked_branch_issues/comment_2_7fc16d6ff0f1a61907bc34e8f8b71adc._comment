Only workaround would be to `git checkout master` before running the
import, and then re-run `git annex adjust` to re-enter the adjusted branch.

But that may be problimatic depending on why you're using adjusted
branches, or just expensive.

git-annex merge is *supposed* to deal with this problem, it's supposed
to adjust the branch before merging it. git-annex sync does too. 
But the test suite is actually using git-annex merge, so it seems
the bug is in git-annex merge/sync.
