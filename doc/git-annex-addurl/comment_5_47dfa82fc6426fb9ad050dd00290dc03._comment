Is there already a way to specify flags to youtube-dl on a per-file basis.  I think it would be OK to do it during either during addurl (modifying the resulting reference that is stored in the annex somehow), or during git-annex get.  This is so that the preferred format can be specified.  Primarily this would enable to download audio-only formats for some files.  ) Apologies if I missed some documentation on how to achieve this)
