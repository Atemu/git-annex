Compared to other projects, git-annex meets most of your requirements (1-13; and 14 with a quirk). I myself have been looking for alternatives to git-annex (mainly for performance reasons), but there simply are none. <br>
To not version Files (14), you can delete/drop old versions by listing unused keys (using `git-annex-unused`), then force drop them and mark them as dead (using `git annex dead --key`).
