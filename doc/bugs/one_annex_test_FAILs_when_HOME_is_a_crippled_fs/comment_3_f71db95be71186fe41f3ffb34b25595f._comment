Testing 8.20200522+git156-gc8ff3e082-1~ndall+1 leads to a stall with HOME on crippled fs. Unfortunately I didn't store that log, restarted -- passed

Downloaded and installed .deb from the artifacts of https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/pull/15/checks?check_run_id=763826515, set crippled fs the same way as on github actions -- passed on the first try, and stalled on the next one:
