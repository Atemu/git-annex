git-annex 8.20210310 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * When non-annexed files in a tree are exported to a special remote,
    importing from the special remote keeps the files non-annexed,
    as long as their content has not changed, rather than converting
    them to annexed files.
    (Such a conversion will still happen when importing from a remote
    an old git-annex exported such a tree to before; export the tree
    with the new git-annex before importing to avoid that.)
  * Added support for git-remote-gcrypt's rsync URIs, which access a remote
    using rsync over ssh, and which git pushes to much more efficiently
    than ssh urls.
  * unregisterurl: New command.
  * registerurl: Allow it to be used in a bare repository.
  * Prevent combinations of options such as --all with --include.
  * Fixed handling of --mimetype or --mimeencoding combined with
    options like --all or --unused.
  * Fix handling of --branch combined with --unlocked or --locked.
  * Fix support for local gcrypt repositories with a space in their URI.
  * uninit: Fix a small bug that left a lock file in .git/annex
  * Windows: Correct the path to the html help file for 64 bit build.
  * OSX dmg: Updated bundled git to 2.30.2 which fixes CVE-2021-21300."""]]
