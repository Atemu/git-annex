\"This build process is done on a Debian system, and it needs to use dpkg to examine the host system\" -- would it be hard to make this work on CentOS?  (For building the standalone tarball as part of building the [conda-forge package](https://github.com/conda-forge/git-annex-feedstock/), where the build process uses [this docker image](https://github.com/conda-forge/docker-images/blob/master/linux-anvil-comp7/Dockerfile).)
