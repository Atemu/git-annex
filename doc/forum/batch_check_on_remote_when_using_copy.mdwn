When I copy my local repository with SHA* to a remote repo with SHA*, every single file is checked by itself which seems rather inefficient. When my remote is accessed via ssh, git-annex opens a new connections for every check. If you are not using a ssh key or key agent, this gets tedious...

For all locked files, either git's built-in mechanisms should be used or, if that's not possible, a few hundred checksums (assuming SHA* backend) should be transfered at once and then checked locally before deciding that to transfer.
