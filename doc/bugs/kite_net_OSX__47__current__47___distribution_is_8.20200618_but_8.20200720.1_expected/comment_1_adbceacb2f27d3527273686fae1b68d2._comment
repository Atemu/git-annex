This is a near duplicate of a bug you filed before. I'm dubious about the
value of these bug reports. As I said before:

The build version being a little behind is not uncommon when the
autobuilder has not been keeping up for whatever reason. I generally don't
block releases on autobuilds if it's the fault of the autobuilder and not
a bug in git-annex's build process or test suite, and just ship the latest
available build.

But maybe I'm missing something about how problimatic the build being
slightly behind until the next release is for you?

The autobuilder has since caught up again, so the daily
build is current.
