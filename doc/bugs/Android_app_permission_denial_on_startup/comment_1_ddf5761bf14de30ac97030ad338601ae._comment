> startActivity asks to run as user -2 but is calling from user 0; this requires android.permission.INTERACT_ACROSS_USERS_FULL

The webapp continues running despite this, so you can certainly work around this by copying and pasting the displayed url into the web browser.

Based on this post, I cannot simply modify the app to request this permission. I don't know why your Android is requiring this permission, which AFAICS is supposed to be used to switch which user is logged in, when I'm merely trying to open a web browser. You might try closing any web browser you have open and see if that avoids the problem.
