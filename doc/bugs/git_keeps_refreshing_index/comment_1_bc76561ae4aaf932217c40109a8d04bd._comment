When using v7 repositories, git will do this when there are unlocked files
that have had their content changed.

git only displays that message when it thinks its going to have to
do a lot of work (re-smudging a lot of files), so you'd mostly see this
happen in a larger repository that has had a lot of (unlocked) files change
in some way.
