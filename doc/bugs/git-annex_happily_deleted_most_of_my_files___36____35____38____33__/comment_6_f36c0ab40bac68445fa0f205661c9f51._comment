It's approximately 1000 times easier for someone who is experiencing a
problem to paste a tracript into this bug report than it is for me to guess
what someone might be doing and reproduce their bug (or problem, or mistake
or oops, or whatever) from basically no information.

This is why I ask for bugs to be filed with either transcripts, or the
steps that can be used to reproduce them.

I think you'll find that if you post enough information for a bug to be
reproduced, it'll get fixed quite fast.
