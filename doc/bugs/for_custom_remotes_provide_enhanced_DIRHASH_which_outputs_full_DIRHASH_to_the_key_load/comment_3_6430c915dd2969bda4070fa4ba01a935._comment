I've added a contentlocation command

I'd expect an external command to not be much slower than using the pipe
for this. It does not need to spin up any git commands etc to get the
content location. Also, you can pass it multiple keys to query at one time
if necessary.

I guess we'll see if this is too slow and can revisit it if so..
