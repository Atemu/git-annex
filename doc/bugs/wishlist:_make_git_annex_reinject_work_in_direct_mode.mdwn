### Please describe the problem.

`git annex reinject` refuses to work while in direct mode.

When in direct mode git annex reinject could simply perform `rm $symlink; mv $file_copy .; git annex add $file`. I prefer having git annex doing that so I am sure I am not messing up (mistakenly adding new files for instance) and everything is properly managed.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 4.20130516.1
