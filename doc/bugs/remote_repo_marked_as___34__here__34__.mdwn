### Please describe the problem.

``git annex info`` shows a local repo as "not here" (withou the ``[here]`` tag), and shows a remote repo with the ``[here]`` tag.

I had to manually edit `.git/config` to set my local repo's UUID to the correct one.

> Well, git-annex can only display information that you've told it. 
> In this case you seem to have done something wrong with UUIDs, and so it
> displayed [here] next to the UUID of the local repo, as it's supposed to.
> There's no bug here I think. [[done]] --[[Joey]]

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I just ``git annex dead`` an old repo, and ``git annex semitrust`` a new repo by the same name as the old repo.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, lots of luck (need more skill).

git-annex may need more error catches to prevent a wrong order of commands from corrupting a repo. But still, git annex works great.
