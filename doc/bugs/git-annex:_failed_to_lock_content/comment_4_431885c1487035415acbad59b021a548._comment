Thanks, that's consistent with my analysis.

The only thing I don't understand is how a file on a vfat filesystem can
have mode 444. When I make a vfat filesystem and mount it on linux,
chmod doesn't change the mode of files at all; they're hardcoded at 755.

Is your drive mounted with any interesting mount options? Paste the output
from `mount` for the drive.

Can you chmod the file to have some mode other than 444?
