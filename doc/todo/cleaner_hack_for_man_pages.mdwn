In recent history, we have realized that the small Perl script that
generates the man pages from Markdown is fairly limited.

Two approaches have been considered:

* go-md2man
* pandoc

Here is how pandoc does it:

    $ pandoc -f markdown -t man doc/git-annex-shell.mdwn | pastebinit
    http://paste.debian.net/424341/


Both initially fail at setting a proper `.TH` line on top, but
otherwise seem to work more or less correctly. --[[anarcat]]
