`git-annex init` runs git something like 30 times, so it's close to the worst
case for a single git-annex command, other than when smudge filters are run.

I tried inlining runshell into both git and git-annex scripts, thinking
that the overhead of starting the second shell script might be measurable.
It was not; I saw `git-annex init` taking 0.10-0.14s before and after.

I also tried trimming out some parts of the script that normally
don't run, like the android support, but that didn't speed it up.

With the consolidated lib dirs, I did see `git-annex init` drop to 0.07-0.10s.

Ok, I found a way to consolidate the directories that will not include
directories for optimised libs. Implemented that.
