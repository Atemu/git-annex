git-annex 3.20120230 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * "here" can be used to refer to the current repository,
     which can read better than the old "." (which still works too).
   * Directory special remotes now support chunking files written to them,
     avoiding writing files larger than a specified size.
   * Add progress bar display to the directory special remote.
   * Add configurable hooks that are run when git-annex starts and stops
     using a remote: remote.name.annex-start-command and
     remote.name.annex-stop-command
   * Fix a bug in symlink calculation code, that triggered in rare
     cases where an annexed file is in a subdirectory that nearly
     matched to the .git/annex/object/xx/yy subdirectories."""]]
