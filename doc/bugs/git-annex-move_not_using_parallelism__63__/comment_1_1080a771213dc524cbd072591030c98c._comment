Do you see git-annex displaying multiple concurrent actions at the same
time?

Is annex.pidlock set?

You mention threads, which makes me think you may be examining the
processes's OS threads. But haskell uses green threads. Perhaps I should
not try to guess what you are talking about with the mention of "threads",
but the bug report is very much not clear about what the problem looks
like or how to reproduce it, and I am grasping at straws.
