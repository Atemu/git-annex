Very similar setup. Initially set up on a Mac, then tried to set up the first local pairing with a Linux system. Basically seeing exactly the same thing.

# Versions and Stuff:

## Mac:

* OS X 10.8.4
* git-annex 4.20130909-ga29f960 (downloaded about half an hour ago!)
* BTW I have git installed from Homebrew, version 1.8.3.4 in my shell's $PATH, but obviously /usr/bin/git from the system is intact.
* Hostname: celestia.local
* Username: rachel

## Linux:
* Ubuntu 13.04
* git-annex 3.20121112ubuntu4 (from Ubuntu's own repos)
* I note that's later than the version you said this bug was fixed in, hence the report. :-)
* Hostname: twilight.local (mDNS domain not appended even by hostname -f but avahi is working)
* Username: rachel

IPv6 is active, but I note a comment somewhere that that's probably not relevant for git-annex.

Machines are very local to each other, in the same room, connected via a gigabit switch. They can definitely see each other. :-)
