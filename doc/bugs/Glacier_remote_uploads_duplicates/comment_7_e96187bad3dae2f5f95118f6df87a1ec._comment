Ok, I've merged the glacier branch into master. I would still be happy to see some testing of this before my next release (in a week).

I guess I'll close this bug report. There are certainly still problems that can happen if there are multiple repositories all writing to glacier independently. Seems to me that one good way to deal with this is to set up a single remote that is configured to be a gateway to glacier.
