### Please describe the problem.

I have a very simple use case for Git Annex on Android : I want my photos to be transferred to my home server automatically, in a special "incoming photos" folder, where they eventually get classified into other folders or deleted. git-annex in installed on this server.

However, adding a Remote server (ssh) repository on a Photos repository on Android results in a totally confusing situation where the files on the Android device are removed and transferred to a bare repository on the server. Getting out of this sticky situation requires some commandline-fu.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Install git-annex on Android
2. Open git-annex from the apps menu
3. Accept offer to create a Photos repository
4. Add a "Remote server" server repository
5. Wait a bit.
6. "Uh oh."

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Using git-annex Android and Debian.

### Please provide any additional information below.

I thought that adding a remote server repository would result in two non-bare repositories, such as what the Local pairing mode achieves. However Local pairing is not available on Android. I assumed the remote server would function in the same manner, except that I entered the SSH connection information manually.
