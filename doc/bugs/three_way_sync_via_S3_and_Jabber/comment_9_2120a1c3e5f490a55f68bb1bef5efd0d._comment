It seems I may have spoken to soon, currently zakaz (the work machine) is out of sync with the other two again.

daemon.log has a bunch of these:
<pre>
    [2013-02-07 19:42:56 GMT] NetWatcherFallback: Syncing with ian.james.campbell DesktopAnnex web 
    fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'xmpp'
</pre>
on zakaz and dagon.

hastur does not have these messages in daemon.log but I just had to restart the assistant because it seems to have crashed. daemon.log.1 ends:
<pre>
    [2013-02-03 14:07:51 GMT] NetWatcherFallback: Syncing with ian.james.campbell DesktopAnnex web 
    fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'xmpp'
    git-annex: <socket: 99>: hPutBuf: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
    git-annex: forkProcess: interrupted
</pre>

zakaz is stuck at commit 81768b7, dagon and hastur have 8240e2b, with a few commits in between:
<pre>
$ git log --oneline 81768b74892ee5ec7f5a9ae15fb65d81c8a4d29d^..master

Before all the \"cannot find remote helper messages\" in zakaz's daemon.log I see:

The last 3 lines are repeated, interspersed with the daily sanity checks (no errors).

It seems like something was up here but it recovered? All 3 managed to sync on 81768b7.

Next on hastur I see:

(5e83708 is 81768b7~2)

However there is nothing in the logs on zakaz about moving on from 81768b7. The last interesting message is the \"[2013-01-30 15:48:10 GMT\" one above.

is the XMPP peering supposed to be fully connected (i.e. each node is talking to both the others) or would it be expected that one of the nodes would be in the middle of the other two acting as a relay?

I'm wondering about that because hastur is frequently suspended. I can't quite remember but I think when I set this up I peered dagon<->hastur at home and then while I was at work I peered zakaz<->hastur.  That would seem to suggest that hastur would have ended up as the man in the middle. TBH I can't quite recall what the setup process involves, so maybe I'm talking nonsense. I think I went into the \"Share with a friend\" page and shared with myself.
