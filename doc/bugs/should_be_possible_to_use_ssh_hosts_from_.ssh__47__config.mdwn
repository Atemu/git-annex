I am using a ssh-host configured in .ssh/config in a corporate-environment like this:

Host home
	Hostname 1.2.3.4
	Port 443
	ProxyCommand corkscrew proxy.fqdn 8080 %h %p ~/.authfile
        # http://www.agroman.net/corkscrew/

I now want to be able to add this host as a remote repository, but don't have the ability to add it. A tunnel to localhost would be possible but then I would have to setup this portforwarding for git-annex separately every time it is started.

Is it possible to use this predefined host, or add the possibility to configure git-annex like above?
