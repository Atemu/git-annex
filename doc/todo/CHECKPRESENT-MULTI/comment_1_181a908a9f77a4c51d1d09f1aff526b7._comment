Beyond individual large files, maybe this could speed up checking that a whole directory is present in an export remote, by using a command like [`gsutil ls`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/ls) to list the present files, instead of calling [`gsutil stat`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/stat) on each file individually.
