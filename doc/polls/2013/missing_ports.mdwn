git-annex runs on many operating systems:
Linux, OS X, BSDs, Android, and Windows.
However, some ports are further along than others. 

If there's a device on which you cannot use git-annex today, because the
port to an OS is missing or incomplete, please pick it. Please don't vote
for an OS where you already successfully use git-annex.
