This is very strange behavior for gpg, it's being told several ways not to be interactive (--batch, --no-tty, --passphrase-fd); the mode it's being run in should, even without those options, only prompt for a password.

I'm left wondering what settings you have in gpg.conf, and even wondering if you have some kind of wrapper around gpg that makes it more interactive, or some odd gpg agent that's interactive, or something.

(I'm also confused that you mention a \"gpg>\" prompt, but your transcript doesn't show one.)
