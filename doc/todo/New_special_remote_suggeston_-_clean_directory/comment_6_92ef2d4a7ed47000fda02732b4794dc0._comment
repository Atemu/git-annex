The other problem with this idea is that it seems to want the assistant to watch the file tree in the NAS, and make commits etc when files there are changed.

But, any computer on the network that has the NAS mounted can change a file! AFAIK there is no interface to detect when such changes have happened; inotify does not help. It seems git-annex would have to expensively periodically scan the directory to find changes.
