### Please describe the problem.

Beginning with 8.20200522, importfeed replaces all dot (".") characters in filenames with "_". As an example, before that release, the TWIT Security Now podcast had filenames that looked like this:

SN_767__WiFi_6.mp3

After the release, the filenames look like this:

SN_769__Zoom_s_E2EE_Design_mp3

This change occurred across all my downloaded podcasts. 

I suspect the bug has something to do with the following changes described in the news for 8.20200522:

- addurl, importfeed: Avoid adding filenames with leading '.', instead it will be replaced with '_'.
- addurl, importfeed: Allow '-' in filenames, as long as it's not the first character.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

git-annex importfeed --fast http://leoville.tv/podcasts/sn.xml

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Arch Linux

git annex version 8.20200720.1-g1ccb6699a1
