I chose readonly=true to be consistent with the annex.readonly git config
values. This is inconsistent with some other initremote stuff that uses
foo=yes.

I should probably make everything accept everything, which seems to be
approximately what git-config does, but too much bother for now.

Indeed, WHEREIS is not useful for encrypted (or chunked) special remotes.
I've made it not be used in those cases.
