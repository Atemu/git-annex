### Please describe the problem.
While trying to diagnose [[bugs/armel_standalone:_git-upload-pack_and_-receive-pack_not_shimmed/]] I updated the version of the standalone git-annex on Server A from 3.20121017 to the latest not daily build.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. download git-annex standalone for amd64 (I did both the normal not-daily build, and the daily build, same thing in both)
2. extract
3. ./runshell

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Debian amd64 (yes... I know, blame asheesh)

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
greg@rose:~/bin/git-annex.linux$ ./runshell 
exec: 2: /home/greg/bin/git-annex.linux/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: not found

### Indeed a dupe ###
Thanks clacke, [[done]] - Greg
