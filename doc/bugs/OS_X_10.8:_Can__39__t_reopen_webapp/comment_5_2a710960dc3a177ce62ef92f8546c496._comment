Joey: Success!  I was able to get things working properly by backgrounding the app by adding `&` at the end of `git-annex-webapp` like you suggested.

After doing that, I am able to relaunch the OS X app as many times as I want, and each time I get a new tab in my browser as desired.

I guess if it's left in the foreground, OS X thinks \"there's already an instance of that app running\" and does nothing.  If it were a GUI app, it would focus the GUI app in that case, but with a shell script there's nothing really for it to do, so that sort of explains the behavior.
