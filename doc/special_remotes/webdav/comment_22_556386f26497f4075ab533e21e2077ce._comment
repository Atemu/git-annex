Well, better two packagers than zero :-)

If I figured out what happened, it was my question here that prompted Joey to update git-annex to make WebDAV a requirement, which in turn prompted you to package the new dependencies in order to update the package in Guix. Complaint-driven packaging ;-)

It wasn't a waste of time either, because at that occasion I found out that the Guix infrastructure for Haskell code is very nice. I hadn't done much more than import the packages from Hackage.
