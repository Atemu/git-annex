My guess would be there could be some place where git-annex runs git-annex
as a child process, itself, but does not pass along the git config set with -c.

So you might try setting annex.alwayscommit=false in .git/config
and overriding it true when you do want to commit and see if that avoids
the problem.

Just thinking about it, I noticed that new code in Annex.TransferrerPool to
run [[todo/git-annex_transferrer_does_not_propigate_-c]]. That's certainly
not what you ran into, but there are probably others, and maybe one of them
is somehow windows specific. git-annex smudge which gets run indirectly
by git would be the obvious guess, although it does avoid committing on
shutdown at least.

However, the other thing is that "alwayscommit=false" does not really imply
"never commit in any circumstances". It just means, don't commit every time
some new data has been logged. In particular, Annex.Branch.updateTo' may
need to update the index due to the git-annex branch having gotten ahead of
the index. If there are uncommitted journalled changes, it unconditionally
commits in that situation. I don't know if I would consider that a bug.
Since you have a new repo, it's not that either. There might be other cases
like that, although I don't know why you'd only see it happening on windows.
