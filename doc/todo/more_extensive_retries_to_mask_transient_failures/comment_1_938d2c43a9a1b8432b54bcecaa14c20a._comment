As a concrete example, if the `index.lock` file exists and has relatively recent mtime and a git process is running, it would help if git-annex could be configured to retry, up to a given number of times with increasing delays between retries, the operation that failed because the index is locked.

Also, from the log
[[!format sh \"\"\"
add metadata_orig.json ok
(recording state in git...)
fatal: Unable to create '/ssd/crogrun_191008_043145__8684__/viral-ngs-benchmarks/.git/index.lock': File exists.
\"\"\"]]

it looks like the index.lock conflict is due to writing the [[git-annex branch|internals/#The_git-annex_branch]]?  I thought git-annex used a separate index for that?
