### Please describe the problem.

I am running an initial export to my NAS over WebDAV. The repo contains many small files and it already runs for a day. Even the smallest file takes around a second to upload.

Looking at strace and the code, it seems that for each file, git annex not only establishes a complete new TCP connection, it even also reads the credentials from .git/annex/creds for each file.

Are there ways to make WebDAV faster?
Could http connections be reused?
Could multiple files be uploaded in parallel?

Apparently files are also upload to a temporary location and renamed after successful upload. This adds additional latency and thus parallel uploads could provide a speed up?
