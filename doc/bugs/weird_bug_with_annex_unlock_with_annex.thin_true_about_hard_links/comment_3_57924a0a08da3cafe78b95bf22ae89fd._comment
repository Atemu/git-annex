annex.thin will only make one hard link to a given annex object file, so if
the file that is not getting hard linked has the same content as another
file in the repository that is getting hard linked, that explains why.

It would be very susprising for two different files in the repo to end up
hard linked together and then a modification to one change both files.

You should really upgrade to git-annex 7.x when using v7 mode. You
are both using versions that are missing quite a lot of the fixes needed to
get v7 to release quality. 
So please upgrade to a current version and see if your execute bit problems
persist there.
