I was looking for a good way to archive files to Glacier, and git-annex seems like an excellent approach.

After struggling for a while with the glacier-cli project, I just don't feel that it is well maintained.

 - I have to manually symlink it in place of its dependency's glacier binary.
 - There are patches to boto that are required for it to work, which are have never been merged. And it seems from the errors I am getting that similar edits are now required in many more places.
 - It is locked into supporting only an older version of boto.

That just seems like not a great place to be starting out with an archiving project.

I was wondering if you thought it might be feasible to get rid of that dependency with something else, perhaps this haskell aws project that seems to be actively maintained?
