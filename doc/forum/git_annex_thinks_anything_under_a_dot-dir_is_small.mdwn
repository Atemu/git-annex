The git annex repo seems to be assuming anything under a hidden directory is non-large and thus is putting it in .git instead of .git/annex

```
mkdir ...git.annex.test...
cd ...git.annex.test...
git init
git annex init
cp ../...directory.with.binary.files.small.and.large.../ . -r
# git config annex.largefiles anything # (this seems to have no affect to the operation below)
git annex add . 
...
... (non-large file; adding content to git repository)
...
```

this only affects content under a dot-directory, is this expected?
