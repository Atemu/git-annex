The browser doesn't crash, it stays up, though the git annex page disappears (replaced by the usual \"connection refused\" page from firefox) after a few seconds (ie. \"git annex webapp\" starts the browser, the git-annex page appears for a few seconds, and then it disappears as git-annex crashes, leaving the browser still running).

The latest daily build appears to work now though: git-annex version: 5.20140101-gf9e5218, so that seems to have done the trick.
