Hi Joey,

thanks for helping.
Unfortunately, installation with arm64 fails with something that 64bit executables are not supported.
using \"armel\" installation seems ok, (\"git-annex is sucessfully installed; installation complete\")

but then \"git annex webapp\" gives
git: 'annex' is not a git command

using \"arm\" (without the \"el\") gives Error 404 on downloading, so I guess you really meant \"armel\" (32 bits)

Til
