I see the problem always i start the assistant. Even when i don't touch the repository otherwise. But there is a funny observation: I have multiple seperate repositories: there are two old ones, that were created some months ago (upper bound: one year). Those two (seperate) repositories show the addWatch problem (on multiple machines). A newly created repository does not show the problem.

So i suspect that those old repositories behave in some direction differently. Is this possible? I could also give you a clone of one repository.
