My first concern is if this means it's insecure. Luckily it seems not; HMAC SHA1 needs only 64 bytes of entropy, which are more than provided in the 256 bytes of base64 provided. As long as both gpg and the HMAC code use the full provided key (and not just the first 64 bytes of it, say), we're ok. And as far as I can tell, both do fully consume and use the key.

So, I don't feel the need to change the code, aside from some minor improvements to variable names.
