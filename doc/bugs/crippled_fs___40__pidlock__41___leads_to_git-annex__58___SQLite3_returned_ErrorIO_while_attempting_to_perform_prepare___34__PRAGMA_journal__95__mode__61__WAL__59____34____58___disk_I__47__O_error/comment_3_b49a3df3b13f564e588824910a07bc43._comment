Just thought I would chime in that I experienced sqlite errors for about 2 months before realizing it was due to 9P filesystem + virtio in a Qemu VM. Prior to (roughly) 2 months back I did not encounter this error, but it now appears in all recent versions of git-annex (Arch Linux package, most recent standalone version, and git build).

Is there any way to alter the sqlite config (e.g., through .git/config or a dotfile) to workaround the issue? It renders my current setup, in which several VMs share the same hardware but have exclusive access to storage devices, completely inoperable.
