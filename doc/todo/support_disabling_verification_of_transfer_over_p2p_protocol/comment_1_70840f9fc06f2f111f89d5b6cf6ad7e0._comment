A quick check with `openssl speed -evp sha256` (and `-evp sha512`) shows SHA-256 is ~210MB/sec and SHA-512 ~275MB/sec on my not that recent i7 930. I'm sure its more of an issue on embedded or phones... but there of course the network is often slower. If the hash is faster than the transfer, seems like it shouldn't really cause that much of a slowdown (unless I guess its competing with ssh for CPU time, but that seems unlikely on multi-core machines).

I wonder if a easier way to speed it up wouldn't be to support BLAKE2 as a backend. Wouldn't help with existing hash keys, of course (without a migrate).
