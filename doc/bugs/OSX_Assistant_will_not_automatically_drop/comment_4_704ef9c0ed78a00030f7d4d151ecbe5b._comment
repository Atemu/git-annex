So [bare repositories](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bare_repositories/) should work fine with Assistant.

You said `it is bare and will not allow me to start an assistant on it`. Do you get an error message from the webapp?

What happens if you manually add the path to your bare USB drive repo to the `~/.config/git-annex/autostart` file, then run `git-annex assistant --autostart`? Then is assistant running on it?
