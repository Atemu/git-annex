Wow, I implemented your --buffer trick, and `get --all`
is over 2x faster. `sync --content --all` somewhat less, but still
another decent improvement there. (cold cache timings)

And some warm cache times are *much* faster than my cold cache benchmarks.
`get --all` is 17x faster in a 10k file repo, which makes it only 3x slower
than `get` without --all.

I think I will still leave this open because it's still worth considering
sqlite caching or finding a way to speed up the second sync --all pass...
but would be interested to know how your use case is improved now.

Please feel free to find optimisations anytime, I really appreciate it.
