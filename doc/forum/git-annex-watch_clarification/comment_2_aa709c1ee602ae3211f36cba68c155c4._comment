\"The assistant handles copying files to other remotes, so use it instead of watch if you want that\" -- but the assistant is a GUI, right?  My use case has to run in batch mode.  I just run [[`git-annex-sync`|git-annex-sync]] periodically.  I assume it's ok to both do that and have [[`git-annex-watch`|git-annex-watch]] running in the background?
