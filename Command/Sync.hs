{- Pushes a regular branch like master to a remote. Also pushes the git-annex
 - branch.
 -
 - If the remote is a bare git repository, it's best to push the regular 
 - branch directly to it, so that cloning/pulling will get it.
 - On the other hand, if it's not bare, pushing to the checked out branch
 - will fail, and this is why we push to its syncBranch.
 -
 - Git offers no way to tell if a remote is bare or not, so both methods
 - are tried.
 -
 - The direct push is likely to spew an ugly error message, so stderr is
 - elided. Since git progress display goes to stderr too, the sync push
 - is done first, and actually sends the data. Then the direct push is
 - tried, with stderr discarded, to update the branch ref on the remote.
 -
 - The sync push forces the update of the remote synced/git-annex branch.
 - This is necessary if a transition has rewritten the git-annex branch.
 - Normally any changes to the git-annex branch get pulled and merged before
 - this push, so this forcing is unlikely to overwrite new data pushed
 - in from another repository that is also syncing.
 -
 - But overwriting of data on synced/git-annex can happen, in a race.
 - The only difference caused by using a forced push in that case is that
 - the last repository to push wins the race, rather than the first to push.
 -
 - The sync push will fail to overwrite if receive.denyNonFastforwards is
 - set on the remote.
