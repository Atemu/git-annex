Hmmm, yes, my solution above wouldn't handle de-duplication of the same file in multiple folders. I have a one thought that might work (I can't test right now):

Use [proot](https://github.com/termux/proot) inside termux to [bind a path](https://github.com/proot-me/PRoot/blob/master/doc/proot/manual.txt) `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/annex-photos` to a mount point `~/storage/pictures/annex`. Then perhaps symlinks within annex-photos will be presented as files at `~/storage/pictures/annex` without increasing actual storage.
