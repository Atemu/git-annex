after (re)reading the following:

https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/switching_backends/

https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/migrated_files_not_showing_up_in_unused_list/

I confirmed again that git annex sync was re-ran, there are no remotes, so that isn't a thing here. I checked out each git branch and did a 

```find ./???/ -lname '*c0ade___this_is_a_long_hash___566fd3*'```

and nothing in any branch is pointed to this old backend key. 

so I am both stymied and befuddled... any tips are appreciated.
