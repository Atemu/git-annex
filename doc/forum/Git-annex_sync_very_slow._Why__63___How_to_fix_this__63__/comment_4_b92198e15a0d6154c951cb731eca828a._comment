> Also, [ZFS doesn't seem to perform too well with git-annex](https://www.datalad.org/test_fs_analysis.html).

The results of that test should be taken with a grain of salt. That test used ZFS version 0.6.4 from 2015. In the following 6 years ZFS went through three major releases (0.7, 0.8, 2.0) with many improvements.

My personal experience is that ZFS RAID-Z2 on spinning disks with L2ARC is only marginally slower than LVM-based RAID6 (but plenty safer and more versatile).
