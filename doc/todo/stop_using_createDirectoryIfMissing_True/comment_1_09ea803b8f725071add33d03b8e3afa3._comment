Implemented createDirectoryUnder, now just have to change every
createDirectoryIfMissing True to it.. There are only 75 of them so not
super bad?

Also, of course, some library might use it, but I doubt any that do
create directories inside the git repo, more likely they would be creating
tmp dirs or stuff like that.
