My main uncertaintly about this personally has been: Why should `git add`
add the file unlocked, and `git annex add` add the file locked? If `git add`
adds the file to the annex, it must add it unlocked (due to git's
interface). But `git-annex add` could behave the same as `git add` does.
(And it can if you set annex.addunlocked.)

The only half way good reason seems to be, sometimes we want the file added
unlocked and sometimes locked, and this provides commands available by default
with no configuration, and no added switches, for both use cases.
