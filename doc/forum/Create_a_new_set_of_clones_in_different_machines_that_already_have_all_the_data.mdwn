Hello.

I've been looking for a while, but I can't find any documentation for my use case.

Currently I have several TiB of information synchronized in different geographic locations with Bittorrent Sync.

I want to switch to git-annex for this purpose, but given the amount of data and the relatively slow pipes between the boxes, a standard init-clone-get flow would take weeks to complete.

Is there a way to create the clones separately on each box, so there's no need to redistribute already distributed data?

Thanks in advance,
Fer.
