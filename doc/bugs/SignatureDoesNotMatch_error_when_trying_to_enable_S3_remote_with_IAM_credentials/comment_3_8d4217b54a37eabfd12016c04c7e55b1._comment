Well, looks like git-annex is using the IAM credentials you're providing.

You could try to use a different S3 client on
the same bucket to check if the credentials are good.

This may be a problem with the credentials not allowing some actions,
like creating a bucket. Which is the action git-annex is failing at.

The bucket does already exist, right? Does it contain an "annex-uuid"
file? Does that file contain "a7e22956-5ce2-11e2-97a5-6f33220ffbf3"?
