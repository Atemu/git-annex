Had a repo exhibit this behavior just now:

- commit graph `XX -> YY`
- host `A` @ commit `YY`
- host `B` @ commit `XX` (1 behind)
- remotes `hub` and `lab` both @ commit `XX`
- `B` pushes and pulls from both `hub` and `lab`: OK
- `A` pushes to `hub` (updates to commit `YY`): OK
- `B` pulls from `hub`: FAIL with *Packfile does not match digest*
- `B` pulls from `lab`: OK
- `B` pushes to `hub`: FAIL with *Packfile does not match digest*
- `A` pulls from `hub`: OK
- `A` pulls from `lab`: OK

When looking in `.git/config` I noticed that `remote.hub.gcrypt-id` and `remote.lab.gcrypt-id` were identical.

To fix, I:

- removed `remote.hub.gcrypt-id` from `.git/config` on both `A` and `B`
- deleted and re-created a blank repo on `hub`
- `git push hub` on `B`
- `git pull hub master` on `A`

This resulted in a new and unique value for `remote.hub.gcrypt-id`, which is the same on both `A` and `B`.

Have not had time to dig into why but this is the only thread I can find about this problem so I figured I would log this somewhere for posterity.
