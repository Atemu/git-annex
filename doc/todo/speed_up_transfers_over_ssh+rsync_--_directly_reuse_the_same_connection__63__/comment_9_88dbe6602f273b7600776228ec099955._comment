I think that any further improvements here would need to be a fundamental 
change, rather than shaving away fractions of a second from the above
benchmarks. Most of the remaining overhead seems to be outside of
git-annex's own code.

I think it could use sftp, rather than rsync, when git-annex does not
need to resume transfer of a file. git-annex could keep sftp running, and
ask it for each file in turn, and avoid all the connection overheads.
