It would be possible for initremote to allow reusing a name that is used
for an old remote that has been marked as dead. The reason that is not
allowed, I think, is that there is some footgun potential: If the old
remote somehow was lost and then was found, it would either be hard to unmark
it as dead, or if that was done, there would be 2 remotes with the same
name, which would complicate using enableremote.

So it seems best to rename the old one before creating the new one.
That way it's got a unique name still.
