You're exactly right; the move command bypasses the normal numcopies check,
in a way that is otherwise (AFAICR) only ever done when using --force.

There's also no way to get exactly the behavior of a numcopies honoring
move. As you note copy followed by drop has that behavior, but all the
drops then happen at the end, which is clumsy. There's clearly a good case
for an option to make move honor numcopies if it does not by default.
I've added that as `git annex move --safe`.

I feel that the divergence from everything else in honoring numcopies by
default is important enough to treat as a bug, so I opened
[[bugs/move_violates_numcopies]].
