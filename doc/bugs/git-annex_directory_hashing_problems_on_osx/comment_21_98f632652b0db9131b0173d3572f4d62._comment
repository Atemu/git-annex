@seqq git-annex always uses the same case when creating and accessing the files pointed to by the symlinks. So it will not matter if it's used on a case-insensative, or case-insensative but preserving system like OSX.

You need to fix up the cases of the files in .git/annex/objects to what it expects. I'm not sure what would be the best way to do that. The method described in [[walkthrough/recover_data_from_lost+found]] might work well.
