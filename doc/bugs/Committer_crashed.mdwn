# What steps will reproduce the problem?

Editing a text file with vim

#What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

    # On branch master
    # Changes not staged for commit:

    #   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    #   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    #
    #       typechange: test
    #
    # Untracked files:
    #   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    #
    #       .test.swp

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

    /.test.swp still has writers, not adding

    Committer crashed: ./test~: createLink: does not exist (No such file or directory)
