## What steps will reproduce the problem?

install the latest linux snapshot of git-annex (http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/3.20121127/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz)

## What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect `~/.config/git-annex/program` to contain `/home/thedward/tmp/git-annex.linux/runshell`

Instead it contains `/home/thedward/tmp/git-annex.linuxrunshell`, which causes a problem next time I start the webapp (unless I manually fix it first).

## What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex=3.20121127 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS


## Please provide any additional information below.

Otherwise it is working great.
