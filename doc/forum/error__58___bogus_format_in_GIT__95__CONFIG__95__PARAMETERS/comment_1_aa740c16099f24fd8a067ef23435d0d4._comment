The git-annex.linux directory from the bundle does include a git, so if you
put that directory in PATH first, it will avoid the problem.

This should be a fairly transient problem, since the git-annex bundle is
built with the version of git from debian unstable. Once the new git
version gets released, it should fairly quickly get in there and the
incompatability will stop being a problem.
