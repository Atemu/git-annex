First of all thanks for `git-annex`! I have recently discovered it and was so pleased to see how it solves problems that I had not anticipated!

Related to [comment 26](http://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/S3/#comment-e2000bfcb5d4c2d1a017f52c1c02a1ba) above, I want to create a bucket in Frankfurt. It seems like the aws library used by git-annex is from [aristidb/aws](https://github.com/aristidb/aws) where the topic of `V4` signing was raised in [this issue](https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/167) ([comment](https://github.com/aristidb/aws/issues/167#issuecomment-258864661) by you joey?). 

Are there workarounds here? I can only use Frankfurt.

Thanks again!
