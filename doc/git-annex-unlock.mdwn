# NAME

git-annex unlock - unlock files for modification

# SYNOPSIS

git annex unlock `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Normally, the content of annexed files is protected from being changed.
Unlocking an annexed file allows it to be modified. This replaces the
symlink for each specified file with a copy of the file's content.
You can then modify it and `git annex add` (or `git commit`) to inject
it back into the annex.

# OPTIONS
