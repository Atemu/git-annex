What steps will reproduce the problem?

As a default user i want to start git-annex assistent with

`$ git-annex webapp`

`git-annex: Not in a git repository.`

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I would expect the assistent to popup in a opened browser window.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Debian wheezy with git-annex version: 3.20130114

Please provide any additional information below.

Its working if i start `git-annex webapp` as root. I had the same error on previous version.
