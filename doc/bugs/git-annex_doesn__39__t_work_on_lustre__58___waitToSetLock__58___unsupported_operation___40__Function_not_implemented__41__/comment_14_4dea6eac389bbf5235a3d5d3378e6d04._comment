Adding to the crazy Lustre fun, check this out:

	$ ls -l .git/annex/
	total 56
	-rw-rw-r--  1 hess root 18387 Nov 13 14:35 index
	-rw-rw-r--  1 hess root    41 Nov 13 14:35 index.lck
	drwxrwsr-x  2 hess root 12288 Nov 13 14:35 journal
	-rw-rw-r--  1 hess root     0 Nov 13 11:48 journal.lck
	drwxrwsr-x  2 hess root  4096 Nov 13 14:35 misctmp
	drwxrwsr-x 88 hess root  4096 Nov 13 14:35 objects
	-r--r--r--  1 hess root    70 Nov 13 14:35 pidlock
	-r--r--r--  1 hess root    70 Nov 13 14:35 pidlock
	-rw-rw-r--  1 hess root     0 Nov 13 11:48 sentinal
	-rw-rw-r--  1 hess root    23 Nov 13 11:48 sentinal.cache

There are 2 pidlock files in that directory listing. 2 files with the same name.
I deleted one of them, and with no other changes, ls shows only 1 now.

	-r--r--r--  1 hess root    74 Nov 13 14:35 pidlock

Notice that the file stat has changed too.

So, Lustre has clearly thrown POSIX out the window, and then defrenstrated
sanity for good measure.

On the plus side, this may show how I can detect when rename() fails to
preserve POSIX semantics..

Update: Indeed, I was able to get git-annex to detect the doubled file
and so know that it can't take the lock.

I can't guarantee anything, but this is enough to close this bug.
