Sorry, it should have occurred to me that \"archive\", \"client\", and
\"backup\" in your initial post were referring to git-annex's standard
groups.  Indeed then, as you say, the desktop won't get the content
from the archive because, as a client, it uses this content
expression:

```
(include=* and ((exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*) or (not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)))) or approxlackingcopies=1
```

> Perhaps I can make a rule set myself that does what I want

I think that, for the desktop repo, extending the expression above
with something like

```
(not (copies=backup:1 or copies=incrementalbackup:1))
```

would do what you're after.  That should make the desktop grab the
file from the usb if it hasn't reached the NAS.

Here's the complete configuration that I think should be needed:

```
git annex wanted . groupwanted
git annex groupwanted client '(include=* and ((exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*) or (not (copies=archive:1 or copies=smallarchive:1)) or (not (copies=backup:1 or copies=incrementalbackup:1)))) or approxlackingcopies=1'
```
