@strmd I don't see how this change could have been much better
communicated.

git-annex ships with a NEWS file which is where this kind of
thing is documented. You should read it when upgrading.
The same documentation is included in the release announcement on this
website.

(Package managers should really provide a way to see news items when
upgrading software, but as far as I know only Debian's apt is able to do
that.)

This change was under development since 2015, and was discussed fairly
extensively in the [[devblog]] over the years. I don't expect many people
to follow that, but people who want to proactively influence git-annex
development can and do follow that.

The 2018 git-annex user survey intentionally opened off with a mention
of v7 repositories and linked to documentation that included the `git add`
behavior. I was trying to get the git-annex community to try it out
and provide feedback. Some did. Nobody complained about git add.

Throughout the past year or so, I saw evidence of increasing numbers of
users using v7 features. None of them ever complained about git add
behavior change.

Before pulling the trigger on v7, I solicited user feedback in the devblog
and elsewhere, and I did get some useful feedback that led to the
annex.autoupgraderepository config.

Anyway, if the git-annex community evolves in a direction that I can't
make large changes, including breaking changes when necessary,
git-annex will need a new maintainer.
