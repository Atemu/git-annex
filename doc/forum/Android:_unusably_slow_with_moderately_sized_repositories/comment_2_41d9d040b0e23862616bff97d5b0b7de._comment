And I forgot to add, sorry, that when after a long time (say, another 20 minutes) something gets downloaded to the Android device, it is the reference, not the actual file. And this I also do not understand at all. So it seems I need to issue the 

git annex sync --content

by hand. But I thought I do not need to. 

I think I am definitely misusing or misunderstanding git annex ;-(
