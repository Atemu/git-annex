There's a simple workaround, in fact. Make a git commit, any git commit.
An empty commit will do:

	git commit --allow-empty -m "git-annex is a little bit buggy"

git annex sync will be able to handle that commit, because it's not a
merge commit.

It looks to me like this bug does not happen when `git annex merge` or `git
annex sync --content` are used. There needs to have been a manual
`git merge`.

In the test suite, it happens after a merge conflict occurs, and
git add is run to resolve the conflict. When git-annex sync
is then run, it results in the problem merge commit.

Do you have another way to reproduce this bug?
