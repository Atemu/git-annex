Lack of support for \"dumb FAT32\" and \"dumb NTFS\" is indeed the reason  why most of the people in my circle of acquaintances do not use git-annex.

V7 and import/export tree should solve most the problems related to the synchronization.

One last issue remains, however: FAT/NTFS and POSIX have different sets of allowed characters in file names. To address this, git-annex should \"smudge\" file names when dealing with a FAT/NTFS remote. For example `Moby-Dick: or, The Whale.epub` should be exported as `Moby-Dick_ or_ The Whale.epub`.
