I'm not sure how this happened, as far as I can see, and based on my testing, `git annex upgrade` does stage the location log files. OTOH, I vaguely rememeber needing to stage some of them when I was doing my own upgrades, but that was a while ago, and I don't remember the details.

Your upgrade seems to have gone ok from the file lists you sent, so you can just: `git add .git-annex; git commit`
