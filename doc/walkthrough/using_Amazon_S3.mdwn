git-annex extends git's usual remotes with some [[special_remotes]], that
are not git repositories. This way you can set up a remote using say,
Amazon S3, and use git-annex to transfer files into the cloud.

First, export your S3 credentials:

	export ANNEX_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="08TJMT99S3511WOZEP91"
	export ANNEX_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="s3kr1t"

Next, create a bucket, giving it a name and a description:

	git annex s3bucket mybucket "my Amazon S3 bucket"
	s3bucket (creating mybucket...) ok

Finally, configure a git remote to use the bucket you created:

	git config remote.mys3.annex-s3-bucket mybucket

Now the remote can be used like any other remote.

	# git annex copy my_cool_big_file --to mys3
	copy my_cool_big_file (to mys3...) ok
	# git annex move video/hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov --to mys3
	move video/hackity_hack_and_kaxxt.mov (to mys3...) ok

An Amazon S3 remote works just like a ssh remote, except it does not have
a git repository at the other end, and it costs you money. :)
