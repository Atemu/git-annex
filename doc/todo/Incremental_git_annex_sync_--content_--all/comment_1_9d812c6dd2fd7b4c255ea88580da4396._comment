So I implemented this with an bash script, see [[here|https://gist.github.com/Lukey3332/203ea6f30d48323e7bd1d05c16b5da9c]]. It's a bit hacky, since `git annex sync` doesn't have `--batch` and even if it did, `--batch` can't work with keys. Instead it check out a temporary branch, link the keys to sync in a directory and then uses --content-of= to sync only the keys within that directory.

I'll use it with my repos and see if it works reliably.
