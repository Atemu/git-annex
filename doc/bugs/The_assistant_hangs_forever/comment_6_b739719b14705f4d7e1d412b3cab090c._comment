I can confirm I also get the error: 
curl: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libssl.so.1.0.0: undefined symbol: EVP_idea_cbc

What I mean by the UI is hanging is that after the last action, I can see that the page is never fully re-loaded. So to be more precise the reloading of the page never stops.

When I am bored waiting for the page to reload ;-) I can still use the UI in the situation I describe (left to assume the operation fails :-)

I believe @saironiq is right: the problem is related to the 64 bits version.
