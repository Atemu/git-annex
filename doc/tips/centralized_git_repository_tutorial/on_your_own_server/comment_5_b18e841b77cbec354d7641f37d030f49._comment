As usually, create a directory on the server, `git init`, then `git-annex init` there. 

Add that locally: `git remote add my-server-name my-server:~/my-repo`

`git-annex sync` locally seems to work fine and pushes data to the server. 

I needed to have this workaround before, because I could not get data from my laptop while on the server (I wasn't sure I had an open IP address for my laptop). This is mostly a basic thing in git, but I had errors with git-annex earlier and I try to be cautious now.
