Besides the cost values, annex.diskreserve was recently added. (But is not available for special remotes.)

I have held off on adding high-level management stuff like this to git-annex, as it's hard to make it generic enough to cover use cases.

A low-level way to accomplish this would be to have a way for `git annex get` and/or `copy` to skip files when `numcopies` is already satisfied. Then cron jobs could be used.
