A couple of times I have seen a git-annex sync -C . upload files to the
remote that are not part of the remote's preferred content. In the most
recent case, I had moved the file to another directory while the sync was
downloading a previous file. I suspect that the file being removed causes
preferred content checks to mess up. --[[Joey]]
