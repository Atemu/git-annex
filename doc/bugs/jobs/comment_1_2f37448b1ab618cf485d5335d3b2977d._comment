Reproduced by creating 10000 files and running 
`git -c annex.queuesize=100 annex add -J8`

Apparently it runs two concurrent git adds
when flushing the queue in some circumstances.
The smaller queue size must make it easier to reproduce;
without it all 10000 files get added ok here.

It's not specific to v6 at all.

Two worker threads are flushing their queues at the same time.
