I wanted to try it with a repository using v5 indirect mode. This tells me:

      Filesystem allows writing to files whose write bit is not set.
    git-annex: This repository seems to be on a crippled filesystem, you must use direct mode.

Is that the case with NFS4 in general or might the disk not be mounted properly?
