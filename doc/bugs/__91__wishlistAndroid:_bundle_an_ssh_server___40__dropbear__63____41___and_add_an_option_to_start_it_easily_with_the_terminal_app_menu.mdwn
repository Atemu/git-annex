### Please describe the problem.

quite often is desired to fetch/navigate through the git annex installation under git annex user, e.g. to fetch the log to be provided here for the "additional information".
Given already big size of the app bundling some lightweight ssh server should not be a major size hit, but would ease troubleshooting and bug reporting

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Android from Nov 18

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
