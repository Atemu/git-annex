### Please describe the problem.

This URL:
http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/OSX/current/10.7.5_Lion/git-annex.dmg
currently points to a DMG with an .app that has ctime/mtime of Dec 29.

After launching the app, the About screen says this:

Version: 5.20131230-g684f2e6 

> Nobody is autobuilding git-annex for old versions of OSX, which 
> is why the download page says, "**warning: not being updated any longer**"
> 
> So, not a bug, and nothing ca be done, unless someone steps up to run an
> autobuilder. You can of course build it from source yourself. [[done]]
> --[[Joey]]
