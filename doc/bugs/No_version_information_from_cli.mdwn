git-annex does not listen to -v, --version or version.

At the very least, it should return both the version of the binary and the version of the object store it supports.
If it supports several annex versions, they should be listed in a comma-separated fashion.
If git-annex is called from within an annex, it should print the version of the local object store.

Sample:

    % git annex version
    git-annex version               : 0.24
    default object store version    : 3
    supported object store versions : 2,3
    local object store version      : 2
    % 

The above might look like overkill, but it's in a form that will, most likely, never need to be extended.
