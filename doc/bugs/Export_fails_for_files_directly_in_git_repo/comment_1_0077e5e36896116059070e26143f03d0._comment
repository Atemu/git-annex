More information needed to reproduce this.

Normally adding a "file.txt" would not ever result in its key
containing a space like that. So, it seems to me you must have
already added a file with the same content to the annex, in a
way that caused its key's name to contain a space. 

(I guess you're also using v6 mode, that's the only way "git add" would
add the file to git-annex.)

Also note that the limitation on spaces in key names only impacts
exporting to external special remotes, so "exp" must be some kind
of external special remote. (I was not aware of any that
supported exports yet..)

Suggest you `git show a05faa1` and see what key it used, that will
make the above speculations a bit more concrete.
