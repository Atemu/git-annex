If you add enough files, annex gets past the first `(Recording state in git...)` and then breaks on only the last portion, so some files are added and some are only hashed:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
$ touch {10000..20240} 20242

$ git annex add {10000..20242}
[ . . . ]
add 20240 ok
(recording state in git...)
add 20242 ok
git-annex: 20241 not found

$ file 20240 20242 | sed -e 's/`.*//'
20240: symbolic link to 
20242: symbolic link to 

$ git status | tail -n 7
	new file:   20240

Untracked files:
  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)

	20242
\"\"\"]]
