The git-annex assistant creates a folder on each of your computers,
removable drives, and cloud services, which
it keeps synchronised, so its contents are the same everywhere.
It's very easy to use, and has all the power of git and git-annex

## installation

The git-annex assistant comes as part of git-annex.
See [[install]] to get it installed.

Note that the git-annex assistant is still beta quality code.
(And it's not yet in the released version of git-annex.
That will change soon!)

## quick start

To get started with the git-annex assistant, just run it from the menu:

[[!img assistant/menu.png]]

It'll prompt you to set up the folder:

[[!img assistant/makerepo.png]]

Then any changes you make to its folder will automatically be committed to
git, and synced to repositories on other computers. You can use the
interface to add repositories and control the git-annex assistant.

## command line start

The git-annex assistant will automatically be started when you log in to
desktop environments like Gnome, XFCE, and KDE, and the menu item
shown above can be used to open the webapp. On other systems, you may need
to start it by hand.

To start the webapp, run `git annex webapp` at the command line.

To start the assistant without opening the webapp, 
you can run the command "git annex assistant --autostart". This is a
good thing to configure your system to run automatically when you log in.

## colophon

The git-annex assistant is being
[crowd funded on
Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyh/git-annex-assistant-like-dropbox-but-with-your-own/).
