git is configured to filter the file through git-annex, so git does not
need to deal with the large content of the file.

But this error message seems to come from part of git that just stats the
file, and looks at its size. So there's nothing git-annex is configuring
wrong, and using git-lfs would likewise make git fail the same.

I don't think this is a bug in git-annex. It should be reported to the git
developers. The error comes from `xsize_t`, and according to git's commit 
dc49cd769b5fa6b7e0114b051c34a849828a7603 it was intended to detect cases
where git can't possibly malloc enough memory for a file, because `size_t`
is not wide enough, compared with `off_t`.

On linux amd64, both are 8. On linux i386 and arm, both are 4. So I don't
think any usual linux systems are affected by this, only unusual systems
that use different sizes for them.
