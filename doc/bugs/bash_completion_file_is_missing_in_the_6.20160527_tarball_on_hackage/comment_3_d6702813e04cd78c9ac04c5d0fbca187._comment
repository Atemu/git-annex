It could be that I made the wrong decision, but the tarball was being built
with hacks to include all those files before, and was still not complete
due to limits in what's allowed in tarballs on hackage.

The Makefile will be removed from the tarball in the next release, 
which should I think make it clearer that the tarball is not intended for a
`make install` situation.
