The scenario that isStableKey is being used to guard against is two
repos downloading the content of an url and each getting different content,
followed by one repo uploading some chunks of its content and then the
other repo "finishing" the upload with chunks of its different content.
That would result in a mismash of chunks being stored in the remote.

It's true that it could also happen using WORM with an url attached to it.
(Not with other types of keys that verify a checksum.)
Though it seems much less likely, since the file size is at least checked
for WORM, while with URL keys there's often no recorded file size. And,
WORMs don't typically have urls attached (I can't think of a single time
I've ever done that, it just feels like asking for trouble), 
while URL keys always do.

If this is a serious concern, I'd suggest you open a todo or bug report
about it, there are far too many comments to wade through here already.
We could think about, perhaps not allowing download of WORM keys from urls
or something like that..
