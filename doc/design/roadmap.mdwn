git-annex is in a mode of continual user-driven improvement, involving
numerous small issues and often easily implemented ideas.

# priority

Here are high priority bugs and todo items, tagged with 'priority'.
In the current crisis, please only add things that are either needed by
scientists using git-annex (for any reason), or by organizations working on
the crisis.

Note that several [[projects]] use git-annex for science and items tagged
belonging to those projects will be prioritized so do not generally need to
be listed here.

# confirmed

Here are open todo items that have been confirmed as worth doing and
seem to have a design ready:

and link(todo/confirmed) and !link(todo/needsthought) and !*/Discussion and
!todo/moreinfo and !todo/confirmed and !todo/needsthought and
