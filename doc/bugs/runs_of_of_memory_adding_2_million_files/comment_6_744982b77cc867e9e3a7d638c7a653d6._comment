Actually, it is in getDirectoryContents itself, so not even in git-annex's code. Filed a bug w/patch: <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/9266>

I do not feel this is serious enough to work around in git-annex with a fixed copy of getDirectoryContents, so I'll wait for that get fixed.

Testing with my patched getDirectoryContents, git-annex still uses up a lot of memory in this situation. It no longer blows the stack, but getDirectoryContents is still using entirely more memory than it needs to.
