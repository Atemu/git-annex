`git annex add --largerthan=200mb` of a new file
does not add a file that is large enough.

This is a reversion, introduced last year in
[[!commit 3066bdb1fb60e80f40b5badc150fb6eb51a922bb]].

`git annex import /dir --largerthan=100mb` is also affected, and has an
ugly fail mode as it tries to look up an annexed file outside the repo:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/t>git annex import --largerthan=100mb ../d
	fatal: './../d/foo' is outside repository at '/home/joey/tmp/t'

That commit was otherwise right, eg `git-annex get --largerthan` should
look at the size of the annexed file, not of the file on disk, which could
be a small pointer file.

Rather than being global options, --largerthan and --smallerthan, 
could added by each command, so the command can specify how the size
should be determined. Finding a way to do that w/o needing to add
boilerplate to many commands would be best.
