Thanks Joey for investigating this! It looks like I need to wait for WSL 2 to become available in windows public release. In the meantime I've submitted a bug on [faulty behaviour of `git annex add` on DrvFs](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/WSL1__58___git-annex-add_fails_in_DrvFs_filesystem/). I don't think you can fix it, as it is apparantly a WSL problem, but I think it's good to keep track of it and warn potential users
