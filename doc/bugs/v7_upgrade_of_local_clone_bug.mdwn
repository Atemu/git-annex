When a local clone was at v7 and gets upgraded to v8 by a command run in
a repo that has it as a remote, this is displayed:

"fatal: ../path/to/clone is outside repository"

This happens because git ls-files is run to list the files of the clone.
But, it has some strange behavior when relative paths are used. Result is
it always fails. This also causes the keys database of the clone to not get
repopulated after being deleted for the upgrade. That's not a fatal problem
because git-annex is always prepared for the keys database being out of
date, but it could result in considerably more work being done later.

I also found some v1 upgrade code that does the same thing, and presumably
also has the problem, although there are probably no v1 repos left. 
This seems like it could be a larger problem that only upgrades, but
luckily upgrades seem like the only time that git-annex, running in one
repo, needs to do anything involving listing the files in the working tree
of a remote.
