There are a few programs that look at filename extensions and when asked to
open a git-annex symlink, resolve the symlink and look at the extension of
the file it *points* to. Mostly such programs are on OSX I think,
although there may be one or two on Linux. The extension is in the keys by
default because of that insanity.

It might be that you could mess with your locale settings and get python to
manage to decode the unicode character.

Since it looks like everything that it makes sense to do in git-annex has
been done, and you opened the glacier-cli bug, I suppose I'll close this
one.
