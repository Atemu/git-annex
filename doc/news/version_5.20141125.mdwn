[[!toggleable text="""
   * Remove fixup code for bad bare repositories created by
     versions 5.20131118 through 5.20131127. That fixup code would
     accidentially fire when --git-dir was incorrectly
     pointed at the working tree of a git-annex repository,
     possibly resulting in data loss. Closes: #[768093](http://bugs.debian.org/768093)
   * Windows: Fix crash when user.name is not set in git config."""]]
