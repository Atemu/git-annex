I do not know that I did wrong when I tried a different CR2 yesterday, but your suggestion was correct! The `myLargeFile.CR2` is indeed faulty and all other files (CR2s as well as of different types) work flawlessly.

I should have noticed that myself by trying to open that file in an image viewer. Thank you very much for your efforts and help!
