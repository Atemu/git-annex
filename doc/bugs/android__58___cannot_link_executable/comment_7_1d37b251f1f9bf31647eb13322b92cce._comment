Even with gcc and ld wrapped to pass `-pie` and strip `-no-pie`,
ghc is not producing PIE binaries. Verified with 
"readelf -s git-annex | grep main", and the address for
main is a full address not an offset.

The same android gcc toolchain does produce 
PIE executables by default when building C code.

Unclear why..
