   * assistant: Fix OSX-specific bug that caused the startup scan to try to
     follow symlinks to other directories, and add their contents to the annex.
   * assistant: Set StrictHostKeyChecking yes when creating ssh remotes,
     and add it to the configuration for any ssh remotes previously created
     by the assistant. This avoids repeated prompts by ssh if the host key
     changes, instead syncing with such a remote will fail. Closes: #[732602](http://bugs.debian.org/732602)
   * Fix test suite to cover lock --force change.
   * Add plumbing-level lookupkey and examinekey commands.
   * find --format: Added hashdirlower, hashdirmixed, keyname, and mtime
     format variables.
   * assistant: Always batch changes found in startup scan.
   * An armel Linux standalone build is now available, which includes the
     webapp.
   * Programs from Linux and OSX standalone builds can now be symlinked
     into a directory in PATH as an alternative installation method, and will
     use readlink to find where the build was unpacked.
   * Include man pages in Linux and OSX standalone builds.
   * Linux standalone build now includes its own glibc and forces the linker to
     use it, to remove dependence on the host glibc."""]]
