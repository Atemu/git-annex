Thanks for the quick comment. I was already trying to build this on a clean cabal system.

However, as of 4.20130521.2, I now get this:

[[!format  sh \"\"\"
Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:

Also tried adding a --constraint='tls-extra<0.6.3' with the following result:
[[!format  sh \"\"\"
