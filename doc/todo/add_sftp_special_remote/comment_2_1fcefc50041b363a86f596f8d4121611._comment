This can be implemented as an external special remote in Python with a combination of https://github.com/althonos/fs.sshfs and  https://github.com/Lykos153/AnnexRemote .  Implementing using https://www.pyfilesystem.org/ would make a remote that works with a range of filesystems ( https://www.pyfilesystem.org/page/index-of-filesystems/ ).   I don't have time right now but maybe you can try.
