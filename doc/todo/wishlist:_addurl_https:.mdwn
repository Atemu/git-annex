It would be nice if "git annex addurl" allowed https: urls, rather than just http:.
To give an example, here is a PDF file:

 https://www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=59ba4c8aa59101a09827ab7b9a787b05

If you switch the https: to http: it redirects you back to https:.

As more sites provide https: for non-secret traffic, this becomes more of an issue.
