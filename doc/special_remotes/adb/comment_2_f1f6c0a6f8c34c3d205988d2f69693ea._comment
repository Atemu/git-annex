@iakornfeld, like all special remotes, the git repository is not stored in
the special remote, only the content of annexed files.

Using `git annex export` like in the example, the android device will
contain files with the same names as those in your git-annex repository.

If you want to use a git-annex repository on the Android device, see
[[install/Android]] instead of this. However, for pushing a tree of annexed
files to Android device and updating it, this special remote can be a good
fit.
