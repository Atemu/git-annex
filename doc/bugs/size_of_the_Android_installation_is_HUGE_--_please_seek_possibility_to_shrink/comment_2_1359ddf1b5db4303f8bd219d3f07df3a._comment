The git-annex binary is around 45 mb on Linux. The android binary statically links a few additional C libraries, so is slightly larger.

The only way I know of to potentially shrink it is to fix certian ghc / ld interactions that, in my limited understanding, cause functions that are never used to be linked into the binary if another function in the same file (or module) is used. That might half its size or something.
