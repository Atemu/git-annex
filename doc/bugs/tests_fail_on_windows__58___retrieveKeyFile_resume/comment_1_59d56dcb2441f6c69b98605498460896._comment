It's possible it had the same cause as the other failure, which I've now
fixed. That involved a file handle leak, and on windows a file handle being
left open for write is treated the same as the file being locked and will
prevent a later deletion attempt and also a later write attempt, which
could explain the two unlike failures.

However, the file that was left open was a temp file in the remote,
not the object file in the annex. So I'm not sure if it's fixed.
Also possible something else in the windows code path changed accidentially
during those CoW changes. Will have to see what happens when the
autobuilder runs again.
