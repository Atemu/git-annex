Wait... The import code has a separate "GIT" key type that it uses
internally once it's decided a file should be non-annexed. Currently
that never hits disk. Using that rather than a SHA1 key for the export
database could be a solution. 

(Using that rather than "SHA1" for the keys would also avoid
the problem that the current GitKey hardcods an assumption 
that git uses sha1..)
