remotedaemon --foreground speaks a line-based API over stdio.
So it does not make sense to use it the way you're using it.

It may be that --foreground should be renamed to something else, and a new
--foreground option added that just runs the daemon in its usual mode w/o
backgrounding. I think only the assistant uses --foreground, although it is
a documented option and there's always the possibility someone has found a
use for it.
