I can reproduce this problem on OSX.

I've only gotten as far as seeing that the gcrypt repository never gets initialized as a git repository. It has a config file, but no objects are ever pushed to it. This is why gcrypt sees no repository there in subsequent runs.

This is a bug in gcrypt, so filed: <https://github.com/blake2-ppc/git-remote-gcrypt/issues/15>
