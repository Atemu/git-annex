httpalso automatically enables exporttree=yes when the --sameas remote is
such a remote. The working tree of a regular git repository is not such
a remote, and that cannot possibly work. Use a directory special remote
with exporttree=yes and then httpalso will be able to access it, as is
documented.

To access a git remote over http, git-annex needs to be able to download and
parse its .git/config to determine its annex.uuid. When the http server 
and url are configured properly, that does work.
