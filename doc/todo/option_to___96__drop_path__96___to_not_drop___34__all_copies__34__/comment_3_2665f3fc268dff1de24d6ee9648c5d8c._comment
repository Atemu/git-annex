As a more general solution, suppose [[git-annex-matching-options]] were extended with the expressions `—includeifany=glob` (true for a key if *any* file using that key matches `glob`), `—includeifall=glob` (true for a key if *all* files using that key match `glob`), and similarly `—excludeifany/all`.  Then use `drop —includeifall=path/*`.
