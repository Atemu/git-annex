If the GCS remote is not configured to encrypt or chunk the files
stored in it, they can be accessed by other things than git-annex, but
the names of the files will be the git-annex keys (eg their hash),
which may or may not work for what you're processing them with.

If the thing you're processing them with needs to operate on
the original filenames, you need to use a remote configured with
exporttree=yes. Then you can use `git annex export master --to remote`
to make the remote contain a copy of the tree of files in your master
branch.

Not all special remotes support that feature. For GCS, there is one
option that does, using the S3 interface to GCS. (rclone and gcsannex do
not support exporttree)
