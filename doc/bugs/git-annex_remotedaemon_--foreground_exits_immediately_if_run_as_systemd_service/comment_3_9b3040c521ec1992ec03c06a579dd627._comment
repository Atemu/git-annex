As I said, the purpose of the --foreground option is to enable a line-based
protocol using stdin. The assistant uses that. Other things could too, I
don't know. It's a documented interface.

Yes, if you run the remotedaemon for tor, you typically don't pass that
option, and so it does not use stdin. But an option to run in the foreground
like that would need to be a different option than the already existing,
documented, and used --foreground option.

So, this is not a bug report, it's a feature request.
