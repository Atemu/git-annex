The git-annex repository https://downloads.kitenet.net/.git/ keeps track of
all the old versions, which get moved to archive.org eventually to free up
space on my server. So it would be possible to build such a page from the
information in that repository. Or just look up the archive.org url for
the version of the file that you want using git annex whereis.
