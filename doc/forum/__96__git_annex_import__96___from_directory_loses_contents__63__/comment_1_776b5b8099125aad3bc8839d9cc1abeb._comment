The conversion of the git file to an annexed file is a known problem, 
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/import_tree_annexes_files_that_were_exported_non-annexed/>

The failure to get the content of the file when that happens is a bug
though. (I think it may be a reversion as I seem to remember that working,
but I could be mistaken.)

It seems to be caused by an underlying inability to get the file:

	get file.txt (from test...) (checksum...) 
	  verification of content failed

Which in turn is due to a confusion between two different SHA1s.
When exporting a file stored in git, git-annex use the SHA1 git uses for it,
but that is not actually the SHA1 of the file, but of the file size and file
or something like that. Then when the file gets converted to an annexed
file, it uses a git-annex get with that same SHA1. But git-annex expects
the content of a SHA1 keyed file to match that SHA1, which is not the case here.

So verification fails, and that's also why importing doesn't get the content.

This is certainly a bug. I guess the best way to fix it would be to fix
the above todo.
