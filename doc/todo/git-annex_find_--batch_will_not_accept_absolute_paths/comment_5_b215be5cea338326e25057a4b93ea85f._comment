Most of it can be fixed by making batchStart make
files relative.

Other affected commands that do custom parsing of
batch input, so will need to make the file from it
relative themselves: fromkey metadata rekey rmurl

Also, `git annex info /path/to/file` fails for unlocked
files and works for locked files, because it does not pass
filenames through git ls-files. I think it's the only
command that does not, when not in batch mode.

(I suppose alternatively, lookupKey could make the filename relative,
but I don't know if that is the only thing that fails on absolute
filenames, so prefer to make them all relative on input.)

Ok, all done..
