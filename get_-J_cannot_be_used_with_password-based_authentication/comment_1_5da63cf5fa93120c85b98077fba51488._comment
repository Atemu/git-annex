Current status: It's implemented, but not for `GIT_SSH` yet.

`git annex get -J 3` seems to work well.

`git annex drop -J 3` sometimes (once per 5 or so tries) runs
2 ssh processes both prompting at once. For example:

	21555 pts/3    S+     0:00      |           \_ ssh localhost -S .git/annex/ssh/localhost -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=yes -T git-annex-shell 'lockcontent' '/~/tmp/b/a' 'SHA256E-s30--ec748fe42378798b82ddf4e6b3e778a0cbc5d76d458685af01dc1f09cc423eb7' --uuid ad19d177-519e-4440-a9c9-0c9cddd99db2
	21556 pts/3    S+     0:00      |           \_ ssh localhost -S .git/annex/ssh/localhost -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=yes -n -T git-annex-shell inannex .

The inannex is what's used to bring up the ssh connection, so
I don't immediately understand how the lockcontent could run before
the ssh connection is brought up.
