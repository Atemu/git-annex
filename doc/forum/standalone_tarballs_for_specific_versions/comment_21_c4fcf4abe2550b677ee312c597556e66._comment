Thanks! The version string printed by the latest `git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz` is 8.20210224-gf951847c6 .  Would it be difficult to adjust the release process so that the standalone version corresponding to the current [hackage version](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/git-annex) gets uploaded to [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/git-annex-builds)?
