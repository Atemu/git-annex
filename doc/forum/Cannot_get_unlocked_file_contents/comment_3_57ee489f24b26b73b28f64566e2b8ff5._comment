@Lukey: thanks for the tip. Will try this at some point with a new repo. For now I just copied the most recent version of the file from /annex/objects/ of my central repo. 

@joey: I am afraid I committed the hash-link contents: 'git annex get' didn't change anything. Still I have no idea how this could happen; I'll dig through the history and report back :)
