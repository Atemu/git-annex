If using Debian testing or unstable:

	sudo apt-get install git-annex

### Debian stable

git-annex is not yet in a Debian stable release, and nobody has backported it
(yet?), but the source can be built from Debian stable.

First, install build dependencies. Package names have changed since
Debian stable, so this must be done by hand, rather than by using
`dpkg-checkbuilddeps`:

	sudo apt-get install debhelper ghc6 libghc6-missingh-dev \
		libghc6-pcre-light-dev libghc6-sha-dev \
		libghc6-dataenc-dev libghc6-utf8-string-dev \
		libghc6-testpack-dev

Then [[download]] git-annex it from git.

In the `git-annex` directory, run `sudo debian/rules binary` to build
a `git-annex.deb`.

Note that S3 support will not be available when building on stable.
