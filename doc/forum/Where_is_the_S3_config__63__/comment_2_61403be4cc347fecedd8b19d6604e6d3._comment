This is a good question, because where git-annex stores information needed
to use a special remote varies depending on the special remote, and
is not really documented very well. But, you can work it out, by thinking
about the 4 ways git-annex can possibly store it.

1. The git-annex branch's remote.log file is used for most configuration.
   For a S3 special remote, it's almost all stored there, except for
   credentials.

2. Credentials, passwords, etc needed to access a special remote may be
   cached in .git/annex/creds/. The S3 remote stores 
   the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` there, so it will
   work without the environment variables set.

   (Sometimes this is also stored in remote.log, but only when you use
   embedcreds=yes and only when the remote's [[encryption]] makes it safe
   to do so.)

3. .git/config is only used for configurations that it makes sense be local
   to a given repository clone. For most special remotes, it does not make
   sense to store stuff there, but eg, the directory special remote stores
   the path there, because the path to the special remote can be relative
   to the git repository.

4. It can not store something, and rely on an environment variable being set,
   or some program it's using having a config file elsewhere.
