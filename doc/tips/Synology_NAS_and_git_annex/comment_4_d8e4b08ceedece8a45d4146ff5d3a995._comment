I'm not sure if I'm misreading this walkthrough, but does prefixing your key in authorize_keys file mean that the specific key pair can only be used in conjunction with git annex?

In other words, if I wish to have one key pair between my laptop and server, could I use that one key pair for both git-annex and simple shell access? 

What I'm seeing now is that the path to my **git-annex-shell** script is correct, but my server goes into high cpu and doesn't let me login when I try sshing into it.
