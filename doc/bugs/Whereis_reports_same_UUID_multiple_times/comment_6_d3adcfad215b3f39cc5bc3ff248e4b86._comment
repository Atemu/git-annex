Union merge on windows does indeed add \r onto lines. 

Looks like hashBlob is at fault; it writes a string to a temp file,
and the IO layer does CRLF conversion at that point. 

The git-annex branch transition code also uses hashBlob so would also
do it.

So I've reproduced the root cause of this now. Fixing..
