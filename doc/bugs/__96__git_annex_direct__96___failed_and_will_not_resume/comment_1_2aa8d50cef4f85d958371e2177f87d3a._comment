git-annex no longer supports direct mode in current versions,
so whatever code might have caused that behavior is removed.

The signal 11 is, however, suprising. If a current version of git-annex
segfaults, it would be worth filing a bug report and chasing that down,
although only after you test your machine's memory for problems that might
lead to a sefault.
