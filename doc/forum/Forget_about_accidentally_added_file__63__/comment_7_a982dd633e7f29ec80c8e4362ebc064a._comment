Marking a key as dead does stop fsck complaining about it, and necessarily
means there are no copies of it tracked. So it kind of seems to me that
meets the goal of "forget about the key's existance and stop trying to track
or `fsck` it"

I do think it would be reasonable to have git-annex forget --drop-dead
also remove logs for dead keys, but for other reasons: It would reduce the
size of the git-annex branch, and also eliminate mention of the key in the
git-annex branch's history. [[todo/forget_dead_keys]]
