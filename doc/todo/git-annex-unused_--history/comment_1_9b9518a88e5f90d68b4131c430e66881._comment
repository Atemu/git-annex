Alternate name, `git-annex gc` since this would be very analagous to `git
gc`.

I wonder if someone might want to keep all versions of files from one branch,
but only the current version of another branch? For such a person it would
be better if the interface was all in `git-annex unused`
as part of the `--used-refspec` with a way to indicate if past versions
of a ref should be examined.
