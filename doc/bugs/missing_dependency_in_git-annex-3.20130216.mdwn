What steps will reproduce the problem?

build git-annex-3.20130216 on OS X lion


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

successful compile; error was:

```
Annex/UUID.hs:30:8:
    Could not find module `System.Random'
    It is a member of the hidden package `random-1.0.1.1'.
    Perhaps you need to add `random' to the build-depends in your .cabal file.
    Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
```


What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

building git-annex-3.20130216 on OS X Lion


Please provide any additional information below.


adding 'random' to the BuildDepends in git-annex.cabal does indeed fix the error.
