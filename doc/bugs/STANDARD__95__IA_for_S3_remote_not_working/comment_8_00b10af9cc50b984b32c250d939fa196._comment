Thanks for checking. I am using Arch, and I just noticed that in the last week a new `git-annex` package was added to the official `community` repo (I guess you noticed too since I see that the [[Install]] page is already updated). Previously, I had been using a package from the AUR that repackaged the prebuilt binary, but now I have switched to the new package in `community` which is rebuilt by Arch's build service so that it includes the updated `aws` library.
