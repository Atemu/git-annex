This special remote type accesses files stored in a
[borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/) repository.

This allows retrieving annexed files from borg repositories, and since
git-annex knows which files are stored in a borg repository, it can be
configured to treat the repository as one copy of the file.

Unlike most special remotes, this is read-only; it cannot change what
is stored in a borg repository. You do that by using borg as usual,
and then `git-annex sync` will learn about the files that are stored
in the borg repository.

## configuration

These parameters can be passed to `git annex initremote` to configure the
remote:

* `repository` - The location of a borg repository, eg a path, or
  `user@host:path` for ssh access.

Setup example:

	# borg init --encryption=keyfile /path/to/repo
	# git annex initremote borg type=borg repository=/path/to/repo
