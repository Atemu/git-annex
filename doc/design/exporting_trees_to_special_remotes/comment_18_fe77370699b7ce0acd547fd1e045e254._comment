Changing VERSION would prevent any older versions of git-annex from working
with that external special remote, since they would reject the unknown
version. (The current parsing of VERSION also happens to preclude adding
some fields after the number.)

Since it seems completely possible to make the protocol be changed in a way
that is backwards compatible both ways, while still letting new features to
be used, I'd rather reserve changing VERSION for whatever future thing
needs a full breaking bump.
