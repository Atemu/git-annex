Any extension you pick to use would work fine; it's not a value that needs
to be calculated in a long-term reproducible way, and git-annex has refined
the extensions it picks repeatedly.

I'm wary about exposing a way for git-annex to calculate the extension.
It risks a slippery slope to exposing other internal details of how other
backends (eg URL) construct parts of their keys. Especially with the
external backends existing now.

This does generate the path to the annex object:

	git annex examinekey $KEY --format='.git/annex/objects/${hashdirmixed}${key}/${key}'

Except, hmm, when the repo is tuned with annex.tune.objecthash1=true
it does not take that into account. And if the repo is tuned with
annex.tune.objecthashlower=true that needs to be `${hashdirlower}` instead.

I think it would be a good idea to add something to examinekey that
simplifies this, eg `${objectpath}` that would exand to the full path.
Taking the tuning edge cases into account and also future-proofing the
interface.
