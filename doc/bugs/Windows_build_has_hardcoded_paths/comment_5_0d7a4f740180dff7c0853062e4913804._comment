Unlike under POSIX environments
generally applications under windows don't add themselves to path,
or to a directory already in path.

Generally applications announce their location using the registry.
Under either HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE,
or in case of software installed for one particular user only
under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE.

Git however AFAIK does not.
Most likely the best thing to do is to prompt the user when installing git-annex
where git is, and store this variable.

Note that in both my installs I installed git-annex into the git directory,
and the git-annex webapp still couldn't find it.
