### Please describe the problem.

This is actually two (related) bugs.
I discovered the second by means of troubleshooting the first.

One issue I've had with a portable repo is when I init it from my arch machine it sets up everything as expected.
When I try to use that drive with my raspberry pi, however, there are some new git hooks (or at least one) that the older version of git annex (still the latest available in the Pi's repos, 2016, which is really old :/). 

What is necessary to get a newer version of git-annex available in the Raspbian repos for default users? I know I can just install the tarball (and I'm considering it) but for everyone else coming upon this issue...

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
See above. git-annex init on a newer system, then mount it as a drive on a Raspberry pi (with the older git-annex installed) and set up the pi as a remote. Then git-annex sync.

Note: this is fixable by deleting the post-receive hook in the .git/hooks folder. I'm just not sure that's a great idea.

### Please provide any additional information below.

I've also noticed a bug with tab complete on the latest git-annex when in a folder that is not git-annexed. I was looking into git-annex post-receive, and typed git-annex pos<TAB><TAB> to get a listing of possible outputs. This was the result:



[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log

tai@trasa:~$ git-annex post-receive git-annex: Not in a git repository.
git-annex: Not in a git repository.

Display all 105 possibilities? (y or n)^C
tai@trasa:~$



# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

I did not hit enter, the script just failed on me during tab-complete and exited.

Thanks, I look forward to any response from the community this might get.
