@cardoso-neto \"The only dependency that was installed when I conda-installed git-annex was this\" -- do you by chance remember the exact commands used to create that conda environment, before you tried installing git-annex into it?  (Or if you have the environment, can you do `conda list --explicit` in it?) I'd like to better understand why `conda install` prefers the standalone package [so often](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/git-annex/files). I'll ask conda gurus, but first need a reproducible case where that happens seemingly unnecessarily.
