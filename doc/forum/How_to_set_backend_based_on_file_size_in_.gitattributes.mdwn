Hi there,

In my repos, I want files larger than 500MB to use the WORM backend. So when I'm adding large files, I do it in 2 passes. I first run this:
    
    git annex add --largerthan=500MB --backend=WORM .

to add only files larger than 500MB. The remaining files that are smaller than 500MB I then add using default backend:

    git annex add

Is it possible to set annex.backend in .gitattributes so that adding files larger than 500MB automatically use the WORM backend? Can I use expressions such as largerthan or smallerthan? From the example [here](https://git-annex.branchable.com/backends/), it seems that it can only be set based on file type. 


Regards,

Eric
