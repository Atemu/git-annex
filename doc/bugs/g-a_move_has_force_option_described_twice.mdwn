The **force** option in [[git-annex-move]] is described twice.

* `--force`

  Override numcopies and required content checking, and always remove
  files from the source repository once the destination repository has a
  copy.

  Note that, even without this option, you can move the content of a file
  from one repository to another when numcopies is not satisfied, as long
  as the move does not result in there being fewer copies.

* `--force`

  When moving content from a remote, ignore location tracking information
  and always check if the remote has content. Can be useful if the location
  tracking information is out of date.
