I keep a database file in git-annex so it stays synced across several machines. My wrapper when accessing it is basically

    git annex sync --content
    git annex unlock $database
    [access database]
    git annex add $database
    git annex sync --content

This works fine except it creates an entry in the log for the database file even if that stays unchanged. I would like an option that just returns to the state before `git annex unlock` if the file has not been changed. Maybe `git annex add --restore-unchanged`?
