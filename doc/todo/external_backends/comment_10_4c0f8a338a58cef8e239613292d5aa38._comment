\"the user trusts the backend program as much as they do the git-annex program, when it comes to whether a hash is cryptographically secure\" -- I'd trust git-annex more because it has many more users than any one niche backend program, so gets more testing and scrutiny.

\"just have a name registry on this site, first come first served\" -- seems fair; there may be more complex/robust solutions but doubt they're needed in practice.
