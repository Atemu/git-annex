### Please describe the problem.

i try to load add a URL to git (for later download) which is behind a CDN.
> git-annex addurl  https://cdn.media.ccc.de/congress/2018/h264-sd/35c3-9462-eng-deu-fra-What_The_Fax_sd.mp4

it tells me:

> addurl cdn.media.ccc.de_congress_2018_h264_sd_35c3_9462_eng_deu_fra_What_The_Fax_sd.mp4 (downloading https://cdn.media.ccc.de/congress/2018/h264-sd/35c3-9462-eng-deu-fra-What_The_Fax_sd.mp4 ...) 
> Configuration does not allow accessing https://cdn.media.ccc.de/congress/2018/h264-sd/35c3-9462-eng-deu-fra-What_The_Fax_sd.mp4
failed
> git-annex: addurl: 1 failed

looking around, I find that curl itself does also not load the file. wget does out-of-the-box 
hint: curl -L "--location" seems to work, as this follows the http 30x

--> how to fix this ?
