It seems to me the problem actually lies in that I installed the 64 bits version of Git 2.5, as I've tried to install everything on c:\ and the problem still isn't solved. But I think that the fact that the installer complains about Git not in Program Files(x86) is linked to 32/64 bits mismatch.

Once I'm installing Git 2.5 32 bits (even if my system runs Windows 7 64 bits), things are back to normal.

Hope this helps.
