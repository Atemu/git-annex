You can get the same effect by running `git annex vicfg` in 2 repositories at the same time, and adding different groups. When the repositories sync and merge, things end up in 2 groups.

So, this is something that git-annex has to deal with being done, even if the configuration does not make sense. It deals with it by treating such a configuration the same as if the repository was in no groups, as far as preferred content is concerned.

So, I don't see much point in adding configuration time checks, since they'd not catch all ways this can happen.
