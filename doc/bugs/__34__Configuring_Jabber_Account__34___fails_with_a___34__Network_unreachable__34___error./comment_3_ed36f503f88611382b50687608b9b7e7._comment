Seems like I should fix the standalone linux tarball to either include the host program, or better, build git-annex with the Haskell [DNS library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dns). (I think that the Mac app and other builds are built with DNS by default, since they have dependencies installed using cabal directly).

I need to first get that library included in Debian, so I can install it reliably on my build systems.
