### Please describe the problem.

After updating my Synology DS216+ NAS from [6.2-23739-1](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/releaseNote/DS216+II#ver_23739-1) to [6.2-23739-2](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/releaseNote/DS216+II#ver_23739-2), running `git-annex` with any non-trivial command, locally on the NAS or remotely on the NAS results in:

    git-annex: timer_create: Bad address

I'm guessing that this means that a library function the standalone binary needs is no longer present, but I'm unsure why.  The `-1` to `-2` update seems to only have two security fixes ([SA 18-36](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/support/security/Synology_SA_18_36), and [SA 18-01](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/support/security/Synology_SA_18_01) -- the latter being a Spectre/Meltdown bug).

Do you know if `timer_create` is a kernel system call?  Or a libc (etc) library function?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Update Synology NAS to [6.2-23739-2](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/releaseNote/DS216+II#ver_23739-2), run `git annex sync`, `git annex version` or similar (remotely or locally).

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

`x86-32`, stand alone build, for ancient-kernels, as that the 64-bit stand alone build [no longer seemed to work due to locale issues](https://ewen.mcneill.gen.nz/blog/entry/2017-05-28-git-annex-on-synology-ds216+/) (see note added at the end).

I believe it is `6.20180626`, but `git annex version` currently also fails...

### Please provide any additional information below.

    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$ hostname --fqdn
    nas01
    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$ git annex sync
    git-annex: timer_create: Bad address
    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$ 
    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$ git annex version
    git-annex: timer_create: Bad address
    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$

There is a [6.2.1 firmware release](https://www.synology.com/en-uk/releaseNote/DS216+) for the Synology NAS released a couple of days ago, but it does not yet seem to be visible to my NAS.  I can try that one if it'd help.

I can also try switching back to one of the more modern `x86-64` / `x86-32` stand alone builds if that'd help.  But then I'd need some assistance with working around the:

    sh: loadlocale.c:129: _nl_intern_locale_data: Assertion `cnt < (sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME) / sizeof (_nl_value_type_LC_TIME[0]))' failed.
    error: git-annex died of signal 6

error I was seeing on those builds.  (From other work elsewhere it feels a lot like the LC_TIME structure changed in size in some libc definition somewhere in the last 6-12 months; in another project we had a similar break on Ubuntu 18.04 issues which didn't affect Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier.)

In case it helps, out of the box defaults give:

    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$ echo $LANG
    en_US.utf8
    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$ ls /volume1/thirdparty/git-annex.linux/locales/en_US.utf8/
    LC_ADDRESS  LC_IDENTIFICATION  LC_MONETARY  LC_PAPER
    LC_COLLATE  LC_MEASUREMENT     LC_NAME      LC_TELEPHONE
    LC_CTYPE    LC_MESSAGES        LC_NUMERIC   LC_TIME
    ewen@nas01:/volume1/music/podcasts$ 

(although those files are currently generated with the now broken x86-32 legacy standalone build).

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Definitely.  It was working until I updated the NAS firmware image this afternoon... for this repository holding years of podcasts and many others.
