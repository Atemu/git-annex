Disregard that.  I was testing it with a particular file that didn't exactly play nice.

Basically, to test this before production I used `dd bs=1024 count=100000 if=/dev/zero of=bigfile`.

When I did a `git pull`, it showed the symlink as being valid.

When I changed the command to `dd bs=1024 count=100000 if=/dev/urandom of=bigfile` then it showed the symlink as bad after pulling.

Weird!
