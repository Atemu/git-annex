So, I actually see something a little similar when using runshell 
in the standalone bundle:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/a/git-annex.linux>./runshell 
	$ bash
	locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
	locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory

This is due to it setting LOCPATH=/dev/null,
so it won't even try to use the system's locale files. 
(Whether they would be compatable with the libc in the bundle is another question.)

So, `unset LOCPATH` may work around the problem. If you don't run into
the bug that is set to prevent, <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7695>.

This setting could be revisited once the standalone builds are built using
ghc 7.10, which fixed that bug.
