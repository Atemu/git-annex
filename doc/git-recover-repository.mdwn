# NAME

git-recover-repository - Fix a broken git repository

# SYNOPSIS

git-recover-repository [--force]

# DESCRIPTION

This can fix a corrupt or broken git repository, which git fsck would
only complain has problems.

It does by deleting all corrupt objects, and retreiving all missing
objects that it can from the remotes of the repository.

If that is not sufficient to fully recover the repository, it can also
reset branches back to commits before the corruption happened. It will only
do this if run with the --force option, since that rewrites history
and throws out missing data.
