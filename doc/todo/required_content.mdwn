We have preferred content, which is advisory, and numcopies, which is
enforced (except by `git annex move`). What is missing is an expression
like preferred content, which is enforced. So, required content.

For example, I might want a repository that is required to contain
`*.jpeg`. This would make get --auto get it (it's implicitly part of the
preferred content), and would make drop refuse to drop it.
