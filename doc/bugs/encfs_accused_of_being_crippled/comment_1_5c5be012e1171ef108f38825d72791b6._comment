encfs appears to not allow creation of hard links to files:

[[!format sh \"\"\"
joey@gnu:~/tmp/other_empty_dir>ln me me2
ln: failed to create hard link `me2' => `me': Operation not permitted
\"\"\"]]

According to the documentation, this is a limitation when using External IV Chaining. And only a problem if you choose paranoia mode when setting up encfs.

git-annex uses hard links in a limited number of code paths, most notably `git annex add` uses them when locking down files.

encfs seems like something I'd like to interoperate well with git-annex. So, it seems worthwhile to break out lack of hard links support from the other limitations currently lumped into \"cripped file system\". I've done so.

Also made it stop setting direct mode on bare repositories, although that configuration had no effect anyway.
