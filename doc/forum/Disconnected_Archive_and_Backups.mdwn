I am using git annex to sync a portion of my home directory. The main use/sync point is on my desktop and laptop. The desktop and laptop are connected to a NAS and usb drives.

So, the repos are connected like so:
       NAS - backup
          ^          ^
         /             \
desktop - client      laptop - client
         \              /
          v            v
          USB drive - archive

The idea is the NAS should get all files, the USB drive acts as an archive to keep the clients a bit lighter weight, even while off site.

Question:
If the laptop is used offsite with the usb drive archive and the laptop archives a file never yet seen by the NAS, will the NAS ever get this file? Note: the USB drive is never directly connected to the NAS and is not in its list of remotes.
