### Please describe the problem.

More of a feature request than a bug. It would be nice if when creating a local clone with git clone this would run automatically:

ln -s ../../annex/.git/annex .git/annex

to hook up the annex. Just a minor thing, but I'd be nice.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
