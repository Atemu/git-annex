The stats produced by `git annex info .` are nice but I often find myself separately looking up the actual numcopies set value.  Can this also be included in the report please?

<pre>
numcopies stats: 
	numcopies +0: 27
	numcopies +1: 43
	numcopies +2: 1
</pre>

<pre>
absolute number of copies:
	1 copy: 47
	2 copies: 23
	3 copies: 1
</pre>

> It turns out you can already get this display though!
> Just use `git annex info . --numcopies=0`.

<pre>
numcopies stats: 
	numcopies +1: 47
	numcopies +2: 23
	numcopies +3: 1
</pre>
