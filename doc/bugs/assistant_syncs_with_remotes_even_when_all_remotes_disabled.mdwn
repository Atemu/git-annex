### Please describe the problem.

I migrated a repo I set up by hand on my Android phone to use the assistant and webapp. That repo has two remotes, both full git-annex repos over SSH. I still want to control when I synchronize (cellular data is precious), so the vast majority of the time I disable syncing on both remotes. However, when I return to the webapp after it's been running for "a while," it shows a status message indicating it has synced with the remotes.

It looks like it might be related to the NetWatcherFallback, because a NetWatcherFallback entry appears in the log approximately every hour, followed by the usual repo sync output.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Set up a repo with a git-annex over SSH remote, and set annex-sync on that remote to false.
2. Run the webapp.
3. Observe after a period of time that the webapp shows that the repo has been synced.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 20130709 on Android (4.2)
