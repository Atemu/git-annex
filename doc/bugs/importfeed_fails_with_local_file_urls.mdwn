Hi,

I've a script which generates .rss files which reference local files with the file:// scheme. I can import the file:// urls with git annex addurl, but it fails with git annex importfeed:


`$ git annex importfeed --fast file:///path/to/local/rss/file.rss`

`(checking known urls...)`

`importfeed file:///path/to/local/rss/file.rss`

`git-annex: /tmp/feed6757: openFile: resource busy (file is locked)`

If I try to import it with `$ git annex importfeed --fast /path/to/local/rss/file.rss` I get

`importfeed /path/to/local/rss/file.rss`

`  warning: bad feed content`

`ok`

But the directory stays empty.


Is it possible to use local files in rss format with items which reference local files using the file:// scheme as input for importfeed?

Cheers,
Marco
