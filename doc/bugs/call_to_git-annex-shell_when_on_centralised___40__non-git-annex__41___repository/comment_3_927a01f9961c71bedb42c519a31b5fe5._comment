I noticed this:

> debug2: Received exit status from master 0

So, bitbucket prints an error message.. and exits successfully. Durrrrrr....

I'll put in a fix for this if I can. FWIW, the behavior is nothing to worry about; everything will work as-is, it'll just annoyingly keep trying to ask bitbucket to please identify its repository via git-annex-shell.
