The installer is running the command `uname -m` to find out what kind of
processor your Android device has. It doesn't recognize "armv81"

What you can try is to open the git-annex-install
script in a text editor, and add a case under `uname -m` for
"armv81". My guess is that this would work:

	armv81) arch=arm64 ;;

Or maybe this:

	armv81) arch=arm ;;
