Need to understand something. I just installed git-annex to my home PC, to my vps and to my office notebook. When I add the VPS as a shared encryption remote on both home PC and office notebook, they do not sync files. I tried assigning Full Backup and Transfer category to the VPS, but it did not help. The home pc and office notebook just sit there and do nothing to sync. For test purpose, I started with empty annex directory and started populating files on the home. It does sync to the VPS, but the office notebook is unaware of it and even if I try a manual sync, nothing happens.

On the other hand, if I start from scratch, add local repo's on both home and office ones, then add XMPP Account on both, then I'm asked to add cloud account, and once I do it on one end,  it appears on the other and when I enable sync, they start to work. However, this is not a good scenario as the work network uses a Proxy and as far as I understand, git-annex does not yet support it (did not find any options for it in the webapp).

So did I get right that an XMPP connection is required between indirectly connected repositories on different connections to be able to sync?  Ie a having a middleman computer with a repo is not enough.
