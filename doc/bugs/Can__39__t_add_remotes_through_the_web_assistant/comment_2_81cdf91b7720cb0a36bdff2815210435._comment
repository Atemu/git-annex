I'm on OSX 10.11.6. I started with a homebrew install, and today I found the native .dmg app. Could there be a conflict between the homebrew install and the .app?
I'm a first time user trying to test this program and not getting very far. I have a minimal understanding of git, and therefore shy away from the CLI.
