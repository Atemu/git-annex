Found a problem: it seems the portable version can only work in direct mode. Getting the \"fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree\" when trying to commit. Ran \"git annex indirect\". Got \"git-annex: Git is configured to not use symlinks, so you must use direct mode.\"

More info on direct/indirect mode: <http://git-annex.branchable.com/direct_mode/>
