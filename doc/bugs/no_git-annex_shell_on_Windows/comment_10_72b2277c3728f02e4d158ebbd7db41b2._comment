I try to use SSH to connect to Win10 machine with annex repo.
I am using the OpenSSH integrated into the Windows 10 (one you can install from Windows additional features thingy).

it didn't know git-annex-shell so i created symlink

    mklink \"C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git-annex-shell\" \"C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\git-annex.exe\"

and added ';.' to PATHEX

Currently git-annex-shell is found but i get error:

    Invalid argument `'configlist''

when i try to sync remote on that W10 machine
