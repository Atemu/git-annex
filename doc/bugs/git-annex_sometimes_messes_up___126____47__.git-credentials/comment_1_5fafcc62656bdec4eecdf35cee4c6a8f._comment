git-annex does not contain the name of this file in its source code.

In a few places git-annex uses `git credential` to ask for a credential.
Only in the git-lfs special remote does it ever `git credential reject` if
the provided credential does not work, which would remove it. Since you are
apparently not using that special remote, it does not seem relevant, but
also when git-annex does that, it's using it correctly to reject a
non-working credential.

It may be that git-annex ought to be calling `git credential approve` after
it's used the credential. It seems possible git might in some situation or
configuration choose to delete a credential that has not been recently
approved. The docs are not very clear about this, but I have not been able
to reproduce it behaving that way in some tests.

Or this deletion could be a git bug, or git could be sometimes seeing the
credential not work, for whatever reason, and so removing it.
