Ok, I see, http://git-annex.branchable.com/internals/hashing/ says that old vs new hash mess is deliberate, to make user experience better. (One might ask why one hash was replaced with another equivalent, but nobody would. Oh wait, it's a filesystem case sensitivity issue of course. But it's too secret to be mentioned on \"hashing\" page.)

\"unused --from=\" issue comes and goes, don't see it now. That initial issue of completely broken symlinks happened after running testremote, then breaking it (because it should say it takes hour(s) to complete). So, many users probably won't be affected (nevermind that those who will, will essentially have data loss).

Last issue I faced that somehow my local working copy gets \"bare = true\" each time I sync against remote SSH repo (which is bare of course, as remote repo should be).
