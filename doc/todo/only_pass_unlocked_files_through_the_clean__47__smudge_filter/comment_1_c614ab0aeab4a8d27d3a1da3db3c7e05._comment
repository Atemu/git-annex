It immediately occurs to me that the proposal would break this:

	git annex add foo
	git annex add bar
	git annex unlock bar
	git mv bar foo
	git commit -m add

Since foo was a locked file, gitattributes would prevent from being
smudged, so the large content that was in bar gets committed directly to git.

The right solution is to improve the smudge/clean filter interface to it's
not so slow, which there is copious discussion of elsewhere.
