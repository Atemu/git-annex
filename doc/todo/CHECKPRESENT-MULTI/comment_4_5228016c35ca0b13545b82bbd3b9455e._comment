I agree about the simplification. However, when resuming an upload with, say, 400 chunks where only 10 are missing, after CHECKPRESENT-MULTI-FAILURE, we'd need to CHECKPRESENT another 390 keys until we can continue. Sure, the remote could cache the replies, but another idea would be for the remote to reply with the last key in the list that is present.

Example:

```
$ CHECKPRESENT-MULTI a b c d e  # git annex calls CHECKPRESENT-MULTI with an ordered list
CHECKPRESENT-MULTI-SUCCESS      # all keys are present
CHECKPRESENT-MULTI-FAILURE      # all keys are missing
CHECKPRESENT-MULTI-FAILURE c    # Everything up to c is present, d is missing. e could be present or missing
```
