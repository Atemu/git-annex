Hi the fix works fine, all the tests pass now.  However I am having issues when trying to sync two directories.  I have had this working in direct mode in fedora but not in the previously mentioned windows install

2 directories d1 and d2.

SETUP:

cd d1

mkdir annex

cd annex

cp someFile . (as get branch issue if empty)

git init

git annex init d1

cp someFile . (as get branch issue if empty)

git annex add .

git annex sync

cd ..\..\d2

git clone ..\..\d1\annex

cd annex

git annex init d2

git remote add d1 ..\..\d1\annex

cd ..\..\d1\annex

git remote add d2 ..\..\d2\annex


SYNCING

cd d1\annex

cp someFiles .

git annex add .

git annex sync

cd ..\..\d2\annex

git annex sync

git annex mirror --from d1

It looks like the files copy across but when I look at them in explorer they are still just the place holders.

any ideas on what may be going on.  Does the work flow look correct?
