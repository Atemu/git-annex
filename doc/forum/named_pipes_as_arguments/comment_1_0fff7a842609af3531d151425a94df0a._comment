I doubt it?

The two way filesnames are used with git-annex commands are

1. The name of a file already checked in to the git repository,
   here git-annex needs to stat the file so I doubt a named pipe would
   work.
2. A file not yet checked into git which is going to be added.
   git-annex has to adjust permissions, move the file etc, as well as
   reading its content so again a named pipe wouldn't work.
