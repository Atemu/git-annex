3.20121127 is over a year out of date. You need to upgrade to a current version. I'd not be surprised if this is some incompatability with such an old git-annex and the rather new version of git you have installed.

Assuming a current version of git-annex still has the problem (which seems unlikely), run the command again with --debug and paste the full output.
