What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. create a git annex repo on a server
2. clone it on workstation
3. open the webapp on the workstation


What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The webapp should show the 'origin' remote and the assistant should ensure syncing.
Instead the remote does not show up in the webapp.
I checked with `git annex status` and the remote is there.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

3.20130207 on latest Ubuntu

Please provide any additional information below.

I tried both with direct and indirect mode for the local annex repo.

I am sorry if I am missing the point. I checked the docs, however without much success.
