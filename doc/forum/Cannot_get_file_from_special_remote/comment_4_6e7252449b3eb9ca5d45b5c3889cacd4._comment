It seems that the file stored in the remote must have either been deleted
by something, or possibly gotten corrupted. But probably deleted I think,
because a corrupted file would have a different error message.

Lot of possible ways a file could get deleted. Perhaps StorageBox is
storing the files as file on the filesystem, and had a disk problem that
caused fsck to move the file to lost+found. Could happen, disks fail.

Another way would be, if you had made a clone of your git-annex repository,
and enabled StorageBox in there, and done a `git annex move --from
StorageBox`. Then the clone would know it had the copy and StorageBox no
longer did, but until that clone's git-annex branch is pushed out to other
repositories, they will think StorageBox still has the copy, and fail like
you showed.

git-annex fsck exists because of these kinds of situations, and gets things
back to a correct state. But it makes sense to investigate what happened.
