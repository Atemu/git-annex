Thanks for answering, Joey. I was basically arriving at this. With the number of files and folders I'm dealing with, keeping the branches separated does seem to make the most sense. For less involved scenarios, having imported into \"orig\", a simple `git checkout orig /path/to/file` from master does the trick nicely.
