@ayutheos, can you confirm that running this git command fails the same way?

git checkout -B annex/direct/master

What version of git do you have installed?

(Note to self: This checkout happens when enabling direct mode.. Works for me in a new git repo made on FAT. This repo does not have a .git/index file, and the error message \"fatal: index file open failed: Invalid argument\" comes from git when it tries to read the index file.)
