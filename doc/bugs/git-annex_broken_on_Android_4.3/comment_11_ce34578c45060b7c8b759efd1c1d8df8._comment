I have a Nexus 7 (2013) with 4.3 that I'll test it on---I expect that my test will be successful.

I'll also run the test on my Nexus 5, running 4.4.

Getting git-annex working on 4.3 was the last thing keeping me from being able to ditch Dropbox entirely.  I'm so glad to hear there's some potential progress.
