9 months ago: [the annex] \"hook format a few versions ago, and this is using the new hook format\"
my Ubuntu 12.04:

    $ git annex version
    git-annex version: 4.20130516.1
    build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV Inotify DBus XMPP
    local repository version: 3
    default repository version: 3
    supported repository versions: 3 4
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2

I guess my \"git-annex version is still too old\"?  Any idea what version is needed?  Even better if I can figure out which Linux distribution/release has the most up to date version of annex.
