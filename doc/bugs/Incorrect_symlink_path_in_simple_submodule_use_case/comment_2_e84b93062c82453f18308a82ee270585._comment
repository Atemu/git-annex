chadsgilbert proposed to replace the .git file by a symbolic link:

 <http://stackoverflow.com/a/18238326/1531323>

What do you think of this possibility? Is it perennial? Can \"git annex init\" do it automatically?

The [commit message](https://github.com/git/git/commit/69c305178) that introduces the change gives the impression that a symbolic link was a possibility.

Thanks a lot for git annex!
