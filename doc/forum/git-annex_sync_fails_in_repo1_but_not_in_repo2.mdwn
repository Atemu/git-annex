Hello,

I am using two repos in direct mode that are connected via ssh.
Syncing fails in one direction but works in the other, I don't understand how to fix that.

## repo2 -> repo1 works:

    server$ git-annex sync
    commit  ok
    pull repo1 
    From client:~/media/img/db
     + be62780...2d74673 master     -> client/master  (forced update)
     + be62780...2d74673 synced/master -> client/synced/master  (forced update)
    ok
    push repo1 
    Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To client:~/media/img/db
       2d74673..be62780  annex/direct/master -> synced/master
    ok
    server$ git-annex status
    ? .t/repo
    ? .t/tmprepo0
    server$

## repo1 -> repo2 fails:

    client$ git-annex sync
    commit  ok
    pull repo2 
    
    fatal: You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists).
    Please, commit your changes before you merge.
    
    fatal: You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists).
    Please, commit your changes before you merge.
    failed
    git-annex: sync: 1 failed
    client$ git-annex status
    client$

Hopefully somebody knows how to fix that.

Regards,

Felix
