`git annex import` would copy data over from external places into the annex. It would be run from within the annex and in the target location where the files need to end up.

Two basic modes of operation:

* If run on a normal directory, e.g. an SD card, it would simply copy over and `git annex add $newstuff`

* If run on another indirect annex, it would copy over the symlinks, copy over the object data, verify that the checksums are OK and add to the annex

An optional `git annex import --copy-only` would copy over and verify the data, but not yet add it. That would allow the user to import into a decent data structure. If run on non-annexed data, `git annex import --copy-only` would ideally calculate checksums and create symlinks already; thus ensuring data integrity as early as possible.
