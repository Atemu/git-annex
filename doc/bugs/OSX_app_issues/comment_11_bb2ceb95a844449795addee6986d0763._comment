When I run via the App and set up a fresh repo, i get some Console.app spam (looks like one per file added to the repo dir... or maybe one per git command?):

and nothing seems to work. The page address and the pid increment steadily with each line.  I'm using 10.8.2 (12C60) on a Mac Pro, and grabbed:

     /git-annex/OSX/current/10.8.2_Mountain_Lion/git-annex.dmg.bz2

It seems to be a code signing issue, perhaps with the vendored git binaries. While things are sort-of working, the web app shows the files flying by really fast. 

Using a fresh repo via `git annex webapp` works great (I built that after much teeth-knashing, brew install/link cycles, and then cabal install git-annex). 

I am very excited for this to work, this is exactly what I've been waiting for to replace dropbox. Came very close to writing it myself a few times (and in Haskell no less!!).
