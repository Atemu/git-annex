git-annex fsck only displays that warning when annex.securehashesonly=true.
That is not a default setting.

Seems to me, setting that when your repo legitimately uses insecure
hashes will cause other problems, eg git-annex will refuse to transfer
content using insecure hashes since it cannot verify it.
So, you could just unset that.

I suppose, if you've migrated away from those hashes, but still have old
objects using them present in the annex, and turned on
annex.securehashesonly=true, fsck --all will warn about the objects.
If that's the problem, it might make sense to disable the warning for
--all and --key.
