Seems this does not have to do with special characters at all.

Instead, it's a problem with too-long filenames; windows has a crazy short
limit. All explained here:
(http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__34__git-annex:_direct:_1_failed__34___on_Windows)

You could just switch from the WORM backend to one with shorter filenames.
SHA1 might be a god choice.

Or, install git-annex 5.20150113, which includes some changes to use shorter
relative paths to files, and may avoid the problem at least some of the
time. That version also avoids making such long WORM keys.
