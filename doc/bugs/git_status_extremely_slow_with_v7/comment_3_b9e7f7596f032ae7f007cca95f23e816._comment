This bug needs to have instructions for how to reproduce a problem in order
for me to do anything about it.  As it is, I can only guess.

[[git_keeps_refreshing_index]] was another report likely the same problem.
There I diagnosed and fixed a case that would cause this behavior. I do not
know if it is the case that you are reporting here, or a different one.
I guess probably the same one. So if there's no followup, I'll probably
close this bug report..
