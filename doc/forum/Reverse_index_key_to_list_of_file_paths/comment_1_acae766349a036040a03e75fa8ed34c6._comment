> How would I make sure that potential moves/renames will update the index?

If I had a good answer to that question I would have built it already.

I mean, a post-commit hook can notice changed after the fact, but noticing
them when they've just been staged is harder.

It does not make sense to store such an index in the git-annex branch,
because it's redundant information to what's already stored in git trees.

This is discussed in [[todo/cache_key_info]].
