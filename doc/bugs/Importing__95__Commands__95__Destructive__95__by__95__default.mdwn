### Please describe the problem.
the import and reinject commands are needlessly destructive by default.
this caused me some grief as it repeatedly "destroyed" data on my cammeras sdcard
as i tried to import new data nad/or reinject missing data correctly
without having to scan 40gb of pictures for hases repeatedly.

### what i would like to see

* better documentation for commands that sort out non-destructive importing
  (@joeyh already pointed out `cp` followed by `git annex add` on irc, but that doesn't cover known files/keys)
* comprehensible options that disable deletion for `reinject`/`import`, i consider the semantics of "move" for commands with actionable names like "import" and "reinject" a bit deceptive even if they are documented that way


for me personally the ideal case would be a cp command for git annex that would copy in new data
in a cp style allowing to use options like `noclobber` and perhaps `reinject`

it may be sensible to leave supporting this to the importtree feature
