AnnexRead has recently been split out of AnnexState,
and reading values from it is faster (no MVar). So,
anything that never needs to be modified while git-annex is running can be
moved to AnnexRead for a performance win and also to make clean how it's
used. --[[Joey]]

The easy things have been moved now, but some things like Annex.force and
Annex.fast would be good to move. Moving those would involve running
argument processing outside the Annex monad. The main reason argument
processing runs in the Annex monad is to set those values, but there may be
other reasons too, so this will be a large set of changes that need to all
happen together. --[[Joey]]
