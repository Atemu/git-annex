### Please describe the problem.
The assistant keeps making merges that deletes all the files in the repository. I "git revert" the merge commit, but the next day it does it again. It also seems to have gone into a merge loop before this happens (will post a screenshot of tig). I can make the repo available privately if that will help.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Unknown. It does it on its own without me even interacting with files in the annex.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
The host that keeps deleting is running 6.20160428-g1f253e8 on ArchLinux (x86_64). A remote that it keeps syncing with is running 6.20160511-g4633f0b, also on ArchLinux x86_64.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
I use git-annex for everything. I've got 10 repositories and around 2.5TB of data in those repos which in turn is synced all over the place. It's excellent.
