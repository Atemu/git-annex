since a bit of time i have a strange probleme.
My git annex environement look like this :

A      E  
|\    /  
| C--D  
|/    \  
B      F.....G  

the dot point because G is an external drive and can be plug anywhere else.
let's say my last comit is **db1a9a**
If i add some file on the repo from G and sync point to point like :
i'm in G : 
git annex sync F
a new commit is created say **61dacd**
go F
git annex sync D
go D
git annex sync E ...etc

at some point my commit 61dacd becomme the parent of a new commit i dono the source ... let's say **4fcdae**

in git log i found 

commit **4fcdae**... (HEAD -> master, B/synced/ma
ster, B/master, C/synced/master, C/master, synced/master)

and that commit just undo all the change done by the previous one, indeed : 

git diff **4fcdae** **db1a9a**
-> nothing

this... force me to play with branch like every time and anoyed me alot. I don't understand what's happening here.
Does any one have any clue/insight on what i can do to fix this/investigate ?

All repo are at the commit db1a9a before i start...

best regards
