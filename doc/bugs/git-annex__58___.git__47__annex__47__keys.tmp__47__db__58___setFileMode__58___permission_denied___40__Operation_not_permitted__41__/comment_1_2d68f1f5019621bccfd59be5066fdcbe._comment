I remeber that git message, it's trying to remove the world read bit
from .git/config and the hack that is /sdcard does not support that.

On my phone (Android 8.1), neither git nor git-annex has the problem.
/sdcard still doesn't really support unix file permissions, but chmod on 
it no longer fails, just silently leaves wrong permissions.

Given that there are plenty of places in git-annex that set file modes,
I'd rather not complicate it by ignoring a failure to do so.
It would not be a problem to fix this one specific case of it, which
is in Database/Init.hs's callto setFileMode, but I don't know if fixing
that won't just expose lots of other problems.
