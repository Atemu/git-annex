--debug might provide some clue in its http dump.

The ParseError comes from attoparsec. Seems likely that aeson/aws is what's
using it there, and that it is failing to parse something from S3.

Of course, the malloc error suggests a low-level memory problem, probably
from C code. I don't think git-annex contains anything like that, so it
must be from a dependency.

The S3 signature being wrong again points to the aws library, or something
lower level. And then the following double free is another low-level memory
problem.

So there's a pattern, and it seems to extend across linux and OSX.

Kind of wondering if something in the library stack is somehow failing to
be concurrency safe. If two http requests end up using the same memory,
it would kind of explain all of this.
