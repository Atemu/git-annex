### Please describe the problem.
Some internals of git annex does not check if the shell it is running is Posix-compatible, ie. bash.

I am using fish, and after setting up local pairing, and working, I switched back the login-shell to fish, and when syncing a file, I got this error, read from daemon.log:

fish: Unknown command 'GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_DIRECTORY=/home/s/annex'. Did you mean to run ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell with a modified environment? Try 'env GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_DIRECTORY=/home/s/annex ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell...'. See the help section on the set command by typing 'help set'.
Standard input: GIT_ANNEX_SHELL_DIRECTORY='/home/s/annex' ~/.ssh/git-annex-shell
                ^
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Set up local pairing ( I believe having sh/bash as login terminal is necessary for this).
Switch back to fish as login-shell with chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
Add a file to either repository.
