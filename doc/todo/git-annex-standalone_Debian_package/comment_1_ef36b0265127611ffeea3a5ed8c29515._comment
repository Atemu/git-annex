I think this will work. I don't see a way to do it other than as a patch
to debian/ though.. Unless perhaps you could pass flags to stuff to make
a different directory be used. If you could do that, it could be included
in git-annex's master.

The package needs to depend on git (any version) so that the user can run
"git annex".

The rest of the depends are not necessary though. The standalone tarball
includes its own wget, rsync, gpg, curl, and ssh, so git-annex will be able
to use those.

If removing eg, the depends on wget though, you will want to add a
recommends on ca-certificates..
