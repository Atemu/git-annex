This must be more stuff on the OSX build machine that is using processor-specific optimisations. Similar to previously fixed problems with wget etc being built with those optimisations.

This time, it must be one of the several libraries git-annex links with, and only one that is used when using XMPP. So, one of libxml2, libidn, libgsasl, libgnutls.

I have replaced all of those libraries with unoptimised ones built with `brew install --build-bottle`. This is available in the daily built app now. Since I cannot test it myself, please download that <https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/x86_64-apple-mavericks/git-annex.dmg>  and let me know how it goes.
