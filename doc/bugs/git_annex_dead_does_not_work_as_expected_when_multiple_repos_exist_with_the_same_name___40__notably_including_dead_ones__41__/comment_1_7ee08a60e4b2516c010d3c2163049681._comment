I don't think it's a good idea to give multiple repos the same description.

You can use the uuid to refer to a repo unambiguously in this situation. 

I think it would add unncessary complication to make git-annex guess which repository you mean based on context
(ie, choosing repositories that are not already dead). This would make commands that are currently idempotent not be.

Perhaps git-annex should abort when multiple repositories match the given description? (Relevant code is Remote.nameToUUID's bydescription)
