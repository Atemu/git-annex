Relatedly, my team is struggling to identify the process for \"add and share a file\" - e.g., add the hash to git, and copy the content to a central git-annex remote, and push the git-annex branch information that the file is now in the central remote.

We used 'git annex sync' and 'git annex sync --content' for a while, but this creates the synced/ branches which introduced confusion; and it's unclear why both --content and with args are needed; and if I remember, it also committed or pushed changes we didn't want it to.

Now we do like this:

     git checkout features/your-new-branch
     git annex add my-new-file
     git commit -m \".....\"
     git push # pushes your \"features\" branch
     git annex copy --to SharedRemote --jobs=5 <files or folders>
     git fetch origin git-annex:refs/remotes/origin/git-annex
     git annex merge
     git push origin git-annex

I've read through <https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/> , <https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/sync_--branches__to_sync_only_specified_branches___40__e.g._git-annex__41__/> , <https://git-annex.branchable.com/sync/>

Maybe the OP has the same confusion, that there seems to be a missing git-annex-sync that does only (a) copy to a remote and (b) the git-annex branch work - Anyone able to help out direct us to how it's intended to be done?
