The automatic conflict resolution currently seems to only work within
the context of sync, when merging «synced/foo» into «foo». It would be
convenient if this functionality were exposed for manual merges
between local branches.

E.g., one might invoke «git annex merge» or «git annex autoresolve»
after «git merge» when conflicts are found.
