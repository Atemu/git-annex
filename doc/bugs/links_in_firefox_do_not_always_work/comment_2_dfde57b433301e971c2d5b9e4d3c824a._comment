Tried renaming / to /dashboard , just in case firefox was having problems with the name of the page. Didn't help, so the problem must be something on the page.

Tried removing the repolist and the transferlist from the dashboard, and this indeed avoided the problem. So it's certainly related to the long polling code. Although note that this left 1 long polling call still on the page, for the sidebar. In fact, only removing one of the repolist or transfer list seems to be enough to avoid the problem. 1 works, 2 works, 3 fails.

Aha.. After 3 long polling failures, the JS runs a fail function. To work around a seeming bug in chromium when navigating back to a page, [[!commit b5678d74a29023cbeb3d65c0d7f57d20f47ebef9]] made this reload the page.
