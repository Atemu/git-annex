I have finally managed to get ghc to build with the newest version of the NDK. I hope this means it will make binaries that work with 4.3, but I don't have a device to test.

Here is a hello world program built with it:
<http://tmp.kitenet.net/hello>

After downloading it to an Android device, you can test it by opening the
git-annex terminal, and running: `D=/data/data/ga.androidterm/tmp; cp hello $D; chmod +x $D/hello; $D/hello`

Tested working on android 4.0.4

Also, I have filed a bug upstream about this at <https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android/issues/23>
