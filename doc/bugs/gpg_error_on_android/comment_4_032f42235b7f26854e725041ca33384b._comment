So, I am able to get the \"bad\" key message out of gpg if I encrypt with --symmetric with a passphrase and then enter the wrong passphrase when decrypting.

Perhaps git-annex is sending gpg the wrong encryption key, or perhaps the git repo it's operating in has an old version of the key for this remote somehow?
