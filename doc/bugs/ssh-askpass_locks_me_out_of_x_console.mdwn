### Please describe the problem.

Can't access X console after returning to work overnight.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Create git-annex remote repository, with git annex assistance, connected via ssh, using ssh-agent key for authentication.
2. "ssh-add -D" to delete the ssh key when not attending computer. Forget to kill git-annex assistant.
3. Lock screen with xscreeensaver.
4. Return to work. Unlock screen. Find keyboard and mouse not responding. However there are no dialog boxes on screen.
5. Open up text console, kill the numerous ssh-askpass processes. Find more ssh-askpass processes. Kill the git-annex processes, then kill the ssh-askpass processes. Find I can access the x console again.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version 5.20140320~bpo70+1 in Debian backports.

### Please provide any additional information below.

This isn't git-annex's fault, but it is a serious problem with using git-annex assistant.

Suspect ssh-askpass isn't displaying dialog properly as it conflicts with xscreensaver, which is running at the time.

Not really sure what the solution is.

Unfortunately, Out of time for today, will double check this report makes sense tomorrow.
