It's a C library and it's not vendored into the haskell library as is often
the case, so it has be be linked in. I don't know what would be involved in
getting it installed on windows and bundled with git-annex in a usable state,
and I'm a bit afraid to find out.

WSL can be used to run linux git-annex on windows, so that's a way already
available to use MagicMime.

(The entire future of the windows port is currently TBD, it seems likely
that it will go away and WSL be used, aside from the current bugs in WSL
that make sqlite crash.)
