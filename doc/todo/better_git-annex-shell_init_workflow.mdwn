Currently, the workflow for initializing a remote repo has to involve
manually pushing the git-annex branch to the repo, first. This primes
git-annex-shell to auto-initialize the repo. Only after that first push,
can git-annex sync be used. If git-annex sync is run earlier, it will try
to get the remore uuid, fail, and set annex-ignore.

This should be improved.. It ought to be possible to add a new remote and
have git-annex sync do everything needed.
