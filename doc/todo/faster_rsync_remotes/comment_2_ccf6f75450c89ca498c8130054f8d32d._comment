It seems like you can just put multiple source files on the command line:

    ed@ed-Ubu64 /tmp$ touch a b c d
    ed@ed-Ubu64 /tmp$ mkdir test
    ed@ed-Ubu64 /tmp$ rsync -avz a b c d test
    sending incremental file list
    a
    b
    c
    d
    
    sent 197 bytes  received 88 bytes  570.00 bytes/sec
    total size is 0  speedup is 0.00
    ed@ed-Ubu64 /tmp$ ls test
    a  b  c  d

It also appears to work with remote transfers too.
