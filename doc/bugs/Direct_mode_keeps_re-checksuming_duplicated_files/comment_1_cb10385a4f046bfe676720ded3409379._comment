It seems that, to fully fix this, direct mode will need to be changed to store multiple inode caches for each key.

Since the files have the same content, but different inodes and/or mtimes, at least one of them is going to appear changed to sync each time.

What currently happens is that the first is re-added, and so its inode cache gets stored, and then that means the second's inode cache no longer matches, and it's re-added, and its inode cache gets stored. Putting the inode cache right back in position to force re-adding the first again..

Storing multiple inode caches appears easy enough, but I have not yet worked out exactly how to clear out old inode caches.
