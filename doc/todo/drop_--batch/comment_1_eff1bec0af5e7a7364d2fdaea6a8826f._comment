Might be better to make `dropkey` do the same numcopies checking as
`drop` does. Currently, `dropkey` needs `--force` to do anything (and it's
always needed that), so it could do numcopies checking when not forced,
without breaking backwards compatability.

The benefit of keeping this in `dropkey` is that dropping by key
tends to work better with batch adds/imports of files that are occurring at
the same time.

Only downside I see is that dropping by key is unable to honor
.gitattributes numcopies settings, since the associated filename is not
known.
