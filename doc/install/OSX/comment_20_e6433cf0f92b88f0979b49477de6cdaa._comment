I'm getting an error when attempting to launch the webapp using the brew build of the app. The error is as follows:
```
uname: illegal option -- o
usage: uname [-amnprsv]
...
git-annex: user error (uname [\"-o\"] exited 1)
```
Is anyone else getting this error? I have tried the autobuilt dmg as well but that doesn't launch the webapp.

Thanks!
