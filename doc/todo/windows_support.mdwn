The git-annex Windows port is not ready for prime time. But it does exist
now! --[[Joey]] 

## status

* Does not work with Cygwin's build of git (that git does not consistently
  support use of DOS style paths, which git-annex uses on Windows). 
  Must use the upstream build of git for Windows.
* rsync special remotes are known buggy.
* Bad file locking, it's probably not safe to run more than one git-annex
  process at the same time on Windows.
* Ssh connection caching does not work on Windows, so `git annex get`
  has to connect twice to the remote system over ssh per file, which
  is much slower than on systems supporting connection caching.
* Webapp doesn't build yet. Well, it all builds, but link fails:
  "Unable to start C:\Program Files\Haskell
  Platform\2013.2.0.0\mingw\bin/realgcc.exe (error code: 87)"
  This is the same problem that occurs when trying to link it
  with WebDAV or XMPP enabled. 
  
  Filed a ghc bug: <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/8596>

  Tried to do a minimal build with only the assistant and webapp, but that
  also failed to link (was around 40k gcc command line).

  May need to separate out Common and Git into standalone libraries to
  work around this? Ugh.

* `git annex watch` works, but does not detect when files are still open
  for write as they're being added (no lsof)
* `git annex assistant` has not been tested, is probably quite incomplete.
  Is known to not download any files. (transferrer doesn't built yet)
