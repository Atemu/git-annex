designed to interoperate with it.

* The [[git-annex assistant|assistant]] is included in git-annex,
  and extends its use cases into new territory.
* [git-annex-watcher](https://github.com/rubiojr/git-annex-watcher)
  is a status icon for your desktop.
* [[forum/gadu_-_git-annex_disk_usage]] is a du like utility that
  is git-annex aware.
* [sizes](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sizes) is another du-like
  utility, with a `-A` switch that enables git-annex support.
* Emacs Org mode can auto-commit attached files to git-annex.
* [git annex darktable integration](https://github.com/xxv/darktable-git-annex)
* [Magit](http://github.com/magit/magit), an Emacs mode for Git, has
  [an extension](https://github.com/magit/magit-annex) for git annex.
