### Please describe the problem.
If a repository path contains a space, git-annex can't copy to it

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Create a new remote in a directory with a space in the path: `git annex initremote encryptedbackup type=gcrypt gitrepo='/run/media/volume name with a space/repo' keyid=$mykey`
2. Try to copy data: `git annex copy --to=encryptedbackup file.mkv`

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log

$ git annex copy --to=encryptedbackup file.mkv
copy file.mkv (unable to check encryptedbackup) failed

# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
