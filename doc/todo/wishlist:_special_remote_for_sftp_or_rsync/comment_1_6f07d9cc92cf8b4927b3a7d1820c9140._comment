+1 for a generic user configurable backend that a user can put shell commands in, which has a disclaimer such that if a user hangs themselves with misconfiguration then its their own fault :P

I would love to be able to quickly plugin an irods/sector set of put/get/delete/stat(get info) commands into git-annex to access my private clouds which aren't s3 compatible.
