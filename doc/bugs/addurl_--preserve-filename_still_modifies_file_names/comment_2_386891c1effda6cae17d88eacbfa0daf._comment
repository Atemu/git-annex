Thanks for the fast fix. I've run it with my test torrent and the files now all have their original names.


As for the the directory name, there's the component that git-annex picks, and the one in the torrent.

As git-annex has historically ignored the latter, so be it -- we could think up a configurable option, but I wouldn't bother. (And it wouldn't necessarily be a change in the remote protocol, the torrent remote could just prefix its paths with the `name` field if that gets configured.)

The component that git-annex picks I would kind of have expected to be absent: If I'm in a directory and tell git-annex to --preserve-filename get a copy of whatever, I'd expect the server-provided name (or names) of that thing to pop up in that directory, the command was issued, not in a subdirectory.
