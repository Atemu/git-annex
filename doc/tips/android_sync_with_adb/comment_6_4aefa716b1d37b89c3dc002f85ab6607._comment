This tip seems to work just fine when I try it. After `git annex sync
--content android`, it had merged the remotes/android/master branch
in. So I don't think there's a general problem with this tip that needs
to be discussed here.

The remote tracking branch is created or updated every time git-annex
imports from the android remote, eg every time that sync command is run.

If it's not creating it for you, you might have run into a bug, but if
so you'll need to work out how others can reproduce it, and file a bug
report.
