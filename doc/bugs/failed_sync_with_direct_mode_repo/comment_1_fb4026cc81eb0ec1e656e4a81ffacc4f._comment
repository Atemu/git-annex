Reproduced this as described.

Only happens when using the assistant in the second repository, which is a ssh remote of the first, and when there is not also a remote going the other way (so does not affect pairing).

As I thought, the problem is that the master branch is not updated by the assistant when in direct mode, and while annex/direct/master is pulled by the other assistant, it does not merge it.
