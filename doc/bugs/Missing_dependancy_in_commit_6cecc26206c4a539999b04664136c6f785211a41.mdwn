Seems commit 6cecc26206c4a539999b04664136c6f785211a41 missed on dependancy, that is blaze-markup

<pre>
Assistant/Threads/WebApp.hs:25:8:
    Could not find module `Text.Blaze.Renderer.String'
    It is a member of the hidden package `blaze-markup-0.5.1.0'.
    Perhaps you need to add `blaze-markup' to the build-depends in your .cabal file.
    Use -v to see a list of the files searched for.
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
git-annex-3.20120721 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1
</pre>

This should fix it
