Yes, a single chunk did get transferred correctly.

Actually, many times I've run this experiment, many chunks did get transferred correctly. I've even verified that they are in S3, but git-annex is trying to re-upload them. 

(I haven't checked their contents in S3 but the filenames are there and the sizes are there)
