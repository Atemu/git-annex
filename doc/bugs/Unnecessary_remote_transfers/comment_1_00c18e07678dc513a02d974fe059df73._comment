In what order does the webapp list your repositories? 

When a new file appears, it will always go through the list of repositories in order, and try to transfer the file to each in turn, unless the configuration indicates it shouldn't. So, if the remote transfer repo is listed before the local repo, it will first upload the file to the transfer repo, and then upload it to the local repo. (And then later on, remove it from the transfer repo, since the file has reached all clients, probably.) OTOH, if the local repo comes first, it will upload the file to it over the LAN, and then when it comes to the transfer repo, if the file has successfully been sent to all clients, the transfer repo will no longer want it, and so no expensive upload is done over the internet.

You can re-order the repository list in the webapp by dragging them up and down. It should default to having your locally paired repos first, unless you've changed it. If you think it came up with the wrong order, paste in your .git/config before you re-order the repositories..
