git-annex has always required the remote have git-annex-shell installed in order to store files on it. Nothing has changed in this area.

So, you seem to be very confused about something, but I cannot tell what from this bug report, and I certianly see no evidence of any bug  in the information provided so far. You need to install git-annex on your server and then it should work, assuming the server actually has a git-annex repository set up on it.
