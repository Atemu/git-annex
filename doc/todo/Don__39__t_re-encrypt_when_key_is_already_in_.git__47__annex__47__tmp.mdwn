I've implemented true resumable upload in git-annex-remote-googledrive which means that uploads can, just as downloads, be resumed at any point, even within one chunk. However, it currently does not work with encrypted files (or chunks) due to the non-deterministic nature of GPG. In order to make this feature useable on encrypted files, I propose to not overwrite encrypted files which are already present inside the `tmp` directory.
