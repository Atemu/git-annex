git-annex 3.20111122 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * merge: Improve commit messages to mention what was merged.
   * Avoid doing auto-merging in commands that don't need fully current
     information from the git-annex branch. In particular, git annex add
     no longer needs to auto-merge.
   * init: When run in an already initalized repository, and without
     a description specified, don't delete the old description.
   * Optimised union merging; now only runs git cat-file once, and runs
     in constant space.
   * status: Now displays trusted, untrusted, and semitrusted repositories
     separately.
   * status: Include all special remotes in the list of repositories.
   * status: Fix --json mode.
   * status: --fast is back
   * Fix support for insteadOf url remapping. Closes: #[644278](http://bugs.debian.org/644278)
   * When not run in a git repository, git-annex can still display a usage
     message, and "git annex version" even works.
   * migrate: Don't fall over a stale temp file.
   * Avoid excessive escaping for rsync special remotes that are not accessed
     over ssh.
   * find: Support --print0"""]]
