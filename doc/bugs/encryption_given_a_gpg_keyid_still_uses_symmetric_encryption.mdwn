    ok

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

> I expect any transfers to this remote (glacier) to use the given gpg key, but instead it uses --symmetric, as you can see above.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

    git-annex version: 3.20130107
    local repository version: 3
    default repository version: 3
    supported repository versions: 3
    upgrade supported from repository versions: 0 1 2
