This seems like something the git developers might consider a bug in git
worktree, since generally git doesn't care if .git is a symlink or a
pointer file. 

Although perhaps the reason it checks is to avoid deleting something it
didn't set up.

I don't see any way to improve this in git-annex though, if .git is not a
symlink then every git-annex symlink in the repository will need to change
to point to the real path to .git/annex/objects, which is not practical.
