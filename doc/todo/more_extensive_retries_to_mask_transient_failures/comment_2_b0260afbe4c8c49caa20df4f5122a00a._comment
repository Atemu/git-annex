I don't think that git-annex can generally abort an operation that is
outright hung. While it's certianly possible to kill a worker thread, if
that thread has other threads associated with it, they could keep on using
resources. And if an external command is hung, the command would keep
running. The only way to guarantee such an abort is to kill the whole
git-annex process and let the signal reap its children. That's what the
assistant does when the UI is used to stop a transfer, it kills the whole
`git-annex transferkeys` process.

(A locked git index file does not prevent git-annex from making transfers
so AFAICS the comment above is not relevant.)
