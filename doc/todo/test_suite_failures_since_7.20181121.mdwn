Since 7.20181121 Debian has been seeing test suite failures, on the mips autobuilders and on the amd64 CI infrastructure, but not on the amd64 autobuilders.

With 7.20181205 I was not able to reproduce the mips failure on a porterbox.  Instead, a bunch of different tests failed.  I have not yet had time to try 7.20181121 on a porterbox.

However, the most recent failures on the CI infrastructure and the mips autobuilders looks to be the same set of tests that have failed.  So I am inclined to think that the problem is not a flaky test.

I won't have time to investigate for a few days but I thought that I would at least get this bug filed.
