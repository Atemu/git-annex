### Please describe the problem.

I tried to create an annex (``git annex init foo``) inside a ``encfs`` mount, and git-annex says that it's crippled, and disables core.symlinks and goes into direct mode

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

    apt-get install encfs
    encfs -o kernel_cache empty_dir other_empty_dir
    cd other_empty_dir
    git init
    git annex init foo

### Expected results

    init foo ok
    (Recording state in git...)

### Actual results

    init foo 
      Detected a crippled filesystem.

      Disabling core.symlinks.

      Enabling direct mode.
    ok
    (Recording state in git...)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20130601 on debian unstable


### P.S.

This was particularly annoying when I tried this on a bare repository. I'm pretty sure bare repositories don't need symlinks, and should definitely not be in direct mode. Hopefully you can fix it before I have time to file another bug report :)

Thank you!
