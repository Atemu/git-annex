The release of git-annex with all the ByteString optimisations went out
earlier this week. The Windows autobuilder was down and I didn't try to get
it building on Windows, so fixed that today, luckily all those changes only
broke a few bits of Windows-specific code.

Also today, I added git-annex add --force-annex/--force-git options.
These do the same thing as -c annex.largefiles=anthing etc, but 
are easier to type and may avoid some tricky git behavior in some edge
cases.

I'd kind of like to get back to v8 this month and perhaps release it.
There's a `v8` branch now, which as well as the sqlite changes adds a new
annex.dotfiles config setting, and cleans up the special cases around
adding dotfiles. Anyone not using git-annex to manage large dotfiles
(or files in dotdirs) won't be impacted, but those who do will need to
enable annex.dotfiles and configure annex.largefiles to match the dotfiles
they want annexed. There is a risk that someone who's in the habit of
running `git annex add .dotfile` to add them to the annex will be surprised
when the new version adds them to git because they've not done the necessary
configuration. I'm still mulling over whether this is an acceptable risk
to mostly de-uglify and de-special-case dotfiles.
