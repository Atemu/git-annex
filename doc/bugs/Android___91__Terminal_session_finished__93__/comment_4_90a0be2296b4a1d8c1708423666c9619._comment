Ok, so the git-annex.apk ships several libraries (and pseudo-libraries), and it seems your version of Android only installed the one that is really an Android java application. I don't know why.

Here's the full list of files that are supposed to be installed in the lib dir. If you can find something about them in the logs, that might help.

I suppose it's possible they were installed to some other location in the android file system (which might be hard to find w/o root.. You could check if git-annex in the app list has a larger installed size than the size of libga-androidterm4.so, that might give a hint.

<pre>
lib.busybox.so
lib.git-annex.so
lib.git-shell.so
lib.git-upload-pack.so
lib.git.so
lib.git.tar.gz.so
lib.gpg.so
lib.rsync.so
lib.runshell.so
lib.ssh-keygen.so
lib.ssh.so
lib.start.so
lib.version.so
libga-androidterm4.so
</pre>

(I just installed the 5.20140414-gb70cd37 autobuild on an android device and it worked ok.)
