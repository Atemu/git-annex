I don't understand this request at all

* There are plenty of console emulators with bidi support. If you need bidi support, surely you have already found and are using one of them?
* `git annex log` does not output much that seems likely to need bidi support. At least no more than any other git-annex command, specifically names of remotes, and names of files.
* `git annex log` is a low-level tool, almost a debugging tool. Users of the webapp might be interested in which repositories a file has gotten to, but surely not the history of past locations of files.
