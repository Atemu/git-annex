@joey: Hm.. I'm sure it was 'git annex sync' that initially consumed all RAM by spawning a lot of 'git status' processes. However, I can't replicate it anymore as I found a way to make the repository useable again.

I went low into the directory structure and added/committed from there. Now I can 'git annex sync' and 'git status' from the annex root without any problems.

Sorry for cluttering this bug report up, thought it might be related/of some help.
