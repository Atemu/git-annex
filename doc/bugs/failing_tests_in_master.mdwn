Recent optimisation work has caused some test suite failures, involving
unannex and fsck. --[[Joey]]

Hmm, the unannex one is because it doesn't check if a file is present
inAnnex anymore, so fails on unannexing a non-present file.

The check was removed in 
[[!commit 75aab72d23ebf8ef0d56d7dd74c121e33d64f1f6]], but that did have
withFilesInGitAnnex doing an inAnnex check and not running the command if
it failed. But later that got changed to only happen when
checkContentPresent is set.

Everything in that and related commits
needs to be re-examined to make sure no other inAnnex checks were lost.
