Does seem like a good idea.

Piping avoids needing to link git-annex with multiple compression
libraries, or picking the wrong compression libraries. 
I suppose that it's no big deal for a special remote to require that
everyone who uses it has xz or whatever installed.

But: The *name* of the command that is used cannot be stored in the remote
config in the git-annex branch because that would be insecure. A mapping in
the git-annex code from compression formats to known-safe command names
would be one way, or a git config setting that has to be manually set when
enabling the remote. Or both.
