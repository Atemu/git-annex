OK, so I might have a rogue transferkey process going on, but one which starts over again when I restart the app?

I've set this all up purely as a \"can I do this\" experiment right now; there is literally zero important data there to lose, either on the tablet or on the laptop, so maybe I could just write this off as a bad result of my first few shaky attempts to get the device paired with my laptop, wipe out both annexes, and start completely from scratch.
