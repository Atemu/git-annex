git grep doesn't use an index per se, but is probably faster
than `find` at least sometimes. And probably somewhat faster than things
involving `git-annex find` too.

It's unfortunate that `git grep` doesn't search on the content of symlink
texts, so that can't be used to find locked files.

The equivilant using git-annex find, which will find both types:

	git annex find --format '${key}\n' | grep SHA256E-s320029--488e29f5584ba4e474db95aa42fbb58ddb92f2a59bc0b24a91171acb4d8f4828.png
