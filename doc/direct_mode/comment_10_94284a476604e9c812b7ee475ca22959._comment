Re-reading @joey's reponse above, I see that merge/pull don't seem to be safe and will create dangling symlinks. That corresponds to those files I can see on cifs, I guess.

But then, how can a direct repo sync with changes made in other remotes, if there no pull/fetch available.

Can it then be only the source of changes which will propagate to indirect remotes ?
