This sounds like it could be built around my own suggestion of [[todo/Bidirectional_metadata]].

There, Joey mentions that the datalad project uses a special remote. Perhaps one could be made where it does the JPG/NEF mapping and reports the JPG as available if the NEF is, allowing the NEF to count as a copy.

I wouldn't personally do this unless the JPG can be reliably reproduced from the NEF *exactly* though!
