Afaik, the enclosure url is supposed to point to the actual file
to download. So this feed is broken.

`git annex importfeed` has specific support for rss feeds
that link to youtube (or other quvi supported) pages. The way
such a feed should work, or at least the way that youtube's rss
feeds worked before they fell victim to the 5-year-old-feature-so-it-dies
google bitrot, is that an xml link element is used to point to the page.
