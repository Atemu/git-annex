Yeah, that command you say you ran makes no sense.

Now, running that command *does* upgrade the repo, if
upgrading has not already been disabled in the git config.
Because git-annex auto-upgrades on the first command run,
and the fact that the command just errors out due to being
used incorrectly doesn't prevent that from happening.

But I get the feeling that command is not what you actually did?

You can run `git config --global annex.autoupgraderepository false`
and you only have to set it that one time for that machine and it will
avoid all upgrades.
