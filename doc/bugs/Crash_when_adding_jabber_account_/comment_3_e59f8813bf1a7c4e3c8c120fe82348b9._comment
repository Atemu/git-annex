I tried to reproduce this with the standalone i386 tarball for 4.20130314. Was able to add a jabber account using my google talk account with no crash.

Given the age of this bug report, I'm just going to close it. But if you still see it with the current verison, please let me know! (And I guess you'd have to tell me which jabber server you're using then..)
