I am getting the same error messages as **olaf**. It does not seem to be related to brew vs dmg **jhnichol**.

Using the web-gui I can create one local repo. When I try to create a second local repo, by clicking `Add another repository` | `Add another repository` | `Make Repository` | `Combine the repositories` the webapp then fails with this error message:

    Internal Server Error
    there is no available git remote named \"a2\"
    git-annex version 6.20180409-gfb0780266

Looking at the .git/config files for the repos, the names seem strange/incorrect. The second repo has the remote name listed as my hostname, “bumblebee.local”? Not sure if this is an issue.

Also from a git remote perspective I am a bit confused what I just did? Did I create two completely separate git repos then try to combine them, what does that mean? Shouldn't I have cloned the first repo instead of creating a new one?

When I created two repos on the commandline I didn't run into any issues, but, what I did was create a repo, then clone it into another directory, then added the new repo as a remote of the 1st repo. It seems the combine button in the webapp isn't doing that. Perhaps combine should only be enabled for special remotes, is that the problem?

========== full log below, first steps to make the error with webapp, followed by success on the commandline =============
<pre>
git-annex webapp

make repository:
/Users/Shared/a1

add a file:
image1.png

assistant detects and adds to git-annex

click add another repository
/Users/Shared/a2

assistant creates the directory
runs git init and git-annex init

click:
Combine repositories?
The repository at /Users/Shared/a2 is set up. 
Do you want to combine it with your existing repository at /Users/Shared/a1?

 The combined repositories will sync and share their files.
 

Internal Server Error
there is no available git remote named \"a2\"
git-annex version 6.20180409-gfb0780266

At this point /Users/Shared/a2/.git/config has 
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = true
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true

	direct = true
[gc]
	auto = 0
[remote \"bumblebee.local\"]
	url = ../a1
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/bumblebee.local/*
		
And /Users/Shared/a1/.git/config has 
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = true
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true

[remote \"a2\"]
	url = /Users/Shared/a2
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/a2/*
	

Perhaps 







OK.


Now do this from the commandline:

andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared$ mkdir a1
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared$ cd a1
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/Shared/a1/.git/
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git annex init
init  ok
(recording state in git...)

andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git annex describe here a1
describe here ok
(recording state in git...)

andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git annex direct
commit 
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit
ok
direct ok
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ cp ~/Desktop/Screen\ Shot\ 2018-05-04\ at\ 10.10.55\ AM.png image1.png
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git add image1.png 
fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ ls
image1.png
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git annex add image1.png 
add image1.png ok
(recording state in git...)
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ 

add /Users/Shared/a1 to ~/.config/git-annex/autostart

then:

andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git-annex assistant --autostart 
git-annex autostart in /Users/Shared/a1
ok
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ 

launch webapp, see that a1 is listed, add a file, see that webapp detects it

Clone repo1 to another directory
andrew@bumblebee ~/.config/git-annex$ cd
andrew@bumblebee ~$ cd /Users/Shared/
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared$ git clone a1 a2
Cloning into 'a2'...
done.
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared$ cd a2
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a2$ git annex init \"a2\"
init a2 (merging origin/git-annex into git-annex...)
(recording state in git...)
ok
(recording state in git...)
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a2$ 

Add a2 as a remote from a1
andrew@bumblebee /Users/Shared/a1$ git remote add a2 /Users/Shared/a2

Add a2 to autostart file

Now repos are syncing

Both repos are listed in web-gui when I choose a2 as the repo, only one repo is listed in the web-gui when I choose a1 as the repo.
