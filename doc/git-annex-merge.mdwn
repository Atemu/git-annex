# NAME

git-annex merge - automatically merge changes from remotes

# SYNOPSIS

git annex merge

# DESCRIPTION

This performs the same merging (and merge conflict resolution)
that is done by the sync command, but without pushing or pulling any
data.

One way to use this is to put `git annex merge` into a repository's
post-receive hook. Then any syncs to the repository will update its
working copy automatically.
