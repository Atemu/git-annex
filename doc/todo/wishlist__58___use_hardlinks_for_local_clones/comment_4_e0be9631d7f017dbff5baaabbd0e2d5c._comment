No, please don't wrap your `cp`. Forcing git-annex to hard link
files like that can result in data loss, in a number of different
scenarios. And it's generally asking for a broken system.

Since version 5.20140915, you can "git clone --shared" and
this will set up a clone of a repository in which git-annex will
use hardlinks, in a safe and reliable way. (Notably it marks the clone
as untrusted.)
