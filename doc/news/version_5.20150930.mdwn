git-annex 5.20150930 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Added new linux standalone "ancient" build to support kernels
     like 2.6.32.
   * info: Don't allow use in a non-git-annex repository, since it
     uses the git-annex branch and would create it if it were missing.
   * assistant: When updating ~/.ssh/config, preserve any symlinks.
   * webapp: Remove the "disable remote" feature from the UI.
   * S3: When built with aws-0.13.0, supports using more storage classes.
     In particular, storageclass=STANDARD\_IA to use Amazon's
     new Infrequently Accessed storage, and storageclass=NEARLINE
     to use Google's NearLine storage.
   * Improve ~/.ssh/config modification code to not add trailing spaces
     to lines it cannot parse.
   * Fix a crash at direct mode merge time when .git/index doesn't exist
     yet. Triggered by eg, git-annex sync --no-commit in a fresh clone of
     a repository.
   * status: Show added but not yet committed files.
   * Added stack.yaml to support easy builds from source with stack."""]]
