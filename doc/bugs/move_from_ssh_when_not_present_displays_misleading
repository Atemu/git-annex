When a file is not present on a ssh remote, a move of that file fails
like this:

	move foo (from r...) 
	  verification of content failed
	  failed
	move bar (from r...) 
	  Lost connection (fd:24: hGetChar: illegal operation (handle is closed))
	  failed

Both files were not present, so two different failures, and neither message
bears on the real reason why the move failed.

(Despite the connection having closed, it then was able to move a third file
that was still present.)

IIRC there was a clear message displayed before git-annex-shell p2pstdio 
got implemented. --[[Joey]]
