Importing from special remotes necessarily needs to hold the list of files
in memory, or at least it seems like it would be hard to get it to stream
over them. So there may be some way to decrease the memory use per file
(currently 4.2 kb per file according to your numbers), possibly by around
50%, but it would still scale with the number of files. The whole import
interface would need to change to use trees to avoid that.
It would be ok to file a bug report about this.

The legacy directory import interface avoids such problems.
