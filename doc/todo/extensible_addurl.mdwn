`git annex addurl` supports regular urls, as well as detecting videos that
quvi can download. We'd like to extend this to support extensible uri
handling. 

Use cases range from torrent download support, to pulling data
from scientific data repositories that use their own APIs.

The basic idea is to have external special remotes (or perhaps built-in
ones in some cases), which addurl can use to download an object, referred
to by some uri-like thing. The uri starts with "$downloader:" to indicate
that it's not a regular url and so is not handled by the web special
remote.

	git annex addurl torrent:$foo
	git annex addurl CERN:$bar

Problem: This requires mapping from the name of the downloader, which is
probably the same as the git-annex-remote-$downloader program implementing
the special remote protocol (but not always), to the UUID of a remote.
That's assuming we want location tracking to be able to know that a file is
both available from CERN and from a torrent, for example.

Solution: Add a new method to remotes:

	claimUrl :: Maybe (URLString -> IO Bool)

Remotes that implement this method (including special remotes) will
be queried when such an uri is added, to see which claims it. Once the
remote is known, addurl will record that the Key is present on that remote,
and record the uri in the url log. 

Then retrieval of the Key works more or less as usual. The only
difference being that remotes that support this interface can look
at the url log to find the one with the right "$downloader:" prefix,
and so know where to download from. (Much as the web special remote already
does.)

Prerequisite: Expand the external special remote interface to support
accessing the url log. (done)

----

It would also be nice to be able to easily configure a regexp that normal
urls, if they match, are made to use a particular downloader. So, for
torrents, this would make matching urls have torrent: prefixed to them.

	git config annex.downloader.torrent.regexp '(^magnet:|\.torrent$)'

It might also be useful to allow bypassing the complexity of the external
special remote interface, and let a downloader be specified simply by:

	git config annex.downloader.torrent.command 'aria2c %url $file'

This could be implemented in either the web special remote or even in an
external special remote.
