Related: [[bugs/dotfiles_handled_differently]]

For most files, whether they get annexed is controlled by `annex.largefiles`. But dotfiles are configured to never be annexed regardless of `annex.largefiles`. This special-casing (in `.git/info/attributes`) is unexpected and confusing.  It is probably a consequence of making `git add` annex files by default, but it's better to change that default than to have the special case.  Also, `git-annex-add` seems to ignore the dotfiles, as in the bug report above.

I thought of reverting to an earlier version of git-annex until these and other issues can get worked out, but realized I can't, since the repos got irreversibly auto-upgraded to v7...
