Candyangel, thanks, failing is indeed the better thing to do
than copying when it's not safe to move. That makes sense.

Also, `git annex move` should honor required contents, and refuse to move
content away from a repository that requires it.

It would be ok to use --force instead of --unsafe, but it doesn't allow for
a staged transition from --unsafe by default to --safe by default. But, if
we decide a stanged transition is not needed, I would be inclined to use
the --force.

Move failing in these situations seems less likely to badly break existing
workflows than move leaving both copies would; the caller will see
that git-annex errored, rather than it silently leaving extra copies.
So perhaps a staged transition could be skipped.
