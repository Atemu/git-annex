Ok, I've made a note that I should look into pulling in gpgtools rather than gpg into the DMG. At least if the webapp every gets a UI that allows setting up remotes that are encrypted to a gpg key. Currently the webapp avoids that because I know gpg password prompting is not sorted out everywhere.

And also, I've made the configure script check for gpg2 if it can't find a gpg.
