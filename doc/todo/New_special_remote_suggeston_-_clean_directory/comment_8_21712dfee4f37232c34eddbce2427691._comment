1. I would propose the name \"plain directory\" for this special remote.  Clean is not a good description, IMHO.

2. When I read this a week ago I took the opportunity to play with the special remote hook, because as far as I can understand this could be a relatively trivial implementation that need not necessarily be in git-annex \"core\".   And I'd like to contribute back to the git-annex community and help a brother out...     I used the method of calling a single script from all hook points, and inside it look at what operation was requested.
I didn't get that far before giving up however.  I got the feeling that hook would benefit from some extension and a bit more complete API to really create the opportunity for third-party extensions to git-annex this way.   I would prefer that the hook script can handle several instances of remotes without creating custom hook scripts for each instance.  Specifically I think a hook is needed also for \"init\" of a new remote (to get a unique identifier, and other parameters given by the user such as in this particular case, the path to the \"clean directory\")   What do you think?
