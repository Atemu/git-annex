So I can do `git annex config --set annex.tune.objecthashlower true` to use the new hash format.
I don't see why it couldn't become the default since it can be done even on existing repositories. It is just that already stored files will not be directly recoverable since the path expected will not be the same, but for newly created repositories I really don't see any problem.
