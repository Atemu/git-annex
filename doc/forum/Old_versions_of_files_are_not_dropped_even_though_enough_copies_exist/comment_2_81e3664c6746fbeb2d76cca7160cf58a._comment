Thanks for the comment. I somehow forgot to mention that in my post, that `unused` does virtually nothing in this case.
If you stop my example after the first `tree` invocation and then in the `client` repository do `git annex unused` it tells you that there are no unused files. And hence neither `dropunused` or `drop --unused` does anything more.

So somehow I'm still stuck with this old version of the file which is duplicated and hence should be found and deletable, if I'm not mistaken.
