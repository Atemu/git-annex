There's not currently anything to automate this. I sometimes do it
manually, eg noticing that drive A is nearly full and `git-annex move --to
B` of some of its files to free up space. 

That's generally when I need space on drive A for some other purpose
than that git-annex repo. If drive A is only being used for the one
git-annex repo, then it doesn't much matter if it fills up before drive B?
So maybe setting annex.diskreserve to some sufficiently large size in that
repo on the drive would be better, so there's always space reserved for the
other things the drive is being used for.

[[design/balanced_preferred_content]] is an old attempt at designing
a way to automate balancing between drives. Never quite got implemented,
because of the limitations documented in it.
It might be that it would work well enough for some use cases?

I'd welcome thoughts on this topic.
