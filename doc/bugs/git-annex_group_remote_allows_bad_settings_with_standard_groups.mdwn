### Please describe the problem.

Running `git annex group here manual` and `git annex group here client` results in the nonsensical group of "manual client".  Should there be checking for the reserved "standard" group words?

The intention from the webapp and docs reads as though these groups should be mutually exclusive.

Also it would be nice if `git annex group here` returned the list of groups (I put this as a wishlist item but think it perhaps warrants a bug mention).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?


### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
