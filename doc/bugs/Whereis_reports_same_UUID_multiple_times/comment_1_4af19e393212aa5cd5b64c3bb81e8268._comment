This is quite odd. Normally, multiple instances of the same UUID can occur
but will get compacted down to 1.

That it only lists the remote name/description for one instance of the UUID
is probably a clue to whatever the problem is.

Can you paste the output of this command: `git show git-annex:uuid.log`

(It would be very helpful if I could get access to a clone of the git-annex
branch of your repository.)
