Rather than getting the timezone, another approach might be to look at the inode sentinal file. Its timestamp will also appear to have changed. If the delta is exactly some number of hours, and the inode sential's other data is unchanged, a Windows-specific hack could apply that same delta to all inode cache timestamps.

Except, time zones are not all actually on hour boundaries. Some are half hours, some may be 15 minutes, and next week some crazy country might legislate a 3 minute delta for all I know.

Well, could just say if the inode sentinal's mtime has changed at all (delta < 3600 seconds), and it's otherwise unchanged, and we're on windows, assume this is a time zone change. When would that fail? Only if the repository is copied to someplace, and the mtime is not preserved.
