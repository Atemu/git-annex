Filenames, in Unix, do not have a defined encoding. They are a sequence of
arbitrary bytes, excluding NUL.

So if a program assumes a filename is going to be utf-8 encoded and crashes
when it is not, that program is buggy. Especially if the program is a
git-annex external remote. You'll need to file a bug report on it, not
git-annex. 

Or alternatively, choose to re-encode all your filenames.
