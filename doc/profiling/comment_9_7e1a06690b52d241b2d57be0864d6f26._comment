Also, /usr/bin/time git-annex find:

The maxresident seems high, but a stack profile does not show a memory
leak, or such a large amount of memory use at all. Currently, I
think that memory is being preallocated by the ghc runtime,
or something like that. (See [[todo/memory_use_increase]].)

ghc 8.8.4  
Should keep an eye on this with newer ghc versions.
