I may have a bug along the same lines of this but I think it is in git, rather than git-annex.

I've been using git-annex to sort and consolidate ~2TB files that have been spread across several machines. I probably failed to do an important step (such as committing to git, I'm not sure) while moving a lot of these files around which renders me unable to use the repository.

For example, if I run any command that uses something like 'git status' in the background, it gradually consumes all available memory. I've not had an OOM error yet (8GB RAM, 2GB swap) but it also never seems to complete.

I just did a quick test on this and running 'git status' in the annex results in, after a few minutes, a growing number of 'git status --porcelain' processes (quickly reaches 70+, currently at 94) and nearly all memory consumed. This would normally be triggered with 'git annex sync' or some other command which uses 'git status' to do some work.

Hope this information is of some use. If I can help further, please let me know.
