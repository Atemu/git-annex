Doesn't the encryption part already write an encrypted version completely to disk before starting to upload? (At least with the rsync remote?) So the disk space and I/O usage is already there. (Except that it's probably a temporary file that's deleted after it was created, so that it's not kept around by the filesystem when certain destructive events strike.)
