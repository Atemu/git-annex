When a repo has annex.hardlink set, objects are hard-linked into the
repository when eg `git annex copy --from origin`. This should also
be done when copying files --to origin (or other remotes on the same
filesystem). This way, a quick shared clone can be used to add/modify
files, and cheaply send the changes back to the parent repo. --[[Joey]]
