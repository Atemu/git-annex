I’m running git-annex 5.20140517-gee56d21 on Android 4.3.

Running “git annex add filename” from the command line fails to execute sha256sum:

[[!format sh """
git-annex: sha256sum: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: does not exist (No such file or directory)
failed
git-annex: add: 1 failed
"""]]

“type sha256sum” says “sha256sum not found”, and indeed, /data/data/ga.androidterm/bin only contains the following files: busybox, git, git-annex, git-receive-pack, git-shell, git-upload-archive, git-upload-pack, gpg, rsync, ssh, ssh-keygen, trustedkeys.gpg.

Running “busybox sha256sum” does the right thing.

The assistant says “Added filename” every time it’s started but the file does not actually get added.

The only relevant log lines seem to be:

[[!format sh """
