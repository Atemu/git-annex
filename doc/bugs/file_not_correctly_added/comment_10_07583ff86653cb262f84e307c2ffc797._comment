So was myLargeFile.CR2 in fact an annex pointer file all along?

Anyway, I think it might be possible to avoid this confusing kind of
situation. If git-annex add sees an annex pointer file or symlink, it can
check if there's a location log file for it. Normally there always is. If
not, that's a situation where some file from another annex is being added,
and it can either warn, or refuse to proceed.

This will only really be worth doing if git-annex smudge --clean can also
do it, so if git add is used it does the same check.
