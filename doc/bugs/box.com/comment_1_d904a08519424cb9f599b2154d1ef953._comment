Ok, I managed to reproduce this. In my case, there was no \"Bad creds\" message because the broken creds data it used happened to contain a newline, but same problem; the creds stored by the webapp are not used properly when re-enabling the box.com remote elsewhere. Same problem would affect other special remotes using embedded creds and shared encryption.

Seems to be a bug introduced in [[!commit fbdeeeed5fa276d94be587c8916d725eddcaf546]]. Despite what the commit says, the embedded creds did get encrypted with the shared gpg key. I have reverted that commit to fix this problem.
