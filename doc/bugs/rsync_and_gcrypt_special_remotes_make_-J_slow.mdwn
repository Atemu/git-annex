When a rsync or gcrypt special remote is enabled, all git-annex commands
with -J become slow, even those that don't access the remote.

The problem is that Remote.Rsync.gen and Remote.Gcrypt.gen 
call rsyncTransport which calls sshOptions. 
When concurrency is enabled, that blocks for a ssh connection to be set up.
Even though the ssh connection will often not be used.

It should be possible for it not to block until the ssh connection is used.
