Unfortunately, the git error message you pasted suggests very strongly that your git repository has gotten corrupted. You can probably verify that by running `git annex fsck`. Assuming it is corrupted, the best thing to do is to make a new clone and move .git/annex and .git/config over from the corrupted repository to it, and finally run `git annex fsck`

You then seem to have some reason decided to go delete git-annex's .git/annex/journal/*.log files, which are just files that have not yet been committed to the git-annex branch. The only reason this \"restored some sanity\" is that git-annex was trying to commit that data to git, and failing because your git repository is corrupted.

(This has nothing at all to do with direct mode.)
