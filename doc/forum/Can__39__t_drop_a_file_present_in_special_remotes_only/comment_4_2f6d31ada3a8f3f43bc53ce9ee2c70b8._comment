I don't think there's much difference between your suggested `--no-lock`
and trusting the special remote, is there?

Anyway, there is the recently added annex.mincopies, which controls
how many copies git-annex requires to have locked for a drop to succeed.
Default is 1. I added that thinking some might want *more* locking
and so a higher value, but you could set it to a lower value which 
would behave the same as `--no-lock`.
