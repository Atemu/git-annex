Yes exactly, it spawns a dialog window and overall has a very nice interface for managing gpg keys. I switched from the DMG to cabal because I couldn't get the bundled gpg to ask for my password, setting up a gpg-agent seemed pretty complicated, so I just went for the packaged approach from https://gpgtools.org/.
