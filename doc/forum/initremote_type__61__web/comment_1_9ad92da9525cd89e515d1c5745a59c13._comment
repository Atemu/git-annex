The web special remote is not the thing you want to use for this.
That represents arbitrary files on any website, not a single git-annex
repository on one website.

Just add a git remote using the http protocol, pointing to a git
repository.

	git remote add http://my_server.net/path/to/repo/.git

See [[tips/setup_a_public_repository_on_a_web_site]] for several
configurations you will probably want to set on that repository to make it
work well over http.
