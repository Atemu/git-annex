Hey there, love git annex!

I have a (silly?) question: `git annex dropunused` tells me that there are not enough copies. I agree it is a good thing or at least might be in some cases.

The problem is this: I have synced and used `git annex copy --to` for all my repositories and still I have unused files that `dropunused` will not delete, since it finds no copies.

Am I doing something wrong here? Why are these (now) unused files not copied and therefore okay to delete locally?
