### Please describe the problem.
Can't add Amazon S3 repository hosted in Frankfurt

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Create Amazon S3 account, create a bucket hosted in Frankfurt and create an access key.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Ubuntu, git-annex via repositories. Aptitude says 5.20140717.

### Please provide any additional information below.
The git-annex assistant does not offer the selection of hosting in Frankfurt. If I enter "EU (Ireland)" instead, of course while also providing the other necessary details (access key id, secret access key, data center), the result is the following error:

[[!format sh """
The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method.
"""]]

I have not tried other hosting locations but I assume it has to do with the location which is not listed in the dropdown-list.
