You can run this script as root, and it will install it to /usr/local/bin, which should always be in your path:
<https://github.com/zerodogg/scriptbucket/blob/master/gitannex-install>

However, I'd hope most people do not need to use the standalone tarball to install git-annex on a server. Most major linux distributions have their own way to install git-annex by now, and while most of them are too old versions to use the git annex assistant with, those old versions work fine on a server. The assistant will interoperate with them just fine.
