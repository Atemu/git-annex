At the same time I was working on that patch set, there was another patch
being developed that affected the same filters (adding the long-running
filter interface to git). I think there may have also been some
uncertianty, on the part of the git developers, in taking the filter
interface in the direction I wanted to.

(Also honestly, I can only rebase large C patch sets some many times before my
time feels better spent doing something else. :-/)

On piping efficiency, `splice()` doesn't avoid the whole file needing to be
read in and and written to the pipe, which is the main bottleneck.
And the way the smudge/clean filters are used by git-annex 
(and git-lfs), bouncing the unaltered file content back out the other side
using `splice()` doesn't seem like it would be useful.
