### Please describe the problem.

In a debian unstable docker container, I run `git-annex assistant --auto` on a few repositories.

After a few days, I have many (> 10000 right now) zombie processes:

    % ps x | grep "git-annex.*defunct" | wc -l
    10325

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Keep `git-annex assistant` running.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Binary version 5.20151116-gbe86081 on Debian Linux unstable (up-to-date from a few days ago when my docker container started)

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

I couldn't live without git-annex to synchronize my documents over multiple hosts and archives :-)
