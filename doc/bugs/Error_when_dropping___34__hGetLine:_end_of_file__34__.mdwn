Running 3.20121112 on Debian Squeeze.

Since adding a certain directory of files (just a bunch of PDFs) yesterday I am getting errors when I try to use `git annex drop .` when the files aren't present, rather doing nothing or saying 'ok', as it used to do/should do.  The errors are of the form `git-annex: fd:10: hGetLine: end of file` and sometimes of the form `git-annex: fd:17: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe)`.  In my `daemon.log`, I have the errors

    (scanning...) Already up-to-date.
    Already up-to-date.
    TransferScanner crashed: fd:26: hGetLine: end of file
    Already up-to-date.

    git-annex: fd:24: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
    git-annex: fd:24: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe)

    git-annex: fd:24: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
    git-annex: fd:24: hFlush: resource vanished (Broken pipe)
    [many more repetitions]

If I `git annex get` the files and then drop them again, a further attempt at a drop gives all these errors again.
