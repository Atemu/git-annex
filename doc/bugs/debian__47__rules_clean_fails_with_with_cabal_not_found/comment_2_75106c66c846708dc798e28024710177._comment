Yeah, my patch is definitely incorrect.

Until now, I've been able to build a source-only package on a local machine which does not have ghc, cabal, or any haskell libraries installed.  The binary packages are then built in a PPA which includes backports of all the build-deps.  I'd like to avoid adding that PPA and all those dependencies to my local machine.

The top level command I'm using to build the source package is `gbp buildpackage --git-debian-branch=wily --git-sign-tags --git-tag -S -sa` and this adds `-d` when calling `dpkg-buildpackage` which does not check build dependencies and conflicts.

For now I've installed the dependencies and have my v6 builds!  Maybe `debian/cabal-wrapper` can detect the condition where cabal is not installed and the subcommand is \"clean\" and return success, since if cabal is not installed there won't be anything to clean.
