> maybe, git-annex could keep track of local unlocked files by inode, not just by path name?

That's an interesting idea. If it could be made to work well, I think it
would address my concerns from comment 2 while freeing `git add` to
otherwise behave however it might be desired to behave by the user.

I've expanded on the idea in 
[todo/inode_based_clean_filter_for_less_surprising_git_add]]

Thanks!
