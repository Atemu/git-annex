I've updated to the latest version as of 12 hours ago and I was able to create a USB repo on two computers.  4.20131105-g136b030 showing on the web app but 20131106 on the command line.

Is there an easy way of checking the repo is correctly encrypted?  I didn't see anything about encrypting (now the previous error has disappeared) when creating the repo - is this what I should expect?
