git-annex initremote creates a *new* special remote. 
(Back in version 4.20130501, initremote was also used
to enable an existing special remote so maybe you're remembering that, but
that was well before v5 anyway.)

So, when you clone your gitlab repo, which you have not pushed the
git-annex branch to, and then initremote shared-storage, you are making a
brand new remote, not enabling the one you created earlier. 
(If you had pushed the git-annex branch, the second initremote would
have complained that there was already a special remote by that name.) 

It's not possible that this brand new remote contains the content of
test.bin, at least as far as git-annex knows. Because it's brand new, and
so, presumably empty.

I'm not sure what specific thing in the older version of git-annex
might have made that appear to work. But it certianly seems that
what you're doing does not make any sense, and I would not have expected
it to work with any version of git-annex.

Nothing to do with v5 or v8 repository mode has anything to do with
this, certianly.
