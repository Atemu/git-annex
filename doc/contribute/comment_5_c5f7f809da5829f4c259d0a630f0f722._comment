Got it! In this case, since the [conversation](https://git-annex.branchable.com/todo/sync_--branches__to_sync_only_specified_branches___40__e.g._git-annex__41__/#comment-a232b074bb04a942903468cf0d7a13b1) has now moved on, I'll just complete my thought in reply to your most recent comment, but I'll use the workflow you suggested in the future if I need to edit a comment.
