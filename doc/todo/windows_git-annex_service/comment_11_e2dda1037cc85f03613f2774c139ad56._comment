I am stuck with apparently intractable permissions problems, if the git-annex service doesn't run as the same user who wants to use the git-annex repository.

nssm is supposed to let the user the service runs as be set on the Log on tab, but I cannot get it to accept any user/password there, on my XP test VM. If anyone gets that tab in nssm to work, let me know.
