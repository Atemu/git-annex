runshell contains code that puts it in PATH when run on termux.
However, that relies on `uname -o` reporting "Android",
and git-annex bundles its own uname which didn't (oops).

It seems likely I fixed this in 
[[!commit d14983ee68ac553f3a49e9148ed193fbae722bb8]], although I have
not tried it yet, and the arm64 daily build hasn't been updated yet to
include that fix.
