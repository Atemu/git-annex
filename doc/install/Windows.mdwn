git-annex now does Windows!

* First, [install git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) (msysgit 1.9 or newer is needed)  
  _Be sure to tell the msysgit installer to add git to the PATH._
* Then, [install git-annex](https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/windows/current/)

This port is now in reasonably good shape for command-line use of
git-annex. The assistant and webapp are also usable. There are some known
problems and parts that don't work. See [[todo/windows_support]] for
current status.

The autobuilder is not currently able to run the test suite, so
testing git-annex on Windows is up to you! To check that the build of
git-annex works in your Windows system, you are encouraged to run the test
suite before using git-annex on real data. After installation, run `git
annex test`. There will be a lot of output; the important thing is that it
should end with "All tests passed".

## autobuilds

A daily build is also available, thanks to Yury V. Zaytsev and
[NEST](http://nest-initiative.org/).

## building it yourself

To build git-annex from source on Windows, you need to install
the Haskell Platform, Mingw, and Cygwin. Use Cygwin to install:
gcc rsync git wget ssh gnupg

Once the prerequisites are installed, run:

	cabal update
	git clone git://git-annex.branchable.com/ gitannex
	cd gitannex
	build

(To build the git-annex installer, you also need to install the NulSoft
installer system.)
