Some [[special_remotes]] have support for breaking large files up into
chunks that are stored on the remote.

This can be useful to work around limitations on the size of files
on the remote.

Chunking also allows for resuming interrupted downloads and uploads.

Note that git-annex has to buffer chunks in memory before they are sent to
a remote. So, using a large chunk size will make it use more memory.

To enable chunking, pass a `chunk=XXmb` parameter to `git annex
initremote`.

To disable chunking of a remote that was using chunking,
pass `chunk=0` to `git annex enableremote`. Any content already stored on
the remote using chunks will continue to be accessed via chunks, this
just prevents using chunks when storing new content.

To change the chunk size, pass a `chunk=XXmb` parameter to
`git annex enableremote`. This only affects the chunk sized used when
storing new content.
