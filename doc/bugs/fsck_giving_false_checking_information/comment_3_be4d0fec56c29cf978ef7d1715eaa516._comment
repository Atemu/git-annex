Thanks for clearing it up. It is still a bit confusing that you have to differentiate on the second run. (using --more) I probably view it as inconvenient as it make me have to remember the first and second time of running a command. I think it would be cleaner to have \"--incremental\" always skipping files and \"--incremental restart\" start from the beginning.

Ah great yeah they are different functions and should therefore not interfere. (fsck --fast --incremental)

Great that the checksum is back in and yeah I agree that it isn't really needed in the add command.
