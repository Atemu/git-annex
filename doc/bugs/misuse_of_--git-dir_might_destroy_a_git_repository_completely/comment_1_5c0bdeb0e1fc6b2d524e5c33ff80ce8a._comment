I'm very sorry you encountered this bug. I'd like to do anything
possible to recover your repository. While investigating it, it looks
like, when the repository is not a fresh and empty repo, it doesn't
actually get completely nuked. Instead, the contents of the .git directory,
including annexed objects, is left in "removeme". It should be possible to
mostly recover from that. I can try to walk you through it if necessary.

I know exactly what the cause of this bug is. It's a workaround for a bug
in some by now quite old versions of git-annex (from last year). That old bug
caused a .git/.git directory to be created, and so this workaround looks
for $GIT_DIR/.git and does what turn out to be horrible things in this
case.

So, I have immediately removed that old workaround, so noone else will
encounter this.
