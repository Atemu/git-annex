This seems likely to invole the specific filesystem used for
/media/thk/thk-sg2/. I woud not be surprised if eg FAT had limitations on
filenames with dots.

Generally I think that if the remote being exported to cannot support the
filename, the export should fail. Mangling the filenames should be up to
the user. 

But there should certianly be a better error message than "failed" in this
case, so that at least needs to be fixed.
