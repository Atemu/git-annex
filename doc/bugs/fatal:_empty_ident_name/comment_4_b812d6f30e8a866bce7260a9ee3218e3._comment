Finally I managed to get it working.

My use on the computer didn't had name, so the 5th colum of my /etc/password file was empty. After I filled in my name everything worked like charm.

Interesting that not my user's name from /etc/passwd get into the git log but the one that was in my ~/.gitconfig.
