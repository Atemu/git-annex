Klaus pointed out that there are two problems that keep
git-annex from being used on USB keys, that would typically
be VFAT formatted:

- Use of symlinks, which VFAT does not support. Very hard to fix.
  One possibility is to add [[bare_git_repos]] support, then
  a git repo on a thumb drive could be used to transfer data.
- Use of ":" in filenames of object files, also not supported.
  Could easily be fixed by reorganizing the object directory.
