I understand, and of course it's your prerogative to take that position.  While there are many UNIX shells out there, I'm pretty sure that bash and zsh are the two which combined take the lion share of the market.

If you're worried about the impact of adding `cp .profile .zprofile` to the install, a reasonable alternative would be to document that the install relies on setting up `$PATH` via `.profile` - this confusion only arose in the first place because that mechanism is somewhat hidden rather than taking place directly in the install script.
