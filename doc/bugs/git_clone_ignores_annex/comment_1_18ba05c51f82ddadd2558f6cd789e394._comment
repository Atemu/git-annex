Making that symlink is extremely unsafe! git-annex will see two repositories. So if a file is present in the annex, with only one actual copy existing, and you try to drop it, git-annex will go check the other repository, find the file there, assume this means there's an extra copy and so proceed with the drop. Which deletes the only existing copy of your file. So if you do this, you will likely eventually lose data.

However, recent versions of git-annex will detect if you clone a git repository with `--shared` and automatically hard link files into the annex when getting them into that repository. They also mark the shared clone as untrusted, to avoid the above problem. This is a much better solution.
