### Please describe the problem.
Using the git-annex webapp in remote mode will forward to the wrong IP (localhost) when creating the second repository

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Needs two computers (C1, C2)

- C1: run "git-annex webapp --listen=[IP of C1]
- C2: use a browser to go to the address you just got on C1 (should contain IP of C1)
- C2: create an repository as prompted (should work fine)
- C2: In the dropdown on the top right select "Add another repository", choose desired location, select keep separate
- C2: Browser forwards to new address, but instead of the IP of C1, 127.0.0.1 is used (which obviously fails)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
