The regression appears to behere: $ git diff d80a0f62a4aa5a2a3566f29dd6bda619b1a7eabd..64f8819ae47cc27b164eb69aa846dfb0f7cc6ef3 Process.hs

I rewound each commit until I no longer had the regression. This commit was clean: d80a0f62a4aa5a2a3566f29dd6bda619b1a7eabd. Something with the changes to Process.hs is causing my error.

I validated by building using git checkout d80a0f62a4aa5a2a3566f29dd6bda619b1a7eabd Process.hs and the error went away.
