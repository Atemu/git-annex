Not a bad idea, yoh!

It could be taken further: Keep reading from the file as it grows and hash
incrementally. Use inotify to know when more has been written, or poll
periodically or when PROGRESS is received. If the hash is wrong at the end,
rehash the file. Only remotes that write chunks out of order would pay a
time penalty for that extra hashing.

That could be enabled by a protocol extension. Or disabled by a protocol
extension for that matter, since remotes that write out of order are
probably rare.
