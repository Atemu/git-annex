The first thing to try is going to be a current version of git-annex,
not the wheezy backport, which uses an old and not very good S3 library.

So, upgrade to git-annex 5.20141203 or newer.  
The new aws library used by that version will probably work -- it's
presumably what was used to make <https://gist.github.com/jterrace/4576324>

Even if it fails, will probably fail in a more useful way than throwing
an "Invalid argument" exception.
