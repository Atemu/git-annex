I also can't transfer from and to an Android tablet with the git-annex assistant. The `daemon.log` shows the same error, `Invalid pid specified`, repeated several times.

Enabling the debug log mode always shows lines similar to this one before each \"Invalid pid\" line: `[2013-12-29 14:50:49 WET] chat: nice [\"ionice\", \"-c3\", \"git-annex\", \"transferkeys\"]`.

However, using the `git annex get` and `git annex copy` commands to fetch and send the files from the same tablet work as expected.

I can post the full log later, if needed.
