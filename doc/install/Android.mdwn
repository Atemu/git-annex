git-annex can be used on Android, however you need to know your way around
the command line to install and use it. (Hope to get the webapp working eventually.)

## android app

First, ensure your Android device is configured to allow installation of
non-Market apps. Go to Setup -&gt; Security -&gt; and enable "Unknown Sources".

Download the [git-annex.apk](http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/android/current/)
onto your Android device, and open it to install.

When you start the Git Annex app, it will dump you into terminal.
From here, you can run git-annex, as well as many standard git and unix commands
provided with the app. You can do everything in the [[walkthrough]] and more.

## building it yourself

git-annex can be built for Android, with `make android`.
You need <https://github.com/neurocyte/ghc-android> installed first,
and also have to `cabal install` all necessary dependencies. This is not
yet an easy process. 

You also need to install git and all the utilities listed on [[fromscratch]].

Then to build the full Android app bundle, use `make androidapp`. You will
need to have the Android SDK and NDK installed; edit
`standalone/android/Makefile` to configure the paths to them.
