### Please describe the problem.

The `--file` option doesn't work with youtube-dl downloaded content unless --fast or --relaxed are passed.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

[[!format sh """
$ git annex addurl --file out.m4a https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08jsctb
addurl https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08jsctb
... (cut most youtube-dl output)
[download] Destination: Bloodsport, Introducing Bloodsport-p08jscdd.m4a
[download] 100% of 909.06KiB in 00:03
[ffmpeg] Correcting container in "Bloodsport, Introducing Bloodsport-p08jscdd.m4a"
(to Bloodsport, Introducing Bloodsport-p08jscdd.m4a) ok
(recording state in git...)
$ ls
'Bloodsport, Introducing Bloodsport-p08jscdd.m4a'
"""]]

Whereas I expected the created file to be 'out.m4a'.

However it works correctly when using --fast or --relaxed to set the URL, and then using git annex get separately:

[[!format sh """
$ git annex addurl --relaxed --file out.m4a https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08jsctb
addurl https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08jsctb (to out.m4a) ok
(recording state in git...)
$ ls
out.m4a
$ git annex get out.m4a
get out.m4a (from web...)
... (cut most youtube-dl output)
[download] Destination: Bloodsport, Introducing Bloodsport-p08jscdd.m4a
[download] 100% of 909.06KiB in 00:01
[ffmpeg] Correcting container in "Bloodsport, Introducing Bloodsport-p08jscdd.m4a"
ok
(recording state in git...)
$ ls
out.m4a
"""]]
