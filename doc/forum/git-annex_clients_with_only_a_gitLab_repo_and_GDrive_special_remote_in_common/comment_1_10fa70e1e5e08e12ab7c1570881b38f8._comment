Recent versions of git-annex have a git-lfs special
remote, and gitlab does support git-lfs, so git-annex
can store data on it. That does not answer your question, just wanted to
mention it.

For the assistant to quickly notice changes, it needs to be able to talk to
a git-annex-shell on the remote's server. As a fallback, it does poll
remotes periodically that don't have git-annex on them.  That's done once
per hour, and also when network connection changes are detected.

If you need to poll more frequently, you can install a cron job that does a
git pull.
