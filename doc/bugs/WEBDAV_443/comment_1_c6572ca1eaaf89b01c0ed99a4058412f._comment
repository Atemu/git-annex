The i386 standalone build for 4.20130314, which is IIRC repackaged by Arch linux, was made using a known broken webdav library. I've since updated that build to use a new version of webdav. Since it only affected that one build, I do not plan to do a full re-release with a new version number.

Probably Arch needs to update their package.
