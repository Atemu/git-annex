Direct mode merge handles the case where there's a conflict between local and remote files, that are checked into git.

However, the the local file (or directory, or symlink, whatever)
is not checked into git, the merge will overwrite it with the remote file from git.

New problem: If the merge pulls in a directory, and a file exists with
the name of the directory, locally, not annexed, the file is left alone,
but the directory is thus not checked out, and will be deleted on commit.
