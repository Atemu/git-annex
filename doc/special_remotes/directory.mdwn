This special remote type stores file contents in directory.

One use case for this would be if you have a removable drive that
you want to use it to sneakernet files between systems (possibly with
[[encrypted|encryption]] contents). Just set up both systems to use
the drive's mountpoint as a directory remote.

## configuration

These parameters can be passed to `git annex initremote` to configure the
remote:

* `encryption` - Required. Either "none" to disable encryption,
  or a value that can be looked up (using gpg -k) to find a gpg encryption
  key that will be given access to the remote, or "shared" which allows
  every clone of the repository to decrypt the encrypted data.

  Note that additional gpg keys can be given access to a remote by
  rerunning initremote with the new key id. See [[encryption]].

* `chunksize` - Avoid storing files larger than the specified size in the
  directory. For use on directories on mount points that have file size
  limitations. The default is to never chunk files.  
  The value can use specified using any commonly used units.
  Example: `chunksize=100 megabytes`  
  Note that enabling chunking on an existing remote with non-chunked
  files is not recommended.

Setup example:

	# git annex initremote usbdrive type=directory directory=/media/usbdrive/ encryption=none
	# git annex describe usbdrive "usb drive on /media/usbdrive/"
