When I create a new blank annex and try to sync it, I immediately run out of
space.

This is the original:

    $ git annex info 
    repository mode: indirect
    trusted repositories: 0
    semitrusted repositories: 4
        00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 -- web
        ...
    untrusted repositories: 0
    transfers in progress: none
    available local disk space: 50.51 gigabytes (+1 megabyte reserved)
    local annex keys: 2581
    local annex size: 135.87 gigabytes
    annexed files in working tree: 4672
    size of annexed files in working tree: 231.16 gigabytes
    bloom filter size: 16 mebibytes (0.5% full)
    backend usage: 
        SHA256E: 7253

Then I try to sync on the newly created annex:

    $ git annex sync 
    commit  ok
    pull laptop
    warning: no common commits
    remote: Counting objects: 28801, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (20301/20301), done.
    fatal: write error: No space left on device22 MiB | 13.30 MiB/s   
    fatal: index-pack failed
    failed
    git-annex: sync: 1 failed

Now `.git` in the new annex is using 487M (this is the total size of mounted disk):

    $ du -sh .git/
    487M	.git/

How big should the target annex be? Is it a multiple of the remote?
