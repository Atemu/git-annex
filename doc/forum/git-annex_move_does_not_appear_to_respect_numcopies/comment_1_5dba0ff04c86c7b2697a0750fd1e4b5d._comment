Well.. it actually says this in the source code for the move command:

    - Note that unlike drop, this does not honor numcopies.
    - A file's content can be moved even if there are insufficient copies to
    - allow it to be dropped.

So the behaviour seems to be known/intended. You told it to move the file, so it did.
Perhaps it should output a warning if numcopies is not satisfied after the move?
