Do I understand correctly that in .git/annex/objects dir there should be no duplicates?
Here follows a run of 'rdfind' done in the objects dir:

    $ rdfind .
    Now scanning \".\", found 12874 files.
    Now have 12874 files in total.
    Removed 0 files due to nonunique device and inode.
    Total size is 75579281486 bytes or 70 GiB
    Removed 8376 files due to unique sizes from list.4498 files left.
    Now eliminating candidates based on first bytes:removed 68 files from list.4430 files left.
    Now eliminating candidates based on last bytes:removed 66 files from list.4364 files left.
    Now eliminating candidates based on sha1 checksum:removed 0 files from list.4364 files left.
    It seems like you have 4364 files that are not unique
    Totally, 10 GiB can be reduced.
    Now making results file results.txt

And here is an example pair of dupes (excerpt from the abovementioned 'results.txt'):

    DUPTYPE_FIRST_OCCURRENCE 2073 3 86558 26 21057567 1 ./53/zv/SHA256E-s86558--e79a0891bb94fc9212ce2f28178fe84591c5fb24c07b5239d367099118e12ede.jpg/SHA256E-s86558--e79a0891bb94fc9212ce2f28178fe84591c5fb24c07b5239d367099118e12ede.jpg

Any clues?

Thank you
