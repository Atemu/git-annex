Correction:

Why do moves that require changes to the symlinks to change result in a delete+add combo?

Code to reproduce just for the sake of completion:

```bash
mkdir protein
echo whey > protein/milk

git init
git annex init
git annex add
git commit -m \"asd\"

# perfectly normal rename
git mv protein amino-acids
git commit -m changed
# rename {protein => amino-acids}/milk (100%)

# behavior I don't get
git mv amino-acids/milk atoms
git commit -m hmmm
# delete mode 120000 amino-acids/milk
# create mode 120000 atoms
```

I'm sorry if this has been already explained previously.
I couldn't find it.
