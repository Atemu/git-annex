I took a closer look at the [man page for `git-annex-sync`](http://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-sync/).

My understanding is that running it without any options will

1. commit any changes (presumably something like `commit -am 'some default message?'`)
2. fetch and merge `synced/$(currentbranch)` and `git-annex` branches (presumably from *all* remotes unless o/w configured)
3. push the branches from (2) back to the remotes

I'm realizing that what I really want is a `git-annex-sync` command that will *just* sync `git-annex` content. The workflow I'd like is

1. fetch and merge `git-annex` branch from all remotes (or as specified by arguments)
2. push `git-annex` branch back to remotes from (1)
3. If _content_ related flags in the style of arguments from `git-annex-sync` (e.g., `--content`) are passed, sync them around.

So the command I think I'm looking for is something like `git annex sync --no-commit --branch git-annex`, but since it's still in todo, I assume the `--branch git-annex` behavior is not yet implemented. 
Moreover, it seems I can configure the `--no-commit` option to be the default by setting the `annex.autocommit` option to false (and this setting is handled by the `git-annex` branch, with options for local override via local gitconfig). If `--branch` gets implemented, I'd love for there to be a similar config-level option like `annex.synccurrentbranch` with true giving the current (default) behavior wherein the current branch is fetch/merge/pushed, and `annex.synccurrentbranch` giving an alternate behavior akin to the hypothetical `git annex sync --branch git-annex`.

Of course I think both features (adding `--branch` option to `git-annex-sync`; supporting `annex.synccurrentbranch` config) would be useful, but really just the latter would be enough for what I'm looking to do.

Thanks for your consideration and for such an excellent tool; it's really been a gamechanger for me.
