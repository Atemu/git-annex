fsck has checked required content (across all repos) since version 6.20180227.

There are many ways that some copies of a file could be lost without the
user really noticing, so it makes sense for fsck to check numcopies.

The local/global distinction you are trying to draw is not one I'm really
interested in drawing with fsck. It checks everything that it's practical
for it to check that we've thought of checking.

If you don't want to check all keys in a bare repo, you can use 
`git annex fsck --branch=master` to only check the files in the master
branch.
