It doesn't work well if the source of the copy is in a btrfs subvolume and the cache is in another subvolume of the same filesystem.

With that setup every file is really copied instead of using reflink=always.

I solved it currently by copying .git/annex/objects manual into the cache (`cp -a --reflink=always .git/annex/objects ~/.cache/annex/` and afterwards doing the git annex cp which recognice the existence of the objects.
