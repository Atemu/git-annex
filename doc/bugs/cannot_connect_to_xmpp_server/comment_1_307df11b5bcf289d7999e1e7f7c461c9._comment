I've fixed the gmail.com problem. It was trying all the servers returned by the SRV query, which all failed due to the bad password, and then fell back to trying gmail.com directly. For whatever reason, gmail.com will accept XMPP connections, but never responds to traffic, so it hung.

The hang with your own XMPP server does not seem related to that.
