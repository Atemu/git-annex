The tarballs produced by gitweb are actually stable. They are wrapped in a gz file with a varying timestamp however. It might be nice if gitweb passed --no-name to gzip to avoid that inconsistency.

git-annex also has a [pristine-tar](http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/pristine-tar/) branch in git that can be used to recreate the tarballs I upload to Debian.
