What steps will reproduce the problem?

Run git annex reinject source dest with a file that has the wrong content and thus a wrong checksum.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The file should stay in it's original location. Currently it's moved to .git/annex/bad with a mangled filename.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version: 3.20120807
Ubuntu 12.04 updated on Aug 20th
annex was installed via cabal on Aug 20th, all other packages are from ubuntu.
