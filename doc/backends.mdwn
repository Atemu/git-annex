When a file is annexed, a key is generated from its content and/or metadata.
The file checked into git symlinks to the key. This key can later be used
to retrieve the file's content (its value).

Multiple pluggable key-value backends are supported, and a single repository
can use different ones for different files.

* `SHA256` -- The default backend for new files. This allows
  verifying that the file content is right, and can avoid duplicates of
  files with the same content. Its need to generate checksums
  can make it slower for large files. 
* `WORM` ("Write Once, Read Many") This assumes that any file with
  the same basename, size, and modification time has the same content.
  This is the the least expensive backend, recommended for really large
  files or slow systems.
* `SHA512` -- Best currently available hash, for the very paranoid.
* `SHA1` -- Smaller hash than `SHA256` for those who want a checksum
   but are not concerned about security.
* `SHA384`, `SHA224` -- Hashes for people who like unusual sizes.
* `SHA256E`, `SHA1E`, etc -- Variants that preserve filename extension as
  part of the key. Useful for archival tasks where the filename extension
  contains metadata that should be preserved.

The `annex.backends` git-config setting can be used to list the backends
git-annex should use. The first one listed will be used by default when
new files are added.

For finer control of what backend is used when adding different types of
files, the `.gitattributes` file can be used. The `annex.backend`
attribute can be set to the name of the backend to use for matching files.

For example, to use the SHA256 backend for sound files, which tend to be
smallish and might be modified or copied over time,
while using the WORM backend for everything else, you could set
in `.gitattributes`:

	* annex.backend=WORM
	*.mp3 annex.backend=SHA256
	*.ogg annex.backend=SHA256
