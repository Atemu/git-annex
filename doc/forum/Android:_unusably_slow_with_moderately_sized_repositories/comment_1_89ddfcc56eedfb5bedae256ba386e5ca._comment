Update: So after about 16 hours, route 2 seems to be completed. But then, the behavior is something I do not understand:
- I create a file in the computer and the log there shows it gets created and added in the repo in the computer

[2015-02-26 18:33:40 CET] Committer: Adding A
add A-test/A ok
add A-test/A ok
[2015-02-26 18:33:40 CET] Committer: Committing changes to git
(Recording state in git...)
(Recording state in git...)


- But the android is spinning for minutes and minutes without doing anything. I restart it, and it takes it more than 20' to finish the scan, and then its start syncing, but to no avail:

(scanning...) [2015-02-26 18:37:15 CET] Watcher: Performing startup scan
(started...) 
[2015-02-26 18:58:05 CET] main: Syncing with xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx__home_someone_somewhere 

(yes, I can connect from the android to the computer using ssh from another app ---connect bot)


So I think maybe I am misuing git annex somehow?
