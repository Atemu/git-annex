# SYNOPSIS

git-annex-shell [-c] command [params ...]

# DESCRIPTION

git-annex-shell is a restricted shell, similar to git-shell, which
can be used as a login shell for SSH accounts.

# COMMANDS

* configlist directory

  This outputs the git configuration, in the same form as
  `git config --list`

* inannex directory [key ...]

  This checks if all specified keys are present in the annex, 
  and exits zero if so.

* dropkey directory [key ...]

  This drops the annexed data for the specified keys.

* recvkey directory key

  This runs rsync in server mode to receive the content of a key,
  and stores the content in the annex.

* sendkey directory key

  This runs rsync in server mode to transfer out the content of a key.

Note that the directory parameter should be an absolute path, otherwise
it is assumed to be relative to the user's home directory. Also the
first "/~/" or "/~user/" is expanded to the specified home directory.

Any other command is passed through to git-shell.
