Hi Joey,

I've raised a bug ( https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/Can__39__t_compile_on_FreeBSD__58____Issues_with_System.Posix.Files/ ) as requested.  I also happen to have a machine sitting around at home that I can configure for SSH access, if you or anyone would like a current (FreeBSD 11.1) dev environment to use.  Let me know.

Yours,
Duncan
