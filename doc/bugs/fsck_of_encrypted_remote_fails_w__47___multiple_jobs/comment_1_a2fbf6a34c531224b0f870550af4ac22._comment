The command that you show failing does not seem to have concurrency
enabled. Then you explicitly disable concurrency with -J 1 and it succeeds.
Do you have annex.jobs set, and if so, to what?

There is something very odd about "(checking s3...) (checking s3...)
(checking s3...)" etc. I suspect you also have chunking enabled, and it is
displaying that once per chunk, in which case it's probably not much of a
clue about the problem. However, it highlights that you have really not
explained how this remote is set up; it would be useful to provide enough
information to reproduce the bug from scratch.
