The failure on mips seems to be due to NFS locking issues preventing deleting a
directory. Running the test suite on NFS is likely to turn up this kind of
problem. It should not be too hard to fix it, Utility.Gpg.testHarness probably
just needs to catch more exceptions than the IO exceptions it already catches.

The other two failures probably have the same underlying cause, it's a race
condition or something like that involving unlocked files.

I've been seeing this failure intermittently on the git-annex autobuilders
for months, it's not a new problem. Probably longer than that, but there
was another intermittent problem, since fixed, that occurred more often and
so I probably didn't notice these.

I think that disabling that part of the test suite would be a reasonable
workaround, since if this is like the previous race it's unlikely to occur
except when git-annex is used in the test suite or perhaps a script that runs a
problimatic sequence of commands at a given speed.

Unfortunatly it's not at all clear how it's failing, there's no useful error
message about what went wrong. If I had a good way to reproduce it I think I could
get to the bottom of it in fairly short order.
