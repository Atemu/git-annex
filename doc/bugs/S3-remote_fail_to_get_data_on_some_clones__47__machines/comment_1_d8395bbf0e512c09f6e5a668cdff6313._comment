Things are getting weirder.
There is no traffic coming out of my machine (`tcpdump`) when running the `git-annex get`.
When I run curl pointing to the same https address, it works, the server receives the request.
I tried the standalone version, different versions from ubuntu repos, conda-forge, all the same on Ubuntu 18.04 machines, finally from a docker-container with anaconda (debian-based I think), same thing.

When I connect to my cellphone as a hotspot, it works!
Is there any way to have more debug from the S3 remote code, or from haskell S3 or network packages?

I am loosing my mind here.
Help :/

Thanks!
