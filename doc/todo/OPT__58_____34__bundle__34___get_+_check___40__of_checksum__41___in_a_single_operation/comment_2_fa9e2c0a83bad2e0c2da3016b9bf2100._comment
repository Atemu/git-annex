> An external remote could also do its own checksum checking and then set `remote..annex-verify=false`

that is an interesting idea, thanks!  Not sure if that makes it easy for mass consumption though since it is a feature of a external remote, not sure why it should be in the config.  Ideally it should be a property of a remote.

Joey, what do you think in regard of built-in remotes?
