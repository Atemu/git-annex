What is \"runshell\"? I used the binary from inside the app, maybe that's the issue? How am I supposed to use it from the command line? I had used a 2012 version installed via cabal before, but upgrading it didn't work anymore. I got lot's of errors from various cabal packages when I tried.

Directly it seems to work fine:

I'm actually using SHA512E. I will try later to reproduce with just that file in another repository. Is there anything else I can provide?
