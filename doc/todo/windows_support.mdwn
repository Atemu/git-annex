The git-annex Windows port is not ready for prime time. But it does exist
now! --[[Joey]] 

## status

* Does not work with Cygwin's build of git (that git does not consistently
  support use of DOS style paths, which git-annex uses on Windows). 
  Must use Msysgit.
* rsync special remotes are known buggy.
* Bad file locking, it's probably not safe to run more than one git-annex
  process at the same time on Windows.
* Ssh connection caching does not work on Windows, so `git annex get`
  has to connect twice to the remote system over ssh per file, which
  is much slower than on systems supporting connection caching.
* `git annex watch` works, but does not detect when files are still open
  for write as they're being added (no lsof). So watch/webapp/assistant
  have to be started with --force, and may be unsafe. (Also breaks initial
  repo creation, autostart, restarting, etc, as --force is not propigated.)
* `git annex assistant` has not been tested, is probably quite incomplete.
  Is known to not download any files. (transferrer doesn't built yet)
* webapp: Odd problem when using Firefox: Some links don't seem to load.
  Clicking on such a link repeatedly will eventually load the right page.
  Network console shows web browser is requesting page "/"
  despite a link to another page being clicked on. Workaround: Use Chrome
  instead; no such problem there.
* No XMPP support (needs a lot of C libraries which are available in
  cygwin, but pkg-config does not list them once installed).
