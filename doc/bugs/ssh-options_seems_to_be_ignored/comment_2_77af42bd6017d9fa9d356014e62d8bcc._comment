It does manage to pass the ControlMaster, etc. options there, so could the ssh-options be added? Or if backwards-compatibility is a worry, another option be added for that? I guess it's possible someone would want different SSH options for bulk data transfer.

It would be nice to be able to pass that `-i` option.
