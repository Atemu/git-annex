[[!toggleable text="""
   * Fix Debian package to not try to run test suite, since haskell-tasty
     is not out of new or in Build-Depends yet.
   * dropunused, addunused: Allow "all" instead of a range to
     act on all unused data.
   * Ensure execute bit is set on directories when core.sharedrepository is set.
   * Ensure that core.sharedrepository is honored when creating the .git/annex
     directory.
   * Improve repair code in the case where the index file is corrupt,
     and this hides other problems from git fsck."""]]
