Thanks to your feedback, I got it going.  

Maybe those two should be added to the 'OSX how-to' in the forum   

[realizes pcre-light is needed but pcre not installed on my mac]  
sudo port install pcre  
sudo cabal install pcre-light  

[tests are failing, need haskell's quickcheck]  
sudo cabal install quickcheck
