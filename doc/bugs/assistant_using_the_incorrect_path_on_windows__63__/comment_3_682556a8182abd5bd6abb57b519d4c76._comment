Yea, the only relevant change I noticed was 5c834daf5, and it's not particularly relevant.

However, its occurred to me that I started the webapp differently this time than last; I used the start menu shortcut this time rather than typing git annex webapp in the git shell. It's not surprising that the environment variables would be quite different between the two.
