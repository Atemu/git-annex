You're right, with an unencrypted git repo in between it works.
I was hoping to be able to avoid that, though.

My very first try was actually to switch XMPP servers, because I thought they might be the problem. But after trying both servers you mentioned in the assistant and on the instruction pages (Google and jabber.me) I figured it should at least work with one of them...

So if XMPP can actually only be used as a simple signaling mechanism, this should be mentioned explicitly in the \"remote sharing\" and \"share with a friend\" walkthroughs. 
After reading/watching them I was under the impression, that after setting up XMPP, you can use any cloud storage to exchange files.
But if I now understand correctly this cloud storage needs to have a full git repo, not only the encrypted files.
And for Android you cannot use a gcrypt remote, so only unencrypted git repos are possible, making any public cloud service unfeasible.

Is my conclusion correct, that this leaves only one option when sharing with Android?
1) unencrypted git repo on trusted/private special remote

Or am I missing something?

Thanks again for this!
