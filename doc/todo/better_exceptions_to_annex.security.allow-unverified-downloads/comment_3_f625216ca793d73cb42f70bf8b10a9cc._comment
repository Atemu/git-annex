\"I thought about adding something to the external special remote protocol to let them indicate what they are not vulnerable to CVE-2018-10857\" -- you could instead add a special remote message FETCH_URL_FOR_ME that asks git-annex to fetch the URL, and git-annex can then fetch it with its internal fetcher that does the needed security checks.
