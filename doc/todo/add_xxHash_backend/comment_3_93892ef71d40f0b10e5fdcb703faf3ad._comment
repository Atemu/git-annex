https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/ now includes blake2, and xxh3 is much
faster, 28 times as fast.

Would need haskell library, http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xxhash is
out of date. It would probably not be hard to make a xxh3 haskell library,
but I'm inclined to wait for someone who really wants it.

Interestingly, the ghc RTS uses xxhash and recently updated to xxh3.

But I don't think that's exposed to haskell code.
