# What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Get a removable device and create a filesystem with a label containing a space, e.g.:
    # mkfs.ext4 -L "Backup Home" /dev/sdb1
2. Open the webapp and add a new repository on a removabledevice
3. Select the devices mountpoint, e.g. /media/Backup\ Home

# What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

The configurator should remove spaces for branch names, but it actually seems to call git remote add with "Backup Home" as argument which is invalid.

The assistant produces an internal server error and subsequently crashes completely.

# What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 3.20120924 from the Debian package in sid on Debian wheezy, amd64.
