@Rizwan yes, the things documented here still work. But, they drop old
history about the past locations of files, they do not drop *all* information
about the current locations of files. git-annex is keeping track of which
files you have stored in the local repository and on the remote, and that
information necessisarily takes up space.

You're using git-annex with small files -- around 12
kilobytes average file size. It's designed for mostly much larger files,
so you will see a larger percentage of overhead in using it than you would
if your files were bigger.
