### Please describe the problem.
On Windows, with a remote repository configured for HTTP access, wget is never used, even if it's available in the system. curl is always used.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Set up an annex on a remote system, configure it for HTTP access, run an HTTP server.
2. over HTTP, clone it to Windows
3. "annex get -vd <file>"
4. note that curl is used.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Windows 7: 4.20140627-g8a36ec5 (from the git-annex download page)

### Additional Info
After some debugging, it appears the issue is that git-annex looks to see if the file 'wget' is available in any directory on the PATH. on windows, wget is installed as 'wget.exe', and the file 'wget' does not exist anywhere. creating a file named 'wget' works around the issue. (wget.exe appears to still be the file used)
