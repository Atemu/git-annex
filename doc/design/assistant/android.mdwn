Porting git-annex to Android will use the Android native SDK.

A hopefully small Java app will be developed, which runs the webapp
daemon, and a web browser to display it.

### programs to port

These will probably need to be bundled into the Android app, unless already
available in the App Store.

* ssh (native ssh needed for scp, not a client like ConnectBot)
* rsync
* gpg
* git (not all git commands are needed,
  but core plumbing and a few like `git-add` are.)

## GHC Android?

Android's native SDK does not use glibc. GHC's runtime links with glibc.
This could be an enormous problem. Other people want to see GHC able to
target Android, of course, so someone may solve it before I get stuck on
it.

I've heard anecdoally that ipwnstudios not only has an IPhone GHC port,
but also Android. Need to get in touch with them.

### Android specific features

The app should be aware of power status, and avoid expensive background
jobs when low on battery or run flat out when plugged in.

The app should be aware of network status, and avoid expensive data
transfers when not on wifi. This may need to be configurable.

## FAT

Due to use of the FAT filesystem, which doesn't do symlinks, [[desymlink]]
is probably needed for at least older Android devices that have SD cards.
