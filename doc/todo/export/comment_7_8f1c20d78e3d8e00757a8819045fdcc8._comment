I was hoping to use export as a way of exporting my repository to a server where I'd like non-git users to be able to directly access the files. 
The server is a Synology box, and I would like users to be able to see and download files through File Station. I have successfully set up git-annex on this box, but when I tried navigating to the path of the repository in File Station, it seems that File Station was not able to follow the symbolic links to download file contents. I then thought of using export in combination with an rsync special remote, but git annex returns an error saying that exporttree=yes is not support for this kind of remote. Is this something that could be fixed in future versions, or is there something about rsync special remote that prevents export from working in principle?
