`git annex find --want-get --not --in here` should simulate get --auto/sync well

`git annex find --want-drop --in here` will simulate what drop --auto/sync would
try to drop

What would be nice to have is a way to simulate `copy --auto --to foo`
and `drop --auto --from foo` which are of course also things sync does.
That could be something like:

	git annex find --want-get-by remote --not --in remote
	git annex find --want-drop-by remote --in remote
