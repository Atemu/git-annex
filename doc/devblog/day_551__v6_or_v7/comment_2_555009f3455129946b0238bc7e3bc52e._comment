I would prefer making it v7 so that it can be done automatically. I've got a large number of git-annex repositories (between 10-15) checked out on many boxes. I have upgraded some to v6, but I'm not sure I remember which (though I could find out). Having it be automatic would be preferable so that I wouldn't have to manually go check.
