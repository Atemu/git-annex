What steps will reproduce the problem?

Install git-annex via cabal - either from Hackage or as a manual install. (i.e. <http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/cabal/>)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Expect a clean install.

However, get the following error:

      Configuring gnuidn-0.2...
      cabal: The program c2hs is required but it could not be found.
      Failed to install gnuidn-0.2
      cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
      git-annex-3.20121127 depends on gnuidn-0.2 which failed to install.
      gnuidn-0.2 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
      ExitFailure 1
      network-protocol-xmpp-0.4.4 depends on gnuidn-0.2 which failed to install.

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex: 3.20121127 (and previous versions)

OS: Mac OSX 10.6.8


Please provide any additional information below.

The fix seems as easy as

    cabal install c2hs

Should c2hs be included as a dep got git-annex or is this a bug in gnuidn?
