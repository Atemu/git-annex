network-info is where IPv4 and IPv6 are defined. You have chosen to installs it \"dev\" branch, which removes those and has a top commit of \"wip - don't pull this, not working on unix yet\".

What you should really do is just disable local pairing, which avoids the need for porting network-info to openbsd. You can do so by passing -f-Pairing to cabal configure. There are lots of other features that can be similarly disabled if their necessary depedencies cannot be installed (normally this is done automatically.)
