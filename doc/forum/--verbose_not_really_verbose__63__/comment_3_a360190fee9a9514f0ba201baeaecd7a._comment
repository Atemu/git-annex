What git-annex is working on doing here is adding all the data it had
started recording when you interrupted it before to the git-annex branch.

If it had imported a large number of files, that could take a while.
The number of files in .git/annex/journal/ is a good indication of how much
work it needs to do (but all the files will remain there until it's finished).

Normally with a fairly large number of files like a thousand or so, this
step takes less than 1 second..

--verbose is the default verbosity level BTW.
