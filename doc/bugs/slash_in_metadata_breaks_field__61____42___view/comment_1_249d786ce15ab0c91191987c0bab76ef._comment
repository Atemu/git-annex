I was able to reproduce this problem, but only with LANG=C. It works in a
unicode locale.

What's torpedoing this is a hack that it uses to handle "/" in a view.

	pseudoSlash :: Char
	pseudoSlash = '\8725' -- 'âˆ•' /= '/'

It's necessary that in a view, each viewed metadata component yield exactly one
level of directory hierarchy. Otherwise, it would be impossible to reverse
"a/b/c/file" when viewing on 2 metadata components -- 
is that "a/b" and "c" or "a" and "b/c"?

Which is why I used this cutsey hack, but yeah, it requires working
unicode support.

Sigh, 2016 and still can't have nice things.. Suppose it'll have to use an
ugly encoding for them instead.

Update: Can have nice things, just have to encode the characters using the
FileSystemEncoding!
