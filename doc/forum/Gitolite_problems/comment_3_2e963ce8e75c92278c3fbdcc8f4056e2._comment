Thanks Renaud. I am using a rsync special remote and I couldn't get it to start!

I assume the normal way to get it to work would be to use git annex init on the remote, but I don't have git annex on the remote server. I used your method to bypass that issue.

I think it would be really helpful if the documentation explained better how to use the special remotes. But! I should post that somewhere else.

To be clear, here is what I did:

1. create new folder on local
2. git init and git annex init inside that folder
3. git clone --bare the original repository to the new repository
4. add new repository as a remote for the old repository
5. push old repository information to new
6. move new repository to another server
7. update new repository as a remote for the old repository
8. sync and it should be good to go!

At least, I think that's how I did it ;-)
