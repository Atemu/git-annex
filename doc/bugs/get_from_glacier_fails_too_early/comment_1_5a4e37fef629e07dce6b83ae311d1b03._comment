Wow, the code seems to neglect to actually set up a pipe from glacier-cli's
stdout. It seems this broke quite a while ago, in
[[!commit fb19d56476bb6eb5aa4d794a10199adb267d5870]] and nobody noticed.

I have committed what should be a fix, but it's pretty hard for me to test
this. Can you please either test the current daily autobuild for linux
amd64 (should be ready about 15 minutes after I post this comment), or
build git-annex from master and test?
