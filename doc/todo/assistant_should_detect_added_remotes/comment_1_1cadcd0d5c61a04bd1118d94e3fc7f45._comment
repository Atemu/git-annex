The assistant watches for changes to the git-annex branch, and reloads its
list of remotes within 60 seconds after a change.

If you're using `git remote add`, that doesn't affect the git-annex branch,
so the assistant won't notice the new remote. Once `git annex
sync` with that remote, the git-annex branch will be updated and the
assistant will notice it then.
