As I tried to set this up for myself, this what I did to get it working with a nixos ssh server:

I put the following in _~/.ssh/rc_:

    PATH=$HOME/bin:$HOME/.nix-profile/bin:/run/current-system/sw/bin

As which is an alias (and hence still doesn't work for 'ssh foo which rsync'), I added a shell script named _which_:

    #!/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash
    type -P $@
