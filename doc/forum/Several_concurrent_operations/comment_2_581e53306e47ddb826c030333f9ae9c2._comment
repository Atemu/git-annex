So, indeed it works. However, syncing a large archive (2TB, ~1M objects) over several USB HDDs at the same time ended up a bad idea: inevitably at some point every process tried syncing with the same, slowest, repository, and lack of good I/O concurrency on a USB-connected HDD killed all performance. I'm guessing that introducing some targetted locking could probably help, or even maybe just randomizing the order in which repositories are pulled from/pushed to.
