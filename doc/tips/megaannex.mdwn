For using [Mega](https://mega.nz)
as a special remote, there are currently three choices:

* There is a dedicated special remote,
  <https://github.com/dxtr/megaannex-go>  
  Last updated 2016
* Alternatively, rclone supports Mega,
  so the [[rclone_special_remote|special_remotes/rclone]] can be used.
* Alternatively, there's an older dedicated special remote,
  <https://github.com/TobiasTheViking/megaannex>  
  Reported to be no longer working

At this time it's not clear which is better, so if you find one works
best, please comment below.
