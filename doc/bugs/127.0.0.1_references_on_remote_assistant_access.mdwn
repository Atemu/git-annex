### Please describe the problem.
When I use git-annex webapp with a remote IP of a headless computer, I am sometimes redirected to a 127.0.0.1 address (with a different port as well)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Install git-annex as usual. 
2. Open git-annex assistant from a headless machine and access the webapp with the --listen option. (e.g. git annex webapp --listen=xxx.yyy.zzz.www)
3. Create your first local repository. Then create a second local repository.
4. When assistant asks you if you want to merge these 2 repositories, try to select the second option (to keep them separated).
5. You are redirected from your remote IP to 127.0.0.1 to a new port number.

(I also encountered the same error at another menu or function, but I don't remember where. Sorry.) 

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
4.20130815
Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit (kernel 3.11.0-13-generic x86_64)

### Please provide any additional information below.
Please ask me for any additional information that may be useful.
