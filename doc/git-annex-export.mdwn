# NAME

git-annex export - export content to a remote

# SYNOPSIS

git annex export `treeish --to remote`

# DESCRIPTION

Use this command to export a tree of files from a git-annex repository.

Normally files are stored on a git-annex special remote named by their
keys. That is great for reliable data storage, but your filenames are
obscured. Exporting replicates the tree to the special remote as-is.

Mixing key/value storage and exports in the same remote would be a mess and
so is not allowed. You have to configure a remote with `exporttree=yes`
when initially setting it up with [[git-annex-initremote]](1).

Repeated exports are done efficiently, by diffing the old and new tree,
and transferring only the changed files.

Exports can be interrupted and resumed. However, partially uploaded files
will be re-started from the beginning.

Once content has been exported to a remote, commands like `git annex get`
can download content from there the same as from other remotes. However,
since an export is not a key/value store, git-annex has to do more
verification of content downloaded from an export. Some types of keys,
that are not based on checksums, cannot be downloaded from an export.
And, git-annex will never trust an export to retain the content of a key.
