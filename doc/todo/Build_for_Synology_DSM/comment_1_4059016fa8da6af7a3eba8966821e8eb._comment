There are already git-annex builds for arm available from eg, Debian. There's a good chance that, assuming you match up the arm variant (armel, armhf, etc) and that the NAS uses glibc and does not have too old a version, that the binary could just be copied in, possibly with some other libraries, and work. This is what's done for the existing Linux standalone builds.

So, I look at this bug report as \"please add a standalone build for arm\", not as a request to support a specific NAS which I don't have ;)
