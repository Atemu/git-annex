How does GHC complain about "runner"? Would
-XNoMonomorphismRestriction fix it? I don't like the suggested change
because seeing that code, I'd naturally want to refactor it back to
something like how it's currently written.. (Still, I've applied the patch
for now.)

I've relaxed the bounds on base. AFAICS there are no bounds on time and
transformers, so what were you suggesting I change there?

I've applied your change to Setup-Depends. Oddly, I seem to remember
trying the Setup-Depends with the new cabal and thought it was working..
