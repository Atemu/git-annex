* When a file is moved into archive/, the assistant that sends it to
  glacier is able to trust that it's in glacier and remove the local copy.
  But other assistants that also have a copy cannot trust that, and so
  don't remove their copies.

* For that matter, glacier-cli currently relies on a local cache of
  inventory information, and so other git-annexes using the same glacier
  repository are not able to access stuff in it, unless and until
  `glacier vault sync` is run.
