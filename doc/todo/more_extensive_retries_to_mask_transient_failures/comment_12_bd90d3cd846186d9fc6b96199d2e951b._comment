Also, anything that catches SomeException could catch an async exception
that was intended to interrupt the thread. Probably need to make a specific
exception for thread interrupts, and make everything that catches
SomeException mask out that exception.

And, there may be data structures that get filled with a value and need to
be emptied again on an async exception. Things like the lock pool. Need
to somehow audit for those.

And for that matter, should audit for any code that opens file handles w/o
bracketing, because I'm not really positive it's all bracketed.
