I wonder if you've tried addurl --fast with a recent version of git-annex?

Since it recently stopped shelling out to curl for every url, it keeps a
http connection open to the server, and is limited only by network
latency. Combined with -J10, it might be fast enough now to not be a
serious bottleneck.

The mangling of urls in keys is ad-hoc and I'd rather not document that
as part of git-annex's interface, so building your own url keys is not
recommended.

I could see adding a size value to git-annex registerurl, and
I think you'd also want git-annex fromkey to have that too so you can
add the keys to the working tree.
