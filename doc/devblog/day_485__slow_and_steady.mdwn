I've been recovering from some stuff over the past month, so
progress lately has been slow, but still steadily progressing. Yesterday's
release of git-annex had a month and a half of improvements, including JSON
enhancements, adding extension support to the external special remote
protocol, and making fsck warn about required content that's missing.

Today I've been working on `git annex export` to rsync special remotes.
