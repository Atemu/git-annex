Not seen an announcement for that version, but cabal install fails currently on my machine with the following:

    Assistant/WebApp/Configurators/Local.hs:55:11:
        `fieldEnctype' is not a (visible) field of constructor `Field'
    cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
    git-annex-3.20130105 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
    ExitFailure 1
