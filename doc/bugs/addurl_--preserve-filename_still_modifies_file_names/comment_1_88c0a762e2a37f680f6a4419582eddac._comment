It certianly should not be mangling the filenames inside the torrent
directory, eg replacing space with underscore. I have fixed that now.

As to the name of the directory used by the torrent file, the interface
with remotes does not currently let the remote provide it, and would
need to be changed, which would also involve changing the external
special remote protocol.

Hmm, I suppose if the remote returns a set of files all within a single
subdirectory, it could use that subdirectory instead of the mangled url as
the containing subdirectory. Then the bittorrent remote could just add
the name as a prefix to the list of files in the torrent. (Or rather,
stop removing the name prefix, which is what it actually does currently..)

Then any external remotes that support CHECKURL and return multiple files all
inside the same single subdirectory would change behavior with and without
--preserve-filename. Without it, the single directory would be removed,
and the files in it put inside the mangled url subdirectory. 
With it, the single directory would be used without the containing 
subdirectory. The behavior change without --preserve-filename is the
possibly concerning one. Unfortunately I don't think this approach is a
safe one because something might rely on the current behavior.

I am not keen on complicating the remote interface, and especially the
external special remote protocol with something that only supports
this special case.
