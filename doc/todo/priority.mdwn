This tag is for high priority todo items.

During the current crisis, please only add things that are either needed
by scientists using git-annex (for any reason), or by organizations working
on the crisis.

Note that several [[projects]] use git-annex for science and items tagged
belonging to those projects will be prioritized so do not generally need to
be listed here.
