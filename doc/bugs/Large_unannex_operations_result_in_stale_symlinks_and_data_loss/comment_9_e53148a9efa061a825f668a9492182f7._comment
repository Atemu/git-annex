I'll chime in and say that the non-fast behavior being the default seems wrong, and making hard-link invisibly seems wrong.  What Joey proposed -- copying a file if there are multiple hard-links -- seems like the right solution.

Just recently I tried to unannex a large repository and was bitten by now-dangling symlinks to files that I couldn't locate anymore.  The fact is that the current unannex operation is too dangerous to be useful.
