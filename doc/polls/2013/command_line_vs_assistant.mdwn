To start off the 2013 git-annex user survey, let's see how many users
type `git annex` commands at the command line, and how many use the
[[/assistant]] (and its webapp).

[[!poll open=yes 0 "I use mostly the git-annex assistant" 1 "I use mostly git-annex at the command line" 0 "I use both equally often" 0 "I do not yet use git-annex"]]
