Thanks for the link, that perhaps explains the continuing oddities I've seen with google talk and presence information sometimes not being sent.

It's not clear to me if git-annex could use this extension at all. It seems to say that if I use it, my regular presence messages won't be sent. Which is a problem, since git-annex uses extended content in presence messages to indicate that they're coming from a git-annex client, which is important to make xmpp pairing work. (It's also used to send push notifications, but that's not essential.)

Also, of course, I'm reluctant to implement a non-standard extension that may change at any time, especially when it's attached to a service that currently has the FSF unhappy <http://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/google-backslides-on-federated-instant-messaging-on-purpose>.

Perhaps the real solution is to make the assistant encourage use of some other XMPP server.
