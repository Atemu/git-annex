The repodata under https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/rpms/repodata/ is outdated (from September), latest RPM in https://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/linux/current/rpms/ is from November. I (think) I had an issue using git-annex-shell using the 201909 version, so this is somewhat relevant.
