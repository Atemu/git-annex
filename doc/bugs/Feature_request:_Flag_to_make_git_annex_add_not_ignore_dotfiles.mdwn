When using git annex as part of an automated backup system, it's sometimes important that we archive all files, including dotfiles.

AFAICT there's no way to tell git annex add to add all dotfiles in a given directory; the only way to do it is to list every dotfile individually.  (git annex add --force doesn't seem to do it.)

This can be worked around with find and xargs, but this is more work than it should be, I think.

It might also be nice if git annex add displayed a warning when adding a directory with dotfiles; something like "Warning, N files ignored; pass --whatever to add them."
