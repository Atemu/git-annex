# NAME

git-annex unregisterurl - unregisters an url for a key

# SYNOPSIS

git annex unregisterurl `[key url]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command can be used to unregister urls when keys can
no longer be downloaded from them.

Unregistering a key's last url will make git-annex no longer treat content
as being present in the web special remote.

# OPTIONS

* `--batch`

  In batch input mode, lines are read from stdin, and each line
  should contain a key and url, separated by a single space.

* `-z`

   When in batch mode, the input is delimited by nulls instead of the usual
   newlines.
