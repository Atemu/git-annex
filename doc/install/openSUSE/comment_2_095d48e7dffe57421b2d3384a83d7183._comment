Confirm getting the following error on runnning zypper in git-annex:

    Loading repository data...
    Reading installed packages...
    Package 'git-annex' not found.

Looking at [software.opensuse](https://software.opensuse.org/package/git-annex) I found at least an experimental package, which seems to work for me:

    zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:languages:haskell/openSUSE_Leap_15.2/devel:languages:haskell.repo
    zypper refresh
    zypper install git-annex
