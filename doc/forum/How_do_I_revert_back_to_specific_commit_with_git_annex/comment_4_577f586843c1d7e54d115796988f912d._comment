Thanks for the detailed answer.

So the only way to revert metadata changes is to reset the git-annex branch to a previous commit with `git update-ref refs/heads/git-annex <commit>`. 

Thanks for the `git-log --stat` tip.

I guess I could get an approximate match between the master and git-annex branches commits based on commit date.
