### Please describe the problem.

I had set up git-annex on a mac; I had created an initial repository at ~/annex; I had created a second repository on an external drive, at /Volumes/Biblio/annex; I had paired with three other machines on the same network, (two linux, one other mac) and set up a remote server as a backup-type repository. All seemed well. It had finally finished syncing everything to the remote server (my upload speeds are slow).

I closed the firefox window showing the dashboard. I wanted to reopen it, so I ran the git-annex.app again, presuming on a running instance that that just opens the browser back at the webapp. Firefox window opened, but the only repository was the second one I'd made on the external drive.

I restarted, as best as I could work out: git-annex assistant --stop, then because that left behind a process, killall git-annex. Then restarted the app.

Firefox opened on the webapp. I had two repositories: The one on the external drive (now the "Here" repo) and the one on ~/annex but only as if it was paired from a different machine.

ie: I see only "celestia.local (rachel@celestia.local~/annex)". This machine *is* celestia.local.

That's it. Startup scan took a couple of minutes but didn't add anything. Then it decided to sync to celestia.local, which it took a little time over but didn't apparently do anything.

If I drop files into ~/annex they are not synced anywhere. ~/annex still has a .git directory, populated with git files, it looks intact. It's just not being seen.

Is it possible because the user is prompted to create their initial repo at ~/Desktop/annex it will by default only look there, then start looking in external drives for it? So the fact I didn't want it on my desktop, but put it directly in home, meant it got lost on restart?

git-annex vicfg in ~/annex shows me this:

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

As above. I have no idea what just happened, but apart from git-annex assistant --stop and having to mop up leftover processes, I didn't use the git-annex commandline for anything.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Mac OS X 10.8.4

    Version: 4.20130909-ga29f960
    Build flags: Assistant Webapp Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV FsEvents XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi 

### Please provide any additional information below.

The log on ~/annex/.git/annex/daemon.log is huge and full of transfers of files with my personal filenames. I'd rather not. It appears to end normally.

Now there is a short log in /Volumes/Biblio/annex/.git/annex/daemon.log from, I guess, the time I tried to restart. For some reason therefore, after the successful session finished, on restart it only looks here. This log is appended.

Well, I see that thing about "failed to lock". I can imagine that my 'killall git-annex' to kill a leftover process that was hanging around after I'd done git-annex assistant --stop might have left stale lock files, somewhere... but of course I only got as far as doing that because I was already encountering problems, just trying to return to the webapp.
