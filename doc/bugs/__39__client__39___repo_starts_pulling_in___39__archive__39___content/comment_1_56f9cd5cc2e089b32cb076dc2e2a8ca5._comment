I've added some debug info to the log for transfers and drops. You have to start the assistant with the --debug flag, then you'll get stuff like:

<pre>
[2013-03-01 15:23:10 JEST] Committer: queued Upload UUID \"a0cd7cb6-57ee-4551-955f-aa77738135cc\" myfile : newly added file
[2013-03-01 15:25:00 JEST] Watcher: queued Download UUID \"a0cd7cb6-57ee-4551-955f-aa77738135cc\" ./foo : new or renamed file wanted
[2013-03-01 15:54:00 JEST] Watcher: dropped ./archive/foo (from: here) (copies now: 1): file renamed
</pre>

It would take more work to show the preferred content expressions that caused the transfer or drop, but this is simple to determine:

* for Uploads it should always be the preferred content expression of the remote being uploaded to
* for Downloads it is always the preferred content expression of the local repository
* for drops it is always the preferred content expression of the repository it is dropped from

Have not managed to reproduce problem yet.
