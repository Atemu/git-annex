It seems that this has something to do with an auto `git gc` run being trigged somehow during the repair. Puzzlingly, I cannot find any code that would delete the .git/gc.pid file, unless it somehow shows up as a branch ref or something like that.

Can you run the command with --debug so we can see which particular git command triggered the git gc?
