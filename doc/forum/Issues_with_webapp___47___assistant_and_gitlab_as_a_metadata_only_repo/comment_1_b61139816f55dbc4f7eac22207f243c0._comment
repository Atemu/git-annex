So, sometimes (often), it says it synched in the webapp, but no changes show up in any branch on gitlab.  However, sometimes it works.  For example, sometimes after killing everything off (including any ssh sessions) and restarting the webapp, a file I added to the repo locally as a test will show up in the gitlab repo.  When I then move that file, the webapp/assistant wakes up, syncs (says it was successful), and the \"delete\" is processed in the gitlab repo (the old file is deleted), but the \"add\" (the file showing up with a new name) doesn't.
