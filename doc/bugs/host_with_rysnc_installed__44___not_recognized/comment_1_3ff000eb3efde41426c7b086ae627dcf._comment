The git-annex webapp runs some shell commands on the remote it's setting up, in this case the FreeNAS box. It's difficult to do this entirely portably. I have tried to use only POSIX shell compatable commands, that should also work with embedded systems using busybox.

You can try running the probe yourself at the prompt on the FreeNAS and see how it fails. The command run is:

     echo loggedin;if which git-annex-shell; then echo git-annex-shell; fi;if which rsync; then echo rsync; fi
