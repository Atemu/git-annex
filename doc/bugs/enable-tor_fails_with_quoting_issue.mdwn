### Please describe the problem.

git annex enable-tor fails with an error in the KDE su dialog window:

    Cannot execute command ' ''\''/home/adam/software/scm/git-annex.static/git-annex'\'' '\''enable-tor'\'' '\''1000'\''''.

The console shows the following:

```
enable-tor
  You may be prompted for a password
org.kde.kdesud: priority set to  50
org.kde.kdesud: Scheduler set to  0

git-annex: Failed to run as root: /home/adam/software/scm/git-annex.static/git-annex enable-tor 1000
failed
git-annex: enable-tor: 1 failed
```

Interestingly this happens on my openSUSE Tumbleweed system running XFCE4 (*not* KDE), but not on the peer I'm trying to pair with, which is an older openSUSE Leap 15.0 box.  On the latter, for some reason that uses `gksu`, even though both systems are running XFCE4:

```
enable-tor
  You may be prompted for a password
gksu-run: gksu/'|home|adam|software|scm|git-annex.static|git-annex' 'enable-tor' '1000'/9140-0-pacific_TIME0
gksu-run: e680f4b50a49c297709613029db91b7a

  Tor hidden service is configured. Checking connection to it. This may take a few minutes.

  Tor hidden service is working.
ok
```

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Simply run `git-annex enable-tor`

### Workaround

I found that a valid workaround is to `su` to `root`, `cd` to the same repo, and run `git annex enable-tor 1000`.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

The identical statically compiled 7.20190912-g05bc37910 is running on both the failing Tumbleweed system and the succeeding Leap 15.0 system.

### Please provide any additional information below.

Here is the relevant fragment of the process tree:

```
  |   |-zsh,9829
  |   |   |-git,21554 annex enable-tor
  |   |   |   `-git-annex,21555 --library-path /home/adam/software/scm/git-annex.static//usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gconv:/home/adam/software/scm/git-annex.static//usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/audit>
  |   |   |       |-kdesu,21584 '/home/adam/software/scm/git-annex.static/git-annex' 'enable-tor' '1000'
  |   |   |       |   |-{kdesu},21585
  |   |   |       |   |-{kdesu},21586
  |   |   |       |   |-{kdesu},21588
  |   |   |       |   |-{kdesu},21589
  |   |   |       |   |-{kdesu},21591
  |   |   |       |   `-{kdesu},21595
  |   |   |       |-{git-annex},21579
  |   |   |       |-{git-annex},21580
  |   |   |       |-{git-annex},21581
  |   |   |       `-{git-annex},21583
```

You can clearly see that the arguments to `kdesu` have extra quotes, which I'm guessing is part of the problem:

```
$ xxd /proc/21584/cmdline
00000000: 6b64 6573 7500 272f 686f 6d65 2f61 6461  kdesu.'/home/ada

```

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, lots and lots for many years :-)
