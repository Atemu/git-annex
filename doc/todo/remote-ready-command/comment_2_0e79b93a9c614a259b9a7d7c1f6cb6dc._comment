> I wonder, what about downloads from the remote, those could also overload some remote.

That is a good point, but it's not needed for my use case; KBFS hasn't had any trouble so far keeping up with reading data, only with writing.

> Is your KBFS remote an external special remote, or are you just using a directory special remote on that filesystem? If it were an external special remote, you could just make it delay until ready when it receives a TRANSFER request.

I originally had a directory special remote pointing to the FUSE-mounted KBFS, but I was having some issues with that, so I switched to an rsync special remote (also pointing to FUSE-mounted KBFS).

Awesome, looks like either of those would be better workarounds than I have right now.  Thanks!
