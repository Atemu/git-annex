I had the same problem, also with Android 4.1.1 (an Asus TF201). This is what I did:

- Download version for Android 4.2 to 4.4 and install that one over the previous.
- Access the server (and thus, get the keys generated, etc).
- Reinstall the version for Android 4.1

And things seem to be working.
