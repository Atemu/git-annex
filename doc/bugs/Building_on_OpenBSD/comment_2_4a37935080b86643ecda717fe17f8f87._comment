Sorry for the long delay, but I've tried what you said:
``% cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin --flags=\"-pairing -webdav\" -j2``

and it STILL fails with:
``cabal: user error (Error: some packages failed to install:
git-annex-5.20140129 depends on network-info-0.2.0.3 which failed to install.
network-info-0.2.0.3 failed during the building phase. The exception was:
ExitFailure 1
uuid-1.3.3 depends on network-info-0.2.0.3 which failed to install.
)``
