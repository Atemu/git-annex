Dug a little into implementing this.

One problem is that things like `git annex dead` look up a name
in the remote list, and then use the uuid of the returned remote. 
But if remote foo has sameas=bar-uuid, then the remote in the remote
list that it looks up will have that uuid, and so the uuid that will
be marked as dead is almost certianly not the one that the user expected.

And the user can't pass the masked uuid of the sameas remote to `git-annex
dead`, because there will be no remote in the list with that uuid.

And for that matter, the user is not likely to know the masked uuid,
because things like `git annex info` won't display it..

Another gotcha is that the user might make remote B with sameas=A-uuid,
and remote C with sameas=B-uuid. Which really needs to resolve to A-uuid,
so it needs to do multiple lookups, but then a sameas loop becomes a problem.
