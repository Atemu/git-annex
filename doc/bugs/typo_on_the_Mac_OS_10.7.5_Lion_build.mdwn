As told in http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/OSX_app_issues/#comment-2a69d531bd3bb593c1a49dc8cdb34b1e the Mac OS 10.7.5 (Lion) build fails to run.

    $ /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/git-annex

    /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell: line 25: syntax error near unexpected token `&'

Manually editing /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/runshell as told in http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/OSX_app_issues/#comment-5579c2150ad4d2ccc207a253fe57612a fixes the issue.

Furthermore, this build is quite outdated...
