I wanted to use it as a way to prepare the files before running `git annex add`. I like to have everything exactly how I want it before I add anything to git, or git-annex. Does git-annex do anything in the git-annex branch prior to running the pre-commit hook? I.e. is there any penalty, however slight, in running `git annex add` several times while moving stuff around?
