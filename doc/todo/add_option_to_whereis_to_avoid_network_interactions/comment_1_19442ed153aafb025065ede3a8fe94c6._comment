This is not specific to whereis at all. You have added a new git remote and
git-annex does not know what the uuid of it is. Until it can find out, it
won't be able to use that remote (including referring to it in whereis
output). So, git-annex always tries to get the uuid for such remotes
at startup time.

If you don't want git-annex to use this remote, you can set
remote.name.annex-ignore.
