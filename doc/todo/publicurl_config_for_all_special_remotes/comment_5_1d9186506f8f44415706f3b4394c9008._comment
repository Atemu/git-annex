[[generic_readonly_http_remote]] if implemented would accomplish the same
thing as this todo.

The advantage to that idea is, it doesn't need modifications be made to every
special remote that might end up exposed over http. As long as the special
remote is not *too* special about how it mangles keys into paths, it
can work for a lot of special remotes.

The directory special remote is a good example.. It would be weird for that to
have http-specific configuration and complications.

And, that approach doesn't complicate the external special remote protocol,
and avoids the problems discussed in comment #4.

So, I'm inclined to that approach over this one.
