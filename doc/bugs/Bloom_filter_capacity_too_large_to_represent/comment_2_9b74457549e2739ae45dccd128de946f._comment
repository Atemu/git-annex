However, in Greg's case he had no such configuration. Instead, I think something is broken with the use of floating point or bit math that bloomfilter uses, on the NAS where he's using git-annex.

I have made git-annex not crash when this happens, just show a warning and fall back to a reasonable default bloom filter size. If the problem is with the bit math, then the bloom filter may not work either, which would probably show up as false negatives, so `git annex unused` not finding things that are unused. 

I need to update the armel build with this so Greg can test it..
