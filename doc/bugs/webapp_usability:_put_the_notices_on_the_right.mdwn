### Please describe the problem.

The colored notices on the left of the screen are a little off. When they disappear, it also leaves a huge gap on the left side.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Click the `X` on all the messages on the left.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

4.20130815~bpo70+1 on Debian Wheezy, with Chromium Version 29.0.1547.57 Debian 7.1 (217859)

### Please provide any additional information below.

This is admittedly a very mild problem, but from a usability perspective, it would be less confusing to show those on the right. When they were gone, I thought git-annex was broken somewhat...
