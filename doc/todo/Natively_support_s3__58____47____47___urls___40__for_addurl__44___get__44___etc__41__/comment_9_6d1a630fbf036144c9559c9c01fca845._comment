@joey If I understand correctly, addurl requires a standard URL downloadable by curl?   Would it be possible to add 'adduri' and 'registeruri' counterparts, that would be exactly like addurl/registerurl, except they would be for custom URIs not expected to be fetchable by curl?   There seems to be an odd asymmetry, where the external special remote protocol has SETURIPRESENT/SETURLPRESENT, but the command-line only has the URL versions.
