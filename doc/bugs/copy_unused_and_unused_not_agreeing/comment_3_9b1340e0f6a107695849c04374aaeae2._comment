heh, I *just* dist-upgraded this morning on the box that was showing the problem from git-annex_5.20140127_amd64.deb to git-annex_5.20140210_amd64.deb. So what you say is probably right (re unused.log).

The only other annex I have in direct mode right now is one that I also am using the standalone build with (version 5.20131224-g6ca5271 right now). It has unused content in it (in fact, it's the synology annex, where I'm moving all the unused data to). I can do testing there if needed (and since it's a standalone build, it's easy for me to switch around git-annex versions with symlinks). The only problem is that it is dog slow when running git-annex unused. :)
