Sorry for leaving such a bad bug unaddressed so long. (And in fact a
reversion since it used to work fine and I broke it about a month before
this bug was opened.)

It's fixed now.

Bear in mind that I have a backlog that is literally
over 400 items long and just can't get to everything promptly. 
Unsure why I didn't notice one of the several followups in my 
triage operations, other than the assistant being a ways down
my prority list and bug reports about it often being not detailed enough
and taking a lot of time to understand. If anyone would like to help
triage out important problems like this one that I may be missing,
that would be great.
