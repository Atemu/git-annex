[Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage)
supports the same API as Amazon S3, so the
[[S3 special remote|special_remotes/S3]] can be used with it.
Here is a configuration example:

	git annex initremote cloud type=S3 encryption=none host=storage.googleapis.com port=80

Thanks to jterrance for the [original tip](https://gist.github.com/4576324).

There is also an external special remote that accesses Google Cloud Storage
via a Google Cloud service account, and does not rely on the Google Cloud
Storage Interoperability API. <https://github.com/bgilbert/gcsannex> has
features including support for Nearline storage.
