Here's the screen capture : [http://i.imgur.com/owmuIKa.png](http://i.imgur.com/owmuIKa.png)

I used the menu item to open the WebApp. Nothing appeared in the git-annex's terminal window when I opened the WebApp. The error message is the one that appears when I start Git Annex.

The WebApp seems to be working. It synced a picture I took when the WebApp was already running. See : [http://i.imgur.com/Bcu4iAE.png](http://i.imgur.com/Bcu4iAE.png)

I think I have this bug since the Android version is out. I thought maybe it was normal in the beginning.

Here's the log :
