Thanks!

I do see some failures during concurrent usage, with the error message

fatal: Unable to create '/data/ilya-work/benchmarks/viral-ngs-benchmarks/.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.

It seems that git does not have a built-in wait for the index lock to be released:

Maybe, for greater robustness, git-annex could add a wait for this, when it calls git.
