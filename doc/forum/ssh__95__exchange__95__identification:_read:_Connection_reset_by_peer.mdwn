I setup a local git annex repo and tried to pair it with an empty repo on my notebook. All done via the webapp.

But pairing failed somehow, because I get this error while transfer seems to go on forever.

    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

I can access the other computer via ssh. 

juh
