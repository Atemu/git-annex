The assistant doesn't seem to be noticing renames or fixing files anymore, for me; that was what got me started on this bug report, though it sounds like I took it in an irrelevant direction by focusing on the command line and \"git annex fix.\"

I'll double check, and submit a new bug report if I can confirm that assistant isn't doing what it should.
