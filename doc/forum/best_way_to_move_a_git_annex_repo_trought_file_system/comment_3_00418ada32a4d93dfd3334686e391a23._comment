Yeah, this is not really a problem. Do note that, when a git-annex repo is
moved to a new drive, this does change some of the internal details that
git-annex keeps track of (inode numbers). If the repository has unlocked
files in it, this can make git-annex's handling of those a little slow at
first, until it learns the new details.
