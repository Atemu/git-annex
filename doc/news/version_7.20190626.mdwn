git-annex 7.20190626 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]

   * get, move, copy, sync: When -J or annex.jobs has enabled concurrency,
     checksum verification uses a separate job pool than is used for
     downloads, to keep bandwidth saturated.
   * Other commands also run their cleanup phase using a separate job pool
     than their perform phase, which may make some of them somewhat faster
     when running concurrently as well.
   * When downloading an url and the destination file exists but is empty,
     avoid using http range to resume, since a range "bytes=0-" is an unusual
     edge case that it's best to avoid relying on working. This is known to
     fix a case where importfeed downloaded a partial feed from such a server.
   * importfeed: When there's a problem parsing the feed, --debug will
     output the feed content that was downloaded.
   * init: Fix a reversion in the last release that prevented automatically
     generating and setting a description for the repository.
   * add: Display progress meter when hashing files.
   * add: Support --json-progress option.
   * The Linux standalone arm build now works again on CPU versions below
     arm6. Thanks to Emanuele Olivetti, Ilias Tsitsimpis, Bernhard
     Ãœbelacker, and Adrian Bunk for fixing ghc in Debian (bug #928882).
   * OSX dmg: Put git-annex's version in the Info.plist file."""]]
