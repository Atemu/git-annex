I had started a fresh repo to test out the watch command again on OSX and noticed that it's borked, I'm not sure when it was broken.

The snippet of the log message and command is

<pre>
$ git annex watch --foreground -d -v
watch . read: git ["--git-dir=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest/.git","--work-tree=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest","show-ref","git-annex"] 
read: git ["--git-dir=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest/.git","--work-tree=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest","show-ref","--hash","refs/heads/git-annex"] 
read: git ["--git-dir=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest/.git","--work-tree=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest","log","refs/heads/git-annex..6702e5361146450800ae5af0b63e97bd9c55d70b","--oneline","-n1"] 
chat: git ["--git-dir=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest/.git","--work-tree=/Users/jtang/sandbox/atest","cat-file","--batch"] 
(scanning...) call: git ["--git-dir=/Users/jtan
</pre>

I had run git-annex with a new repo with just doing a git init and git annex init, I just threw in one or two small text files to see if it was working. It just hangs and does nothing. I had also tried it out on one of my bigger repos and it does the same thing it just hangs at _(scanning...)_ There isn't much to go on, I wonder if it's hitting the [[Issue on OSX with some system limits]] or if its just a thread/fork issue on OSX.
