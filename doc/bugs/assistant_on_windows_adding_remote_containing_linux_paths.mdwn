### Please describe the problem.

Internal Server Error

internal error, /home/michele/assistannex is not absolute

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

create a transfer repository on a usb drive (from windows) merge it with a
repository on linux, try to merge it on another target windows machine

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version 5.20140128-g29aea74
