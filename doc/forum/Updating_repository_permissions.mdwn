Hello everyone,

I would like to make a repository readable and writable over ssh for all users of a given group.

A [quick search](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29646155) led me to the following procedure :

```bash
cd <project_dir>/                         # Enter inside the project directory
git config core.sharedRepository group    # Update the git's config
chgrp -R <group-name> .                   # Change files and directories' group
chmod -R g+w .                            # Change permissions
chmod g-w .git/objects/pack/*             # Git pack files should be immutable
find -type d -exec chmod g+s {} +         # New files get directory's group id
```

My question is simple : is it safe to apply it to a git-annex repository as well ?

Thank you for your help.
