What steps will reproduce the problem?

I create a new annex, added in a bunch of files.

I cloned this annex to another machine, where I already had those files, so I copied them into a directory named "foo", did "git annex add foo", and then did "git rm -r foo", and git commit'd my clone of the annex.

Then I try to "git annex sync" with the remote.

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I don't know, I've never used git-annex before.  This is what I get each time:

    Hermes ~/Products/tmp/Movies (master) $ ga sync
    git-annex-shell: Prelude.(!!): index too large

What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

It's the 'master' as of yesterday: c504f4025fec49e62601fbd4a3cd8f1270c7d221

I'm on OS X 10.8.2, using GHC 7.6.1.  The annex in question has 38G in a few hundred files.

Please provide any additional information below.

I'm willing to help track this down!
