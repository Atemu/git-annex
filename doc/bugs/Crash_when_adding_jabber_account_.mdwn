*What steps will reproduce the problem?*

1. Start git-annex webapp
2. Configuration
3. Configure Jabber Account
4. Insert user and pass
5. Click "User this account"

Tryed 4 times, all the same.


*What is the expected output? What do you see instead?*

On Chrome I get "Error 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET): The connection was reset." or "Error 324 (net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE): The server closed the connection without sending any data."

On the terminal where git-annex was running I get "Segmentation fault (core dumped)"


*What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?*

git-annex version: I downloaded 3.20130107 (twice to be sure), but for some reason 'git-annex version' reports 3.20130102 

OS: Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS 3.2.0-35-generic-pae #55-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 5 18:04:39 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
