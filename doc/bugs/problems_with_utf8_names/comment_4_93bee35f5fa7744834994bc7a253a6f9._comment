Adam, this bug was fixed a long time ago, first using option #2 above, but later switching to option #3 -- git-annex treats filenames as opaque binary blobs and never decodes them in any encoding; haskell's normal encoding support for stdio is disabled. 

And it never resulted in a failure like you show. I cannot reproduce your problem, but it is a different bug, please open a new bug report.
