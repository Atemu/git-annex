git-annex uses FilePath (String) extensively. That's a slow data type.
Converting to ByteString, and RawFilePath, should speed it up
significantly, according to [[/profiling]].

I've made a test branch, `bs`, to see what kind of performance improvement
to expect. 

Benchmarking `git-annex find`, speedups range from 28-66%. The files fly by
much more snappily. Other commands likely also speed up, but do more work
than find so the improvement is not as large.

The `bs` branch is in a mergeable state now, except for:

* filepath-bytestring probably has issues with utf16 filenames
  on Windows. See its TODO.

Stuff not entirely finished:

* Profile various commands and look for hot spots involving conversion
  between RawFilePath and FilePath.
