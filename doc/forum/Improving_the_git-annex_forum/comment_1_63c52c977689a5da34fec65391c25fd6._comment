Thanks, Florian for raising this topic.

Granting the missing features you list (and perhaps adding that people seem
to sometimes find it annoying to log in successfully here), I wonder how
much those features are limiting use of this forum, if at all. I suppose
one way to find out would be to move to another forum and see if traffic
increases (or SNR or engagement improves).

For myself, having the forum integrated in the git-annex repo is quite
helpful to me, since I automatically track it along with all the other
changes to the website, and am sure to see every single post here,
and it meets my offline/low bandwidth needs. Also I sometimes promote
forum posts to bug reports or make a commit following up to a forum
post with a requested feature or fix.

I suspect that the git-annex community is kind of split between people who
are more comfortable in web forums, and people who are used to mailing
lists, who are currently being left entirely out in the cold (and probably
using the irc channel more). It could be that mailman3 with its mix of
forum and mailing list could better unify the two groups. Or perhaps
there's no point in trying to do that, and a simple mailing list would be a
bigger win than changing the forum?

I'm ok with however git-annex users choose to get together and
talk about it, including ways that I can't/won't use myself (including
non-free stuff like Slack..). To that end, if people want to get a
git-annex community going somewhere, be it another forum, or reddit, or
whatever, I'm fine with the website directing users to it.
