I try to understand how to setup git-annex for the following use case:

Two computers, that are paired via remote sharing, using some cloud repository for transfer, and a local NAS for backups.

These two computers are sometimes in the same network, sometimes in different networks, and sometimes even without network at all. From what I read, it should be possible to bypass the cloud when these two machines are on the same network, which sounds great.

Would it be possible to use a portable drive as \"another link\" between these two computers that can be used to sync them even if there is no network between them?

And as you write, if the pairing has been set up manually, then everything is fine - so could it be that it is really easy and only necessary to setup the git-annex on the local drive as an additional remote on both (or only one?) machine?

thanks for any insight!
