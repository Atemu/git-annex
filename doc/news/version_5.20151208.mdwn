git-annex 5.20151208 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Build with -j1 again to get reproducible build.
   * Display progress meter in -J mode when copying from a local git repo,
     to a local git repo, and from a remote git repo.
   * Display progress meter in -J mode when downloading from the web.
   * map: Improve display of git remotes with non-ssh urls, including http
     and gcrypt.
   * When core.sharedRepository is set, annex object files are not made mode
     444, since that prevents a user other than the file owner from locking
     them. Instead, a mode such as 664 is used in this case.
   * tahoe: Include tahoe capabilities in whereis display.
   * import: Changed to honor annex.largefiles settings.
   * addurl, importfeed: Changed to honor annex.largefiles settings,
     when the content of the url is downloaded. (Not when using --fast or
     --relaxed.)
   * webapp: Fix bugs that could result in a relative path such as "."
     being written to ~/.config/git-annex/autostart, and ignore any such
     relative paths in the file.
     This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
   * dropunused: Make more robust when trying to drop an object that has
     already been dropped.
   * Fix reversion in handling of long filenames, particularly when using
     addurl/importfeed, which was introduced in the previous release."""]]
