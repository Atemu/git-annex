I have no idea where this large number of commits come from, but maybe the sheer number of files explains it:

Files appearing in the wrong place (probably due to me starting the assistant in a subdirectory of the repo):

    $ git log --stat | grep \"5d/20.*+$\" |wc -l
    1148

Me wondering where they come from and deleting them manually step by step when I found them:

    $ git log --stat | grep \"5d/20.*-$\" |wc -l
    1095

git-annex removing the original files that have been mirrored in the wrong place (and maybe a few more as I was working on stuff there as well):

    $ git log --stat | grep \"^ 20.*-$\" | wc -l
    1152

Maybe this explains the large number (approx. 500) of commits?

The missing 200 files have not been in a different repo, so apart from 3 that were not available they have been restored from the backup.

As my setup needs some changes anyway I'm going to start from scratch.
