Thanks for your reply, Joey. I hadn't caught that it was an open todo, which of course explains it.

This is the missing piece of the puzzle in a valued workflow of mine. After being constantly amazed by what git-annex enables me to do, it's about time I head over to Patreon to help see it realized (in due time, of course).
