we just shrinked the bundle by 60MB so there could be some space for sshd.

adb might indeed be more powerful but would require usb connection (right?) -- at times not convenient

syncing via ssh from phone: that is what I was trying to avoid -- working in the shell on the phone -- it is possible but a bit \"inconvenient\"
sshd could be ran on any unprivileged port while letting the user who starts it know the IP and the port, thus making it easy to connect.
