I did it just then:

    fsck git-annex_4.20130627_amd64.deb (checksum...) [2013-07-11 13:38:46 BST] read: sha256sum [\"git-annex_4.20130627_amd64.deb\"]
    
      Bad file content; left in place for you to examine
    failed

however, more concerningly, this happened to almost all the files in the repo:

    git-annex: fsck: 79 failed

and they do seem to be a different size between the two computers.
