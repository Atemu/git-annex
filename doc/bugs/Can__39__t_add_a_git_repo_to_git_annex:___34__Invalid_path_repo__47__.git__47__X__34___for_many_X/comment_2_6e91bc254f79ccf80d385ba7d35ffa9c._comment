Be that as it may, the whole reason git-annex exists is to work around fundamental limitations of git!

The issue is that I don't want to treat a folder which I happen to have applied version control to differently than a folder which happens not to be version controlled (aside from committing to the version-controlled folder, of course!).  Both folders are in my git annex; I shouldn't have to worry about it.  (My whole \"documents\" folder is in git annex, and it contains many small git repositories.)

I guess I could write a script to unbundle and re-bundle on command.  In fact, one could imagine integrating these scripts into git annex somehow.

Is that something you'd consider taking upstream?
