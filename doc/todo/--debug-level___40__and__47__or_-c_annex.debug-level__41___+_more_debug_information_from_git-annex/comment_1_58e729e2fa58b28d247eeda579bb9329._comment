Every call to debugM does add overhead both in time to run it
(checking if debugging is enabled is nonzero overhead and this will add up
if it's done a few million times or whatever) and in time to write
a useful explanation.

It seems to me that debugging is best added when trying to debug something,
or when there's a readily available value that can be output (such as the
safety proof that is debugged when dropping, or external special remote
messages).

Trying to add enough useful debugging information to 60,000 lines of code
that any possible thing it might do will have a useful debug trace seems
like a recipe to end up with 100,000 lines of code. It would be easier to
run the code in a debugger and step through it at that point.
