# NAME

git-annex add - adds files to the git annex

# SYNOPSIS

git annex add `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Adds files in the path to the annex. If no path is specified, adds
files from the current directory and below.

Normally, files that are already checked into git, or that git has been
configured to ignore will be silently skipped.

# OPTIONS

* `--include-dotfiles`

  Dotfiles are skipped unless explicitly listed, or unless this option is
  used.

* `--force`

  Add gitignored files.

* `--backend`

  Specifies which key-value backend to use.

* file matching options

  Many of the [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to add.

  For example: `--largerthan=1GB`
