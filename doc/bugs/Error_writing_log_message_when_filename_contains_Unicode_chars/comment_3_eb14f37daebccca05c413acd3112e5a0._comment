I've developed a patch to hinotify that fixes the problem. Hopefully it will
be accepted upstream soon. (Update: It's merged and will be in the next
release of hinotify.) Verified that with it, the assistant can add
these files even when run in LANG=C.

The debug logger still shows the error message, but it's not actually fatal,
and I'm inclined to not do anything about it since it only shows up when
debugging is enabled. Actually, I'm not sure what to do about it; it's
writing to stderr, which has fileEncoding set on it, so I don't understand
why it's having the problem -- when git-annex writes filenames to stderr it
works ok, but when System.Log.Handler.Simple does, it fails like this
weird.
