I am running into this problem right now. I exported a movie collection from laptop A and then a huge collection of photos from laptop B to an USB drive. Both exports ran many hours.
Now when I want to export the next collection of files, I see:

> git annex export master --to usb-sg2
>
>  Resolving export conflict..
>
> unexport usb-sg2 path/to/some/picture/file.jpg ok

Do you already have a solution for this in mind? Could I speed up the implementation with sponsorship? This is a hard blocker now for me in my consolidation of our data with git-annex. I would rather not spend many nights to keep exporting and unexporting the same files over and over.

Maybe I could hack this as a temporary workaround by manually changing the exported trees in the exports.log file? The \"conflicting\" exports are in two separate sub-trees.
