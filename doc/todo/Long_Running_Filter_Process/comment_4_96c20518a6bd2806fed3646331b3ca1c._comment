While `git add` would be a lot slower when using this interface to add
large files, it would make `git checkout` and other commands that update
the work tree a lot faster.

Since the smudge filter is not providing git with the file content any more,
using filterdriver would avoid git running many git-annex smudge processes,
greatly speeding up large checkouts.

Unfortunately, `git annex smudge --update` ends up running the smudge filter
on all files that the clean filter earlier acted on, so even if filterdriver were
used to speed up the clean filter, there would still be one process spawned per
file for the smudge filter.

So some interface improvement is needed before git-annex can usefully use
this.
