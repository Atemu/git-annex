\"When versioning is not enabled, this risks data loss\" -- maybe, add an option to always import before exporting?  I don't want to enable versioning since that permanently loses the chance of dropping any objects (even if they're stored elsewhere).

Also, versioning on S3 buckets can be suspended/resumed; not sure if git-annex uses current bucket versioning state or the remote configuration.
