I don't think there's a way to do that.  I think your main options are

  * set `receive.denyCurrentBranch` to \"updateInstead\" or

  * handle the pushing and fetching yourself.  Follow up with a `git
    annex merge` or with a `git annex sync` invocation that prevents
    it from pushing/pulling.

    I haven't used it myself, but my understanding is that `sync`s
    recently added `--only-annex` is intended to support this case and
    frees you from worrying about managing git-annex branches.
