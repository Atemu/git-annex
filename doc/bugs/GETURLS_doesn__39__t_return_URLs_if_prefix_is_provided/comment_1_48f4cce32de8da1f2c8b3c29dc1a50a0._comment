This seems very unlikely, because the *indentical* code path is running
in both cases. In both cases it filters the list of urls to those prefixed with
the specified prefix; when no prefix is specified it uses "" as the
prefix.

Also, when I test it myself using my own test code, it works as expected:

<pre>
[2015-03-27 13:49:30 JEST] git-annex-remote-test --> GETURLS SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855 dl+archive:
[2015-03-27 13:49:30 JEST] git-annex-remote-test <-- VALUE dl+archive:foo-bar-baz
[2015-03-27 13:49:30 JEST] git-annex-remote-test <-- VALUE 
</pre>

Are you sure that your test machinery has actually set any urls in the
second case?
