Wiped out the repository I was using.  Cleared my data on the android app completely so I was starting from scratch.  Created a new repository on the laptop with a linked XMPP account and a ssh repo.  Fired up the android app and gave it the same XMPP credentials and the same ssh repo.

I did not actually add any files to the repo.

The application consumed 35% CPU on the Android tablet, idling, and has been ever since.

This is the log; maybe something in it will explain the problem:
