By "git log", are you talking about the actual git history of the
repository?

If this repository is a clone from some other repository, then
`git annex repair` may be able to help, by repairing the git repository
damage with information from the other repository.

The git repository is where the names of files are stored, so if you manage
to completely lose that information, you're kind of out of luck.
