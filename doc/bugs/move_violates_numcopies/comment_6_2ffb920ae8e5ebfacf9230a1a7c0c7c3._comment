\"not making it worse\" sounds like acceptable middle ground to me. If you are not erroring out, at least printing a warning would be good. OTOH, this easily gets hidden in a flood of message if you're moving more than just a few files.

Still, principle of least surprise would point towards not going against basic safety measures in any case.
