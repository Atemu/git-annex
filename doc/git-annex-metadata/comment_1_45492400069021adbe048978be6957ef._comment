I want to store a simple mapping in git-annex on the git-annex branch, from string keys to values.  I figured I can just do
 git annex metadata --key=WORM-s0-m0--mykey -s myfield+=myvalue
and after git annex sync these mappings will propagate to copies of the repo.  But the keys won't point to any file in any remote.
Will that break anything in git-annex?  Will they get garbage-collected automatically in some circumstances?
