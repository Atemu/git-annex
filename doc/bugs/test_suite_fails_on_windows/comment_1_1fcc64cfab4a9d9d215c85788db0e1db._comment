Just running "git-annex add" on a file on windows is enough to reproduce
the bug.

This must be related to ghc 8.6.1's change to Windows paths that made "NUL"
not work, but git-annex has been using the device namespace workaround for
nearly a year now.

Presumably the recent upgrade of the windows autobuilder's toolchain
exposed the problem. Maybe something had a reversion?

In ghci 8.6.5, this works fine, no error:

	withFile "\\\\.\\NUL" ReadMode (\h -> print "opened NUL ok")

Need to try ghci Utility/Process.hs on windows and see if running
`withNullHandle (const noop)` works.
