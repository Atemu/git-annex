### Please describe the problem.
There appears to be no way of getting the current configuration of special remotes (e.g. url, keyid). Maybe there should be git-annex-showremote (or similar).

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Configure the special remote (e.g. webdav), and then forget what settings you specified ;)

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
7.20190129-3 (Debian)
