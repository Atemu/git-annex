I think windows has a limit of around 256 characters on the total length of
a path. (vs 4096 on linux)

So, even if ikiwiki had a way to limit the length of a page name,
which could perhaps be done with `wiki_file_regexp`, that would not help,
because several short page names can be nested into a path that ends up too
long for windows. As is the case here; neither of the bug report filenames
is too long, only the comments on them end up too long. Allowing posting a
bug report but not commenting on it would not be good.

Since I am flatly NOT going to decouple the bug tracking repo from the
source code repo, this seems to put me in the position of going around
cleaning up things that happen to be too long for windows manually. Which I
frankly, also do not want to do. I guess I'll take patches if people want
to send them, but is this really how we want to spend our time?

(Also, renaming someone's bug report out from under where it was risks them
not seeing a request for more information.)

Note that, windows provides ways to avoid these length limits, by prefixing
paths with a sequence that avoids using a compatability layer that imposes
them, and instead uses a more modern layer that has more reasonable limits.
I think git-annex actually uses that itself, thanks to some improvements to
ghc. git for windows could be made to also, I suppose.
