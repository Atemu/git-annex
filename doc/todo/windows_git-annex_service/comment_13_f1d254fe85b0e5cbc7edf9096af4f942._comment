I have messed with the windows ACLs some yesterday, but I don't know how or if it's possible to set ACLs on a directory, such that everything created inside it will be writable by two different users. Certainly this is doable on POSIX; if it's doable on Windows, I'll revisit services.

For now, it seems that a better option may be to not run git-annex as a service, but use various dos-window hiding technologies.

<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21031171/how-to-run-a-command-on-the-background-on-windows/21031281#21031281>

I have successfully gotten this to work using nircmd. make a git-annex-webapp.bat, containing:

<pre>
title GitAnnex
nircmd.exe win hide ititle \"GitAnnex\"
git annex webapp
</pre>

This works, although the DOS box flashes onscreen for maybe 1/10th of a second before nircmd hides it. A git-annex-assistant.bat could run git-annex assistant --autostart, and would be suitable to be setup to run on startup.

(It seems that it's possible to write a VBScript or C# program that sets up a hidden WScript.Shell and runs a command in it. That might avoid the window flash. However, it seems hard to get VBScript to run, and I have not investigated C#.)
