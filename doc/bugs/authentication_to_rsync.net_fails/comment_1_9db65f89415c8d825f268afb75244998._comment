My mistake; the problem was the I was missing /usr/bin/ssh-askpass on my local machine, not the rsync.net host.

I still think this is a bug.  I'm on a debian machine and installed git-annex from its debian package, so seems like the ssh-askpass package should be listed as a dependency.  But that's a debian packaging problem, not a git-annex bug per se, so I'll go file it elsewhere.
