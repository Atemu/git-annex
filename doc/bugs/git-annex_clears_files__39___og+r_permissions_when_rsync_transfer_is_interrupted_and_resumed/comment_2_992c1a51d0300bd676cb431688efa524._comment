Hi Joey,

In fact, this is indirect mode on Linux, ext4.
I'm less worried about preserving +x mode (though I can see why it would be useful). Here I'm referring to plain \"group\" and \"other\" read permissions being cleared.

And I just did a test with a standalone rsync, using rsync -P localhost:file file2 and interrupting it, the partial (and final after resume) file2 still is 644 (and not 600 like in git-annex case).
