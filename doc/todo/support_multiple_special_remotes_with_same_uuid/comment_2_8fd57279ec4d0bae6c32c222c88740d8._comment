Yet another problem with the sameas idea is that old git-annex won't know
what the sameas= value means, and will ignore it. So they'd proceed to use
the wrong uuid for the special remote. That could result in a big mess.

Also, two remotes using the same underlying data need to be encrypted the
same way. Including using the same cipher= value, which is not a value that
the user provides. Basically, all the encryption parameters need to be
shared between two such remotes. 

Also the chunksize parameter needs to be shared, or at least be
set on both if not to the same value.
