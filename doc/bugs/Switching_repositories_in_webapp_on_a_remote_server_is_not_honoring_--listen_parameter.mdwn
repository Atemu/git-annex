### Please describe the problem.
I am running my "origin" repositories on a headless server. Managing these with webapp --listen=<server IP>:<port> is a very conveniant way. Now I am creating more repositories for different content on the same server. When I try to switch the webapp between these repositories webapp gives me a link with 127.0.0.1:<random port> in the URL.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Start webapp on a remote system with --listen parameter.
2. Add an existing (did not try for a new repository) manually created annex to the webapp using "add another local repository" (btw. file select dialog is also not working remotely)
3. You get asked if you want to combine the new annex with the current or to keep them separate (--> keep them separate)
4. You get forwarded to the new webapp instance but with a localhost address (127.0.0.1). The same address is also used when you manually try to swich between repositories using the repository menu.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
4.20130501 on Ubuntu precise from the rubiojr PPA repository

### Please provide any additional information below.
