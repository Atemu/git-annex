My local git index got corrupted and I needed to clone and annex get all data from my main repo.

Some files were never copied anywhere so I am stuck with symlinks to nowhere.

I tried to copy over the symlink with a copy of the actual file, which did not work. Trying to unlock, copying over the symlink, and relock did not work, either.

Then, I copied the annex object to the correct place in .git/annex/objects/..., set all modes, re-ran fsck and the file re-appeared.


Long story short, I think there should be a `git annex reinject $file` or similar which will take a file, either one replacing the symlink or with an arbitrary path, and put it into the correct place in the object store. Called normally, it should reject all reinjects where the checksum does not match. With --force, this should be overridden. For reasons of safety, WORM should always require --force.
