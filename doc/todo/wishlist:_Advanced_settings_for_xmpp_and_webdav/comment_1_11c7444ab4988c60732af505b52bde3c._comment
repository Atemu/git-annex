It would actually be very nice if this could be done with hooks too.

Especially with the new hook method.

Take this hook

	mega-hook = /usr/bin/python2 ~/sources/megaannex/megaannex.py

git-annex could make a request with either the parameter(or environment variable) \"getsettingsobject\" that could return. {\"username\": \"\", \"password\": \"\", \"folder\": \"\"}.

The point being git-annex can request from the hooks program what settings it takes, and give a web interface to set it. Then store the information in the creds folder(ew ew, that folder is unencrypted, oh well) and pass it to the hook on run. 

The advantage being that users wouldn't have to edit a settings file manually (this is currently also the case for the IMAP special remote, which also requires a settings file).
