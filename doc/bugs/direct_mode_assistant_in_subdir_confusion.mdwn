I ran the assistant in a subdir in direct mode, and it seemed to move files from other places outside that subdir
into it, and commit them there. These may have been files that needed to be committed, and it just staged them to the wrong place.

I'm pretty sure this does not affect indirect mode.

The relevant commit, in my family's annex is
22e694549d698922389deb017c39c2b40371cdf0 --[[Joey]]

Was able to reproduce this as follows: 

1. Make 2 repositories A and B, with B in direct mode.
2. In A, touch topfile; git annex add topfile; git annex sync
3. In B: mkdir subdir; cd subdir; git annex assistant

Result is a subdir/topfile appearing in B, which is wrong.

<pre>
 subdir/topfile | 1 +
 topfile   | 1 -
</pre>

Note that manually doing a git-annex sync in B's subdir does not cause this
to happen. It's specific to the assistant somehow.
