restarting == Stop git-annex using the gui (Confirm shutdown daemon). Then check if there are running git process (ps -e |grep git), if there are kill it, if <defunct>, then restart computer. Then launch git-annex using \"git-annex-webapp\" script).

So its a normal program usage (start-stop cycle).

The .git directory is growing. 
Without a single file moving/deleting/renaming/editing in the working directory.

So the .git directory just grows, and I think it is a bug, and a bad one.
(if we ignore the logging problem, the slow startup, the failing of disk full).

I'll give it a spin to the autobuild (http://downloads.kitenet.net/git-annex/autobuild/i386/git-annex-standalone-i386.tar.gz), 
and report back. It will take at least 2 day, to repeat my whole experience. So expect update from me wednesday the soonest.

Best, 
 Laszlo
