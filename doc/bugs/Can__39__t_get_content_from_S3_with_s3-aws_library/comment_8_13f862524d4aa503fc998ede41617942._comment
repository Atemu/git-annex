Ok, so I did ``git annex enableremote cloud datacenter=ap-southeast-2``, and can now get files properly. So from that point of view it now works. And I guess that provides an easy way to reproduce (just set a working S3 remote to the wrong datacenter). I'm prepared to accept that this was something I did somehow (at some point I manually moved files from one S3 bucket (actually account) to another, but it seems that git-annex would have created the bucket, so I'm not sure how the datacenter could be wrong.)

In any case, now I'm not sure exactly which files did get uploaded properly, so will run a ``fsck``. I guess it would be good to either return an error when this happens, or follow the redirect.

Also, I really appreciate the quick response you have to bugs!
