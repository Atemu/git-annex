Unfortunately, the old version of git-annex you have been using is exactly the wrong version, so you ran into this horrible bug, which is fixed in newer versions.

<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/bad_merge_commit_deleting_all_files/>

That page has details, including instructions on how to recover your data.

I hope that you were not using that old version because it's included in some distribution somewhere still?
