I was fighting my way forward until I read here that remote hosts + rsync don't work. Interestingly I got everything working so far, ssh login is keybased, gpg -k works and the remote setup also correctly cooperated with gpg... but it just didn't sync. Any ideas how complex it is to get this last missing piece working?
