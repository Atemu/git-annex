Interesting idea, though a ramdisk seems like overkill; filesystem caching
tends to be quite good. 

It would only speed up branch reads, not writes.

I don't think it would be much faster to read individual files from the
filesystem than reading the data directly out of the git repository.
git pack files are designed for fast random access. On top of that,
the git cat-file --batch interface adds extra context
switches and buffer copies and parsing overhead; something like libgit2
could potentially be quite a bit faster.

Note that git-annex repository v0 did keep the git-annex data in the
regular git tree. My notes during the conversion from that to the branch 
include: "After all that, git-annex turned out to be nearly as fast as
before when it was simply reading files from the filesystem, and actually
faster in some cases." Although I didn't record more detailed benchmark
information. Would be interesting to dig up git-annex 0.20110610 and benchmark
it against the current version. :-)
