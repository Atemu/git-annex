As whereis shows, the content of your file is located only on the repository
chymera@localhost.localdomain:~/data

When you ran git-annex get in chymera@silenthost:~/data, it did not have any
remote that connected it to that repository, so it had no way to get the content. Its only remote,
/run/media/chymera/data0/data, did not contain the content.

The data is being correctly tracked. I do not see any bug here.

You need to track down the chymera@localhost.localdomain:~/data repository, add
a remote pointing to it, and everything will work. Unfortunately, it seems
whatever computer it's located on, git-annex was not able to get a better
hostname for than "localhost", which is kind of unusual. git-annex simply runs
"uname -n" to get the hostname, so whichever of your computers that outputs
"localhost" on is probably the one.
