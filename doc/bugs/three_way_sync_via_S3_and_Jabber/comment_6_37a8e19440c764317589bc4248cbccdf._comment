FYI I've waited a bit and zakaz2.2txt hasn't been syned to either of the other two machines (as appeared to happen after the initial report). Obviously I could wait longer 

Just thought I'd mention it since I'm going offline now which is going to involve hibernating hastur (I suppose I should have mentioned that I do this quite regularly in case it matters). dagon and zakaz will remain on and connected to the net (just me and hastur which are going offline).
