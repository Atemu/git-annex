What I'm seeing is the unicode arrow is replaced with 0092 and the elipsis
with &. It's losing the other byte.

The problem seems to be in the base64 encoding that's done, when the metadata
value contains spaces or a few other problem characters. These same
unicode characters roundtrip through without a problem when not embedded
in a string with spaces.

<pre>
*Utility.Base64> let s = "â€¦"
*Utility.Base64> (s, fromB64 $ toB64 s)
("\8230","&")
</pre>

git-annex also uses base64 for encoding some creds
(and for tagged pushes over XMPP, but only the JID is encoded).

The real culprit is the use of `w82s`, which doesn't handle multi-byte
characters. I can easily fix this by using `encodeW8` instead.
Audited git-annex for other problem w82s uses and don't see any, so will
only need to fix this once.

Added a quickcheck test for fromB64 . toB64 roundtripping.

Unfortunately, the entered unicode characters didn't get saved right,
so git-annex can do nothing to fix data that was already entered.
