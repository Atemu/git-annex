Cache brought back in [[!commit e72ec8b9b23346c4b741a071e9edae4460b233c9]].

Benchmarking git-annex sync --content (w/o --all) with 10k files, there
was very little change, it's only 0.4% faster. With --all, it's 20% faster.

That's kind of weird, because w/o --all it was doing 3 redundant queries,
and --all only adds one more. The first result makes me think that a) git
cat-file is doing its own caching or takes good advantage of disk cache and
b) roundtrip time communicating with it does not seem significant so
--buffer would not be much of an improvement. But the second result muddies
the waters, and I guess it would still be worth trying the --buffer
optimisation.
