Sorry about the delay getting to this, I've been overloaded.

The link that you show:

`Expressionlessm.tar -> ../.git/annex/objects/vk/mF/SHA256-s3131909--a2808d850ba2e880ac58bf622cd68edd7e72ea2775b984d52b5d5266c`

.. That's not right at all.  I don't understand in the least how this could happen, and am flummoxed how to try to debug it. It just doesn't match anything I know about how the code works.

If I understand you correctly, it's only happening with one particular file content.

I think you either need to rule out it being due to the way you've installed git-annex, perhaps by installing the linux standalone tarball, and seeing if you can get the same behavior with that. Or you could send me the repository by email (joey@kitenet.net) and I'll see if I can reproduce it, and if so, will certainly be able to debug and fix it.
