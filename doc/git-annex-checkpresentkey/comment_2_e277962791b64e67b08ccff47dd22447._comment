It makes sense that checkpresentkey could report different information than
whereis, because whereis only reports on logged location information,
while checkpresentkey actively checks the remote.

I'm not entirely clear on how an external special remote could not support
checkpresent, I suppose you might mean it always fails or is just not
implemented (so basically fails). That would be a problem with the remote's
implementation. If it's something else, open a bug report.
