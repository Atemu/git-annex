If the remotes have the same UUID, then one of them cannot be marked dead
unless all of them are, because git-annex stores all such information under
the UUID.

git-annex checks before accessing a remote that it has the UUID
it expects it to have. When the remote is on local media, the locally
cached UUID is simply invalidated if a new repository with a different UUID
appears there. Many of us git-annex users swap drives all the time on the
same mount point. git-annex deals with this just fine.

In your scenario, smallusb and smallusb2 etc
all point to the same path. For smallusb git-annex had cached a UUID that 
is marked dead. When a new git-annex repository appeared
there, git-annex automatically changed the UUID that it had cached for
smallusb to the new UUID. It then proceeds to work entirely as it's
supposed to.

I don't see a bug here. If you disagree please show how git-annex does
something wrong in this situation.
