For using Backblaze B2 as a special remote, there are currently two
choices:

* Using [[special_remotes/rclone]]  
  (Actively maintained)
* A dedicated special remote, <https://github.com/encryptio/git-annex-remote-b2>  
  (Last updated 2016)

At this time it's not clear which is better, so if you find one works
better than the other, please comment below.
