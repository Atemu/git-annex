As one example, I just had a `git-annex-copy` command fail twice with `git-annex: thread blocked indefinitely in an STM transaction`, then have the same command succeed (or at least get much further -- still running) on the third try.   I can write my own wrappers to mask such errors, but a built-in implementation seems generally useful and would know better which failures are likely transient.
