I do not understand this limitation ! Why the git-annex exclude the **.git** directory. If the .git is not int the root annex, what the problem ?

Effectively, for me, this limitation is a big problem for archive my working directory (it's contain a some .git folders)

more, is there a command to showing the files not in the annex after executing \"git annex add .\" exist ?

Because it's dangerous to believe that the data is in backup, but in the reality they have not saved

It's a pity, that powerful archiver tool is limited by himself, it lacks some features to be perfectly.

This does not affect your excelent work !
