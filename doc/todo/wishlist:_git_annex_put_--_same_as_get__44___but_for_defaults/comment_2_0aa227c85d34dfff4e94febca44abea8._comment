In my case, the remotes are the same, but adding a new option could make sense.

And while I can tell mr what to do explicitly, I would prefer if it did the right thing all by itself. Having to change configs in two separate places is less than ideal.

I am not sure what you mean by `git annex push` as that does not exist. Did you mean copy?
