Hi Joey,

I really like git-annex but there is one thing which annoys me and friends of mine: Automatic repo upgrades.

I just installed the newer version as an unstable package from my distro[^1] for a test and noticed afterwards that git-annex v7[^2] doesn't work anymore.

This is something I would like to be warned about in advance; it's nothing I would expect. Imagine a repo shared between people. One of them gets a new version of git-annex installed by the system admin, thus converting the repo accidentally, without even noticing. The others will be happy.

So please document `annex.autoupgraderepository` in the man page and set it to `false` by default.

Stay happy and healthy,

Johannes
