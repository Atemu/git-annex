Tell your git-annex stories here. Feel free to give as little or as much detail as appropriate about how you're using it. How's it working out for you?

I'll start with a comment a user just posted to IRC:

<pre>
oh my god, git-annex is amazing
this is the revolution in fucking with gigantic piles of files that I've been waiting for
</pre>

And then my own story: I have a ton of drives. I have a lot of servers. I
live in a cabin on **dialup** and often have 1 hour on broadband in a week
to get everything I need. Without git-annex, managing all this would not be
possible. It works perfectly for me, not a surprise since I wrote it, but
still, it's a different level of "perfect" than anything I could put
together before.
