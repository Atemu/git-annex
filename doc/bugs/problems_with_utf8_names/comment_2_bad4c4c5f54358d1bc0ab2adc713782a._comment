This (rather longish) thread discusses the current situation, the planned changes for 7.2 and the various issues: http://haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2011-November/021115.html

The summary seems to be: From 7.2 on, getDirectoryContents _will_ return proper Strings, i.e. where a Char represents a Unicode code point, and not a Word8, which will fix the problem of outputting them.
