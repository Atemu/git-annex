Since upgrading to git-annex 7.20190912, when doing `git status` I keep getting the message `Refresh index:`, and there is a delay until it turns into something like `Refresh index: 100% (601422/601422), done.`.  I don't recall this happening with earlier `git-annex` versions.  Have others seen this?  (Not a "bug" in terms of correctness, but posting here as it affects usability and speed.)
