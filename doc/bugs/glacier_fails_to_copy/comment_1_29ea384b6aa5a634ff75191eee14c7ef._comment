From where did you install your glacier command?

It does not seem to be the [glacier-cli](https://github.com/basak/glacier-cli)
that git-annex is built to use.

	glacier upload <vault name> <files>

That is not the upload syntax that glacier-cli uses, which is instead
supposed to be:

	glacier archive upload example-vault example-content
