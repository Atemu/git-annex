I tried following the process given in that tip, and it works as it's
supposed to.

The easiest way to reproduce the error message you've reported is:

Is "path_to_repo" a unix path, with slashes in it?
It's hard for me to understand if you've obfuscated that,
or if you literally used the string "path_to_repo" there.

A complete un-edited transcript would clarify things a lot.

A repository url tells git or git-annex *where* to access a repository.
A repository's uuid tells git-annex *which* repository it is.
