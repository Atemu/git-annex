gitosis and gitolite should support git-annex being used to send/receive
files from the repositories they manage. Users with read-only access
could only get files, while users with write access could also put and drop
files.

Doing this right requires modifying both programs, to add [[git-annex-shell]]
to the list of things they can run, and only allow through appropriate
git-annex-shell subcommands to read-only users.

I have posted an RFC for modifying gitolite to the
[gitolite mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/gitolite?lnk=srg).

As I don't write python, someone else is needed to work on gitosis.
