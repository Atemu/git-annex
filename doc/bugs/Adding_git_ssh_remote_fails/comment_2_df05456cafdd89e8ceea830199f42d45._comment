I found the reason for the behavior. On the server, for non-interactive login shells, the right path to git-annex was not set and an old version that was installed by the OS was used instead. I've put the \"export $PATH\" at the right position in .bashrc and now it works. Sorry for the noise.

Best regards, Chris
