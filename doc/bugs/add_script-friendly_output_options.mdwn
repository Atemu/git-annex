I have a need to use git-annex from a larger program. It'd be great if the information output by some of the commands that is descriptive (for example, whereis) could be sent to stdout in a machine-readable format like (preferably) JSON, or XML. That way I can simply read in the output of the command and use the data directly instead of having to parse it via regexes or other such string manipulation.

This could perhaps be triggered by a --json or --xml flag to the relevant commands.
