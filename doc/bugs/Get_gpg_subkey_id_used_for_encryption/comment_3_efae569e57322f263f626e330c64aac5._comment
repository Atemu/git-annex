Right, but if you're not sure if it's encrypted to a given subkey, you can
simply add the subkey with `keyid+='xxx!'` and then you'll know for sure
it's encrypting to it.

Seems to me that users who want to do things with multiple subkeys can just
do that, once, and we avoid needing to add a whole lot of complication to
git-annex.
