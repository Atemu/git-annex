Frankly, even the --fast behavior has an element of surprise to it. For example, one might have two files with identical content. Upon annexing and unannex they suddenly become a hard link to the same file, correct? If this is the case, changes to one will result in changes to the other. I would consider this a very nasty sort of surprise.
