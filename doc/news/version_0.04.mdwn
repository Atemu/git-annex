git-annex 0.04 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Add unlock subcommand, which replaces the symlink with a copy of
     the file's content in preparation of changing it. The "edit" subcommand
     is an alias for unlock.
   * Add lock subcommand.
   * Unlocked files will now automatically be added back into the annex when
     committed (and the updated symlink committed), by some magic in the
     pre-commit hook.
   * The SHA1 backend is now fully usable.
   * Add annex.version, which will be used to automate upgrades
     between incompatible versions.
   * Reorganised the layout of .git/annex/
   * The new layout will be automatically upgraded to the first time
     git-annex is used in a repository with the old layout.
   * Note that git-annex 0.04 cannot transfer content from old repositories
     that have not yet been upgraded.
   * Annexed file contents are now made unwritable and put in unwriteable
     directories, to avoid them accidentially being removed or modified.
     (Thanks Josh Triplett for the idea.)
   * Add build dep on libghc6-testpack-dev. Closes: #[603016](http://bugs.debian.org/603016)
   * Avoid using runghc to run test suite as it is not available on all
     architectures. Closes: #[603006](http://bugs.debian.org/603006)"""]]
