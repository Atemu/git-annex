This error message means that the file's content is not present on your server. 

It seems like git-annex *thinks* the file is there, so it sent it there. But something appears to have happened to it.

You can investigate like this:

* Get the file's key, by running `basename $(git cat-file p 'HEAD:Musik/+‚ÅÑ-/2003 - You Are Here (Bonus Disc)/01 - I've Been Lost.ogg')`
* Run `find` in /mnt/raid/Audio on the server, and grep for that key.

If that finds any files, we may have a git-annex bug of some kind.

If it finds an empty directory, that's an indication that the file's content was sent to the server before, but has now somehow gotten deleted.

----

You may also want to run, on the client: `git annex fsck --fast --from eifel.fritz.box__mnt_raid_Audio`  
That will check that all the files it thinks should be on the server are still there. If it says \"fixing location log\",
then it's found other files that were expected to be on the server but don't seem to be any longer.
