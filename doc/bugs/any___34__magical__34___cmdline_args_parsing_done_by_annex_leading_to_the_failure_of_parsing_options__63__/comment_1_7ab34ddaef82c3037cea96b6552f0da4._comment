You have successfully passed the literal value `'exclude=*.txt'` to
git-annex as the annex.largefiles setting.

Now, git-annex has to parse that value to understand what files you intend
it to treat as large.

Since its preferred content expression parser for the value has no
concept of quoting characters, it fails as shown.

There's no magic here, just you providing a value to git-annex that it does
not understand.

Were you trying to accomplish anything in particular with `'exclude=*.txt'`
that is different from the behavior with `exclude=*.txt`?

(Eg, perhaps you're really trying to exclude a filename with a space in it,
like `*.brain scan` and that seems to call for some form of quoting. Adding
quoting support into git-annex's preferred content expressions would
complicate the parser a lot though. So, in that case, I'd suggest the
workaround of using `*.brain?scan`)
