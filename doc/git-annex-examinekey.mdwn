# NAME

git-annex examinekey - prints information from a key

# SYNOPSIS

git annex examinekey `[key ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command is given a key, and prints information
that can be determined purely by looking at the key.

# OPTIONS

* `--format=value`

  Use custom output formatting.

  The value is a format string, in which '${var}' is expanded to the
  value of a variable. To right-justify a variable with whitespace,
  use '${var;width}' ; to left-justify a variable, use '${var;-width}';
  to escape unusual characters in a variable, use '${escaped_var}'

  To generate a path from the top of the repository to the git-annex
  object for a key, use ${objectpath}. To generate the value of a
  git-annex pointer file for a key, use ${objectpointer}.

  These variables are also available for use in formats: ${key}, ${backend},
  ${bytesize}, ${humansize}, ${keyname}, ${hashdirlower}, ${hashdirmixed},
  ${mtime} (for the mtime field of a WORM key).

  Also, '\\n' is a newline, '\\000' is a NULL, etc.

* `--json`

  Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use
  git-annex. Each line of output is a JSON object.

* `--json-error-messages`

  Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in
  the json instead.

* `--batch`

  Enable batch mode, in which a line containing a key is read from stdin,
  the information about it is output to stdout, and repeat.
