I'm closing this bug report because the git-annex Android app that it
was reported on is now deprecated. Instead, we have
a way to run the regular git-annex build for linux on Android in termux:
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/install_on_Android_in_Termux/>

There were a lot of problems with the way the git-annex Android app was
put together, and I hope this new approach avoids them. If you try it and
still have the bug you reported, please followup and I'll reopen it.
