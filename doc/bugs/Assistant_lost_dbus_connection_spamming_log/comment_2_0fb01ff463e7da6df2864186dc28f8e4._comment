The accept lines just keep coming and coming and coming and coming. About 58 of them between \"lost dbus connection...\" logs. There's interspersed \"Everything up-to-date\" and such.

grep'ing for \"unable\" across all daemon log files gives me nothing.

I haven't futzed with opening the webapp on the NAS yet. Correction: I just did try futzing and I fear there's something in the NAS software I need to figure out before I can do it successfully.
