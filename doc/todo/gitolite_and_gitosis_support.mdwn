gitosis and gitolite should support git-annex being used to send/receive
files from the repositories they manage. Users with read-only access
could only get files, while users with write access could also put and drop
files.

Doing this right requires modifying both programs, to add [[git-annex-shell]]
to the list of things they can run, and only allow through appropriate
git-annex-shell subcommands to read-only users.

I have posted an RFC for modifying gitolite to the
[gitolite mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/gitolite?lnk=srg).

> git-annex-shell is very similar to git-shell. So, one way to enable

> commands to git, which would bypass gitolite's permissions checking.
> Also, it makes sense to limit readonly users to only download, not
> upload/delete files from git-annex. Instead, I suggest adding something
> like this to gitolite's config:
 
	# If set, users with W access can write file contents into the git-annex,
	# and users with R access can read file contents from the git-annex.
	$GL_GIT_ANNEX = 0;

> If this makes sense, I'm sure I can put a patch together for your

> git-annex-shell command line, and modifying R_COMMANDS and W_COMMANDS.

As I don't write python, someone else is needed to work on gitosis.
