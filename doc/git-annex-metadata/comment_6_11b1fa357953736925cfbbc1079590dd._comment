I am [thinking about some abominations](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/3696) to workaround inability to specify smth like

```
licenses/* annex.commit.metadata=(distribution-restrictions=sensitive)
```
in `.gitattributes`. IMHO by limiting to `.commit` the scope when annex should add metadata becomes clear.  Sure thing it could leak across files with the same content (0-length files are most prone) but it is unrelated IMHO since a direct call to `git annex metadata licenses/* -s ...` would have the same effect anyways.
