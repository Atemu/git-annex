Instrumenting, this is fed into git mktree:

	160000 blob 6941fd9c7ad9640f75a02c993245b8de784105e1\tqux\NUL

So the problem is it's got the mode for a submodule, but the wrong type, blob.

Internally, git-annex has generated this, which seems wrong. It should be a TreeCommit.

	TreeBlob (TopFilePath {getTopFilePath = "qux"}) 57344 (Ref "6941fd9c7ad9640f75a02c993245b8de784105e1")

(57344 = 160000 oct)

So need to debug the parsing of the input git tree next..
