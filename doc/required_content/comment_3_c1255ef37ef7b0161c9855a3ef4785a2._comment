I'd like to be able to say things like \"the data must be stored on at least one live server and on at least two offline backups\", where \"live server\" and \"offline backup\" are categories I put my remotes into via something like git annex vicfg.

When I read the first paragraph of this page, I thought that's what it was describing, and was excited to try out that feature. Reading the documentation more carefully, though, it looks like git-annex doesn't actually do this --- the \"required content\" feature requires me to explicitly choose which repos to use for which content. Is that right?

(For example: I'd like to be able to put the remotes \"hd0\", \"hd1\", \"hd2\" into a category \"offline_disks\" and tell git-annex that everything needs to be stored on at least one remote in the \"offline_disks\" category, in addition to other requirements.)
