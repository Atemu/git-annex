`gpg -a --gen-random 1 1` on the command line seems to work. At least, when I just ran it it returned `Xg==`. I'm not super familiar with running gpg on the command line, so I'm not sure if that is the desired result when running that.

The version of gpg is GnuPG/MacGPG2 version 2.0.20. 

I just tried deleting that line from the config file, and now it worked. Would I be able to replace the line after setting up the repository, or is that going to create problems? I'm not entirely sure what that line does, and I'm a little wary about messing with it in case it breaks the functionality of any of the other things that I use gpg for, like email encryption.
