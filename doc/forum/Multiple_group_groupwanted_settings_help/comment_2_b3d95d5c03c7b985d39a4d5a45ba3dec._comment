Thank you for clarifying. I've worked out a setup that seems to do what I want. The rules are a little messier, but not too bad:

    group a1 = a 1 a1store
    group a2 = a 2 a2store
    group b1 = b 1 b1store
    group b2 = b 2 b2store
    
    wanted a1 = groupwanted
    wanted a2 = groupwanted
    wanted b1 = groupwanted
    wanted b2 = groupwanted
    
    groupwanted a1store = not copies=1:1 and not copies=a:1
    groupwanted a2store = not copies=2:1 and not copies=a:1
    groupwanted b1store = not copies=1:1 and not copies=b:1
    groupwanted b2store = not copies=2:1 and not copies=b:1
    
    numcopies default = 2
    config annex.synccontent = true
