Further attempts to get a working git-annex on arm (kirkwood), all failed:

1. I tried to compile git-annex from source, on Debian stretch on my ARM machine - armel, kirkwood subarchitecture, it's a [QNAP Turbo Station](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/armel/ch02s01.html.en) - following the instruction in [fromsource](http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/fromsource/). Make failed with [this error](https://gist.github.com/emanuele/54d0fb1e8905cb48da0cdf9371679462). Additional comments: I used `sudo apt-get build-dep git-annex` to install dependencies but libghc-microlens was missing and I had to install it separately. Make required a large amount of RAM: >500Mb or resident memory and >1Gb of virtual memory, which is more than what's available on such hardware. So make failed but re-running it multiple times worked, until the bug above.
2. I installed git-annex from the official package of Debian testing (buster), via `apt`. The installation went well. Unfortunately, the executable does not work, issuing the same error mentioned before:

```
    # which git-annex
    /usr/bin/git-annex
    # git annex
    error: git-annex died of signal 4
    # git-annex
    Illegal instruction
```

Thanks in advance for any help.
