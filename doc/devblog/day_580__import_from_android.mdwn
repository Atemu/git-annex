It was not very hard to get `git annex import` working with adb special
remotes. This is a nice alternative to installing git-annex on an Android
device for syncing with it. See [[tips/android_sync_with_adb]].

I'm still thinking about supporting import from special remotes that can't
avoid most race conditions. But for adb, the only race conditions that
I couldn't avoid are reasonably narrow, nearly as narrow as `git
checkout`'s own race conditions, with only the added overhead of
adb. So I let them slide.
