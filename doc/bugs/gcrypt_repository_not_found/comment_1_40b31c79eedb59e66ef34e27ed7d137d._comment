\"Repository not found\" is expected when you have not yet pushed with gcrypt.

I think the error is rather that git-annex is passing `--signed=if-asked` to git-remote-gcrypt and it does not like that, dies and never sets up the repository.

I am not sure whether git-annex should stop passing that option, or git-remote-gcrypt should accept the option and do nothing with it.
