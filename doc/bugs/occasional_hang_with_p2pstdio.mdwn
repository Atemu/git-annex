Using git annex get -J20 of 1000 files from ssh remote on localhost,
I've thrice observed it to hang.

	get 99 (from origin...) (checksum...) ok
	get 992 (from origin...) (checksum...) ok
	get 991 (from origin...) (checksum...) ok
	get 993 (from origin...) (checksum...) ok
	get 995 (from origin...) (checksum...) ok
	get 1000 (from origin...) 
	get 1 (from origin...) 
	get 10 (from origin...) 
	get 108 (from origin...) 
	get 105 (from origin...) 
	[some more]

It seems it's trying to receive content of the last files listed, but has
hung somehow in the P2P protocol and not received the data. 
Those are the only files not present. --[[Joey]]

The particular set of files it stalls on seems somewhat deterministic;
the sets have been the same at least twice.

Looking at --debug, it does not seem to get to the point of sending a P2P
request for the keys of the files that it stalls on.

So, a bug setting up the P2P ssh connection, it seems.

Interestingly, the debug log shows it only ran git-annex-shell p2pstdio 
6 times, despite the concurrency of 20. So, the other 14 must have stalled
setting up the connection. Suggests the bug is in the connection pool
code.
