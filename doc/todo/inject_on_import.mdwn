Would it be possible to add an `--inject` option to import?

Say, for example, I have an annex on computer A which has a subset of files and a directory of files which are potentional duplicates of files in the annex.

I would like to do something like this:

    mkdir ~/annex/import
    cd ~/annex/import
    git annex import --deduplicate --inject ~/directory/of/files

This would do the same as `--deduplicate`, except if the file is not present in the annex, it would be injected. For example:

Annex knows about A and B, A is present but B is not.
$DIR contains A, B and C.

A would be deleted from $DIR due to `--deduplicate`.
B would be injected into the repo (making it present) due to `--inject`, then deleted from $DIR.
C would be added to the annex, resulting in this

    $ ls ~/annex/import
    C

<pre>
# mkdir x
# cd x
# l
# git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/joey/tmp/x/.git/
# git annex init
init  ok
(Recording state in git...)
# echo hello > foo
# git annex add foo
add foo ok
(Recording state in git...)
# mkdir ../src
# echo hello > ../src/bar
# echo new > ../src/baz
# git annex import --deduplicate ../src
import src/bar (duplicate) ok
import src/baz ok
(Recording state in git...)
# ls
foo@  src/
# ls ../src/
# ls src
baz@
</pre>

<pre>
              To  only  import  files whose content has not been seen
              before by  git-annex,  use  the  --deduplicate  option.
              Duplicate  files  will be deleted from the import loca‚Äê
              tion.
</pre>
