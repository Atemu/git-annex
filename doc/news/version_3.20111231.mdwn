git-annex 3.20111231 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * sync: Improved to work well without a central bare repository.
     Thanks to Joachim Breitner.
   * Rather than manually committing, pushing, pulling, merging, and git annex
     merging, we encourage you to give "git annex sync" a try.
   * sync --fast: Selects some of the remotes with the lowest annex.cost
     and syncs those, in addition to any specified at the command line.
   * Union merge now finds the least expensive way to represent the merge.
   * reinject: Add a sanity check for using an annexed file as the source file.
   * Properly handle multiline git config values.
   * Fix the hook special remote, which bitrotted a while ago.
   * map: --fast disables use of dot to display map
   * Test suite improvements. Current top-level test coverage: 75%
   * Improve deletion of files from rsync special remotes. Closes: #[652849](http://bugs.debian.org/652849)
   * Add --include, which is the same as --not --exclude.
   * Format strings can be specified using the new --format option, to control
     what is output by git annex find.
   * Support git annex find --json
   * Fixed behavior when multiple insteadOf configs are provided for the
     same url base.
   * Can now be built with older git versions (before 1.7.7); the resulting
     binary should only be used with old git.
   * Updated to build with monad-control 0.3."""]]
