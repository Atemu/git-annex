Setup:

* fresh install of Debian Wheezy with git-annex 4.20130227 pulled in from unstable

Steps:

* clone existing repository and activate assistant
* Have USB drive, U, with repository group `backup` and preferred content string `standard`

Expected:

* Assistant never ever tries to drop anything from U

Actual:

* Assistant immediately tries to drop files from U; fortunately I didn't have the USB drive plugged in
* Changing the preferred content string of U to `present or include=*` stops the dropping, but this was never required before

Additional information:

* The files that the Assistant started trying to drop were, I believe, the first (alphabetically) files in my repository to contain non-ascii characters in their file names (some French accented letters)

Thanks.
