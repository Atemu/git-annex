AFAICS this can only affect `git annex testremote` and not other commands; 
to test behavior when the remote is not accessible, it uses
mkUnavailable which substitutes "!dne!" for various values. 

In the case of an external special remote, this causes it to run
git-annex-remote-!dne! which is intentially not in the PATH. So, 
testremote is testing the behavior when the external special remote
program is missing.

The bug is that in the remote warmup process it tries to run
git-annex-remote-!dne! in order to query it for GETCOST, and this fails.

It's not a race condition; it just fails the first time, and works
the second time (since it has gotten the cost cached then).
