Maybe git considers .git an internal detail, so they might not guarantee things working correctly if it's changed to a symlink?
A clean way to handle this would be to add a 'git annex worktree' command, which normally just passes the rest of the command line to 'git worktree', but handles any git-annex-specific details as needed: e.g. 'git annex worktree add' calls 'git worktree add' then replaces the .git pointer file with symlink; 'git annex worktree remove' puts the .git pointer back then calls 'git worktree remove', etc.
