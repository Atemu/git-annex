Keep in mind that lots of small files may have significant overhead, so a warning that it's not possible to make sure there's enough space would make sense for certain corner cases. Actually finding out the exact overhead is beyond git-annex' scope and, given transparent compression etc, ability, but a warning, optionally with a \"do you want to continue\" prompt can't hurt.
