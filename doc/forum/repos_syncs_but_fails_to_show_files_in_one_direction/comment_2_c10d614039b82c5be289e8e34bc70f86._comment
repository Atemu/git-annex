	[2018-09-12 20:54:23.321141703] call: git [\"--git-dir=.git\",\"--work-tree=.\",\"--literal-pathspecs\",\"-c\",\"core.bare=false\",\"branch\",\"-f\",\"master\",\"refs/heads/master\"]
	fatal: Cannot force update the current branch.

Good spotting. This problem was reported by some people 
[back in 2013](forum/Can_Not_Sync_to_Git_Repo),
but not since then. They were all using direct mode, and I see you are
too.

But, as far as I can see, current git-annex *never* runs "git branch -f".

So, I think you may have an old version of git-annex there..
