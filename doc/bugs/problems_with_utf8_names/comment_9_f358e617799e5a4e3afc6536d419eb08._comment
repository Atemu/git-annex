I can confirm that this is still a problem.  My iTunes Music folder contains songs with Unicode in the file names, and git-annex fails to sync it properly between Mac, ZFS and Linux.

I realize that supporting every filesystem encoding is impossible, but if you used something like `system-filepath` and expected UTF8, it might be better than the current state of affairs.
