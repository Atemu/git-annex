In comment 2, we see a message containing a ssh key with a newline at the
end. That is the control character it's objecting to, and it has good
security reasons to not allow newlines in there (multiline ssh keys could
result in a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys that runs arbitrary commands).

I was able to reproduce that myself. The problem was that the assistant
didn't remove newlines when sending the ssh key. Fixed it.

This bug report is **closed**, for the second time.
If you see this message using any newer version of git-annex,
please file a new bug report.
