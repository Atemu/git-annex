So specifically, this happens for unlocked files in a v7 repository, 
but only when the files are empty.

I suspect this is a bug in git. It might have something to do with
the mention in git-diff-files(1) and git-diff(1) about empty files:

       --ita-invisible-in-index
           By default entries added by "git add -N" appear as an existing
           empty file in "git diff" and a new file in "git diff --cached".

And `git diff` similarly shows a diff for these empty unlocked files.

Makes me suspect there's some hack going on in git WRT empty
files and perhaps it bypasses the smudge/clean filters?

I usually use `git diff --cached` for this kind of thing, and it doesn't have
the problem, but I don't know if it meets your needs either.
