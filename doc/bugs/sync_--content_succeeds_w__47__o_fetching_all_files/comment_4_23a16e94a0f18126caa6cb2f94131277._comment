It would be impossible to sync with a remote that is not enabled,
so I don't know if that is a useful distinction to draw.

Also, if a file is not present in any remotes yet either, syncing will
not get it, and not fail, and leave the local repo without the file's
content. And this is not happening because a remote is not enabled,
but because there is no path to get the data from the repo that contains
it.

I did change the man page to say "The --content option causes the content of annexed files
to also be uploaded and downloaded as necessary, to sync the content between the repository and its remotes."

Which may be explcit enough to remove the ambiguity that surprised you,
but I'm not sure if I've hit on the right wording.
