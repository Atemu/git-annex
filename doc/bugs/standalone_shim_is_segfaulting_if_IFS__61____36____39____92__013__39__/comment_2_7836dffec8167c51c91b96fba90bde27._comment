Hmm, so runshell has some things like

	for lib in $(cat "$base/libdirs"); do
		GIT_ANNEX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=...

Which, with an unusual IFS, probably set the environment variable to
something bogus. Which seems the kind of thing that could break things
badly enough to segfault.

I have so far not been able to reproduce it, I tried:

	tar zxvf ~/src/git-annex/tmp/git-annex-standalone-amd64.tar.gz
	cd git-annex.linux/
	IFS=$'\013' ./git-annex version

But this may involve the system the standalone build is used in, if the
problem is this is breaking its isolation from that system. So might need a
particular version skew between the two.

I've applied the obvious changes, so please verify the fix.
