The second transcript seems to show that the first sync never
tries to push to origin. Then the second sync does push to origin. Then the
third sync doesn't push to origin. Since sync always pushes to origin
unless remote.name.annex-push or remote.name.annex-readonly are set,
I remain confused why successive runs would sometimes push and other times
not push.

(It also appears as if stderr output is sometimes appearing before
stdout output that actually comes first. Which makes me not trust this
transcript's paste accuracy either, or maybe something to do with the
terminal is resulting in this unusual output ordering.)

Also, the second sync found one modified file to commit, so something must
have modified that file in between the two sync runs. If a file gets
modified in between two sync runs, they will of course not do the same
thing.
