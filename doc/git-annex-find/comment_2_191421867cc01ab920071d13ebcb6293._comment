You can use `git annex findref master` in a bare repository, which is like
find but operates on some branch.

I am not convinced that find --all would really be that useful, since it
would have to display keys and not filenames, and find is all about displaying
filenames. I did make find error out in a bare repo rather than not doing
anything.
