Vhat kind of annex is this (direct/indirect, on what filesystem, etc.)?

Also what version of git-annex?

I know that direct mode didn't support dropunused, at least before, and on earlier versions of annex switching back to indirect after deleting things in direct didn't work either for dropunused, if I recall correctly.
