Once git has learned that the unlocked files are unmodified, it won't check
them again.

When you clone a repository, git checks out all the unlocked files
as pointer files, and so git's index contains their inodes, and so
no, git status is not slow in that situation.

I think you must have unlocked 1000 files, and then ran git status.
Then it would run git-annex 1000 times to smudge them all.
([[todo/git_smudge_clean_interface_suboptiomal]]).
I benchmarked that scenario to take around 28 seconds on an SSD.

Perhaps you have an old version of git before 2.5? It used to force
the entire content of each large file through a pipe to git-annex.
