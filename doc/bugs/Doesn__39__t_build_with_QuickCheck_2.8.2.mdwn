### Please describe the problem.
I am getting build errors when trying to compile git-annex with QuickCheck 2.8.2.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Build git-annex with QuickCheck 2.8.2, and get the following errors:

[ 30 of 535] Compiling Utility.QuickCheck ( Utility/QuickCheck.hs, dist/build/git-annex/git-annex-tmp/Utility/QuickCheck.o )

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex 6.20160114, on Arch Linux x86_64.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes, it built fine with QuickCheck 2.8. I didn't test with 2.8.1, though.
