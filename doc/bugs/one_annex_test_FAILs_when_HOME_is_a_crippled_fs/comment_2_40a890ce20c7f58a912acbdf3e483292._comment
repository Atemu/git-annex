> Is this about HOME being on the FS, or about git-annex test being run inside the FS?

Both. In [that script](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions/pull/15/files#diff-8364c688b76bfaf5df947cfd4d74eef7R76) I do

[[!format sh \"\"\"
export HOME=/crippledfs
cd $HOME
git annex test
\"\"\"]]

while TMPDIR was **not** set to point to `/crippledfs`
