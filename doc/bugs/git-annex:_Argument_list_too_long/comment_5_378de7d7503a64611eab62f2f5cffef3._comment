Ok, bug can be closed, it was never a bug (at least not in git-annex). I was using the i386 build on a x86_64 machine.

Server is virtual machine from Strato.

$ uname -a
Linux h1774498.stratoserver.net 2.6.32-042stab078.27 #1 SMP Mon Jul 1 20:48:07 MSK 2013 i686 GNU/Linux

Since there was no x86_64 in the uname output, I thought it was a i386 machine. The git-annex binaries gave a \"File not found\" error message, the git binaries worked. Nothing I connected to a wrong architecture... Sorry for the hassle!
