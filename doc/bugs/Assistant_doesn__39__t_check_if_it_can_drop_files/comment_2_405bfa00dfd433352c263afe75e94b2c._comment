Reason is simple: You manually put the repository into the source group, but its preferred content is not set to \"standard\". No matter what group a repository is in, you have to set its preferred content to something, or git-annex will default to assuming you want the repo to retain all files.

So, `git annex wanted mintcream standard` and away you go. You'll also want to set that for the other 2 repos probably..
