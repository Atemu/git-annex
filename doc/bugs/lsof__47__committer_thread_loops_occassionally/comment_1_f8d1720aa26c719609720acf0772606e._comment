I don't think this would eat your battery badly; it's looping for sure, but with a hardcoded 1 second delay I put in to guard against it eating all CPU.

I tried to fix this in commit c4023f785834bc237e5fcdb69e275bbae10dd40b, but I sort of doubt I did.
I made one more commit that will at least tell us what file it is trying to check over and over with lsof.
