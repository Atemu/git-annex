Great that it's working.

Not sure if relevant to your case, but one other way to have multiple checkouts of one repo is [[tips/Using_git-worktree_with_annex]].  Each checkout must be of a different branch though.  On the plus side, they all share one annex, so there is only one copy of each annexed file (for locked files).
