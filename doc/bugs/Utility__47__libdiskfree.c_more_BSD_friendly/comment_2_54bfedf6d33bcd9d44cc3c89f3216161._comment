Happy to support all BSD varients that tested patches can be made for.

I can't apply this patch as-is for several reasons:

* You say you've not tested it yet.
* I recently modified the file to add support for Solaris, and your patch conflicts with that modification.
* Your patch in passing changes the FreeBSD support to use the
  statfs64 structure. AFAIK that has not been tested.
* I think you also broke Android by moving it below the Linux tests.
  The linux tests will probably fire on android, but the linux code
  doesn't work with the android libc.

Your patch would be better if it clearly added support for an OS
(or standard) without touching and breaking existing code that
supports other OSes.

Thanks!
