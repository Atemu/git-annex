### Please describe the problem.

The Box.com/WebDAV special remote fails with this error on my Android tablet:

    WebDAV failed to write file: InternalIOException user error (Network.Socket.setSocketOption: socket option NoDelay unsupported on this system): user error

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

 1. Install the Android beta from the download page.
 2. Create a repository (using the assistant)
 3. (At this point I configured XMPP, if that's relevant.)
 4. Configure a Box.com repository using the assistant

The repository will fail to add with the above error message.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 5.20131221-gf8c928d

Android 4.0.4<br>
Kernel 2.6.35-palm-tenderloin<br>
CyanogenMod 9-20121202-NIGHTLY-tenderloin (HP Touchpad)

### Please provide any additional information below.

I have successfully set up the same Box.com account via the assistant on another machine.

I don't see any mention of WebDAV in daemon.log and friends.  

It seems like NODELAY should be optional, as it's just a performance optimization (and disabling packet coalescing may be battery-hostile on a mobile device, too).
