In a v6 repository, the sqlite database is used to keep track of unlocked
files. If all files are locked, the sqlite database can still be deleted
safely.

I've done some experimentation with deleting the sqlite database when there
are unlocked files, and it seems that running `git annex fsck` manages to
recover the deleted state and restores the database.
