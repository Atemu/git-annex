I tried I again with different usb sticks and filesystems, and it seems to be happening only with VFAT (e.g not ext)
Retracing my steps here  is what I do:

1. Create a repository on my local machine

2. Create a non bare repository on usb, and combine the two

3. Add a file on my machine

4. It doesn't synchronise, and I get the missing index error


It happens the other way around too, if I

1. Create a regular repository on usb

2. Try to create a paired repository on my machine, I get a straight up

       Internal Server Error

       /mnt/usb/annexdir/.git/index: copyFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)
