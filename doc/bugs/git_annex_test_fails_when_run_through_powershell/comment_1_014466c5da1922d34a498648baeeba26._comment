Is the "mv" error message part of the output around the failing addurl
test, or the failing import test? Not clear from your paste.

The "cannot move" message is not an error message from an external "mv"
command. This error comes from Win32.moveFileEx, which fails on cross-device
renames.

Of course, import is supposed to work across devices, and the code
calls `moveFile`, which is supposed to catch rename errors and fall
back to an external mv command. Seems that fallback is not working on
Windows.
