This feels like such an honor. hahah

I would absolutely love that.

Just give me a few days to get it working with `pip` (so people don't have to mess around with their $PATH), document it better, and run `git annex testremote` a bazillion times on it.

Thank you for being awesome, Joey, and writing this awesome tool.
