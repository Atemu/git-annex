I just tried installing git-annex using Cabal today, but only got git-annex-4.20131002, even from source, which seems to predate your last comment, and no other branch seem to provide the yesod fix. Should I get the source from somewhere else than kitenet to try this out (if you think it is in shape to be tested)?
