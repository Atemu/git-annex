I got some problems building gpm on 10.9, will have to dig a bit more and see what's going on. It might be my environment. But for now I can't build gpm, thus no gnutls. I could try to build and install git-annex only without the assistant and webapp.

BTW, how is the .app file generated? Is there an Xcode project or something like that?
