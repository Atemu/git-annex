git-annex does not have a built-in file manager. I don't know how to get android to display a file manager; if there's a command that can be run, or an intent that can be used to get one, git-annex could do that. But I don't think android typically includes a file manager, I have only seen them as OEM addons on some of the more laptop form factor android devices.

I think that the android web browser also does not support browsing file:// uri, which is what git-annex falls back to when it cannot file a file manager to top.
