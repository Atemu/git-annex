Oh, indeed, I was confused because this is one of the directories that ended up as a small file : \"Genesis/...And\ Then\ There\ Were\ Three\" !  it's indeed a dotfile, kind of.

Sorry !

Also, I was surprised to find that include= expressions were relative to the part of the tree I was exporting and not the git-annex root ?
