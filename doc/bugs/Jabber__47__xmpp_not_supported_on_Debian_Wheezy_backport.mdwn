### Please describe the problem.
I've installed Git-annex via the backport, everything looks fine. But when I go to Configuration>Configure jabber account I've got this message :

[[!format sh """
 Jabber not supported
 This build of git-annex does not support Jabber. Sorry !
"""]]

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
5.20140117~bpo70+1 and Debian Wheezy with lxde

> Build dependency problem. Fixed and backport updated. [[done]] --[[Joey]]
