@joey how do I use stackage when using `cabal install`. I tried putting the `cabal.config` into `~/.cabal` but still keep getting the same DAV dependency error.

I also tried building on Debian after running:

    cabal update; cabal unpack git-annex
    sudo apt-get build-dep git-annex`

Results:

    âž¤ cabal configure -v
    /usr/bin/ghc --numeric-version
    looking for tool \"ghc-pkg\" near compiler in /usr/bin
    found ghc-pkg in /usr/bin/ghc-pkg
    /usr/bin/ghc-pkg --version
    /usr/bin/ghc --supported-languages
    /usr/bin/ghc --info

    <command line>: cannot satisfy -package Cabal-1.18.1.3
        (use -v for more information)

I'm not a Haskell programmer, so I have no idea how to get this all working, nor how to install a new version of git-annex.
