Aha, there is a bug indeed; fscking a dead repository always claims to
be "fixing location log", but the location log is fine and doesn't need
fixing. Fixed that.

As to discovering when you're in a dead repository, there are a lot of
things that could be done, but most of them seem to add special cases
that are complicating both to implement and for parsing the resulting
output (like putting "(dead)" next to the description/name of a
dead repository). Seems reasonable to have fsck note when the repository
it's checking is dead, and leave it at that.
