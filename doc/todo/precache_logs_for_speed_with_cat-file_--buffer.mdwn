Like --all was sped up 2x-16x in 
[[!commit d010ab04be5a8d74fe85a2fa27a853784d1f9009]], commands
that ls-files the worktree may be sped up by using cat-file --buffer
to get location logs (and maybe other logs) more efficiently,
and precache them.

Unlike --all, each file's blob will need to be itself catted with cat-file
to find the key, before passing that to cat-file --buffer. Currently that's
done later by lookupFile, so things like withFilesInGit will need to be
changed to pass the Key along. 

Probably that extra round trip means the performance improvement will not
be as good as --all's was, but it could still be significant.

catObjectStream not supporting newline or carriage return needs to be dealt
with somehow first, because worktree filenames can contain either.

One odd edge case is, could there be a worktree file that refers to a key
with no location log? In that case, catObjectStream would skip it. This
doesn't usually happen, but it might be able to happen after a `git annex
forget`.

Perhaps both the newline and the missing location log could be dealt with
together, by making catObjectStream not skip them, but return an item
with no log file content.
