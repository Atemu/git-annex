You say you changed `origin` and `here` to be in the manual group, but did you set their preferred-content to `standard`? If you did not, the group setting will not influence which files they want, and the default behavior of wanting all files will be used.

Since you are running the assistant on the server, it will automatically update to have symlinks to new files when the desktop does a git push to it. It sounds like the desktop is failing to push to the server for some reason. You can look at '.git/annex/daemon.log` to see any error messages from `git push`.

If you have `ssh-askpass` installed on the client, it should use it to prompt for any necessary ssh password. Given your described configuration, git-annex will be using your regular ssh keys. You can disable its built-in ssh connection caching with `git config annex.sshcaching false` if desired.
