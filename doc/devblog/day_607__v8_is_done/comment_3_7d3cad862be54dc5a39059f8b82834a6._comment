Adding symlinks for not-present unlocked files in v8 would be great, but if it would hold up the release with SQL db fixes, making that release first would be better.  Some query operations -- like finding all unlocked files, or all files present in one remote but not the other -- currently take a while on large repos; if the SQL refactor could solve that, that by itself would be a major step forward.
