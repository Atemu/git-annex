I didn't explicitly mention it in my last comment (only in [the issue I linked to](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/420#issuecomment-400258309)), but I had already applied the `termux-fix-shebang` fix.  Whilst this helps resolve the other issue, it does *not* help with the fact that `./git-annex.linux/lib/ld-linux.so.3` is a 32-bit binary which crashes with a segfault (SIG11) when run via `runshell`.

So this is still broken for me :-(  Has anyone else had better luck on aarch64 (ARM v8) ?
