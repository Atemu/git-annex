This feels too complicated for the webapp. Especially because annex-ignore is intended to be used when the remote repository does not have git-annex-shell installed, so cannot contain any content. Which should be automatically detected when the webapp is used to set up a repository (or for that matter, when a repository is set up at the command line).
