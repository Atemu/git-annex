ssh:// remotes are not special remotes. Perhaps it would be useful to have
a special remote that wraps a ssh:// remote? This would allow setting up a
ssh:// remote that can be enabled using the webapp's normal UI for enabling
special remotes.

Enabling such a special remote would just make a regular git remote, so
there would be no need to implement the methods to get/put data. (Although
it might need to provide stubs to appease the compiler.)

It could optionally embed the ssh private key into the git-annex branch as
a credential, for when you want anyone who has access to the git repo to be
able to use the (locked-down) git-annex-shell on that server.

I am on the fence about whether this would be useful, and would appreciate
use cases.

One use case I was thinking about was a LAN with a central server, with a
shared account with a git-annex repository on it. But then I realized this
wouldn't really help set up git-annex in that situation, most of the time,
because new clients would have the central server added as their first
remote. 

(It would help if one client paired with another new client, but
that is unncessarily round-about most of the time.) 

It might help in a more complex situation, where the LAN is not the whole
network an a client might come onto the LAN already knowing about the
central server there. --[[Joey]]
