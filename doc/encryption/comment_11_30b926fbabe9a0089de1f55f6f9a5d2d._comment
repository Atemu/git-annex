is there some combination of this and the gcrypt special remote that would give me the following properties:

 1. password-less operation (ie. allow uploading content without the private key)
 2. easy revocation and key rotation (ie. not encrypt directly with GnuPG but instead encrypt a keyfile with the public keys)

It seems to me this would be technically possible, no? A mix of \"hybrid\" and \"sharedpubkey\", basically...?

Hybrid works great, except I can't use it in my scenario because I am trying to automate backups and it will prompt me for the private key password. I guess the solution here is to have a special unencrypted private key for the batch job? Thanks! -- [[anarcat]
