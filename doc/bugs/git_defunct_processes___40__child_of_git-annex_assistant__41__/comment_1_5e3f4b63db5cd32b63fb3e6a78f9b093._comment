Thanks for the note about --allow-empty-message. That appeared in 1.7.2, I've added a fallback for the old version.

As far as I know, the assistant always reaps old children eventually, but it does it somewhat lazily. Effectively each time it starts up a new set of git children it reaps the old set. So you should not see them grow without bounds or anything like that.
