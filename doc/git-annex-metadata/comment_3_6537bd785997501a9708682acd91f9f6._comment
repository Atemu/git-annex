Joey, I feel like I have asked it before, but can't quickly search it up, so asking again (sorry if repeating). By

> To attach metadata to a particular path, rather than a particular key, use .gitattributes .

you meant attaching some other metadata, not really \"git-annex\" metadata, right? 
Or there is a way to specify metadata `key=value` pairs to be attached to annexed files, e.g. smth like

```
*_scans.json annex.metadata=(distribution-restrictions=sensitive)
```
?
