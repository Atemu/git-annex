Comment 6 talked about how to prevent old git-annex from getting confused
when used in a repo with sameas remotes.

If remote.name.annex-uuid contains the uuid that sameas pointed to, then
old git-annex will load the RemoteConfig for that uuid. Which is kind of
... ok? The other gitconfig settings for the remote may or may not work
with that RemoteConfig. But if accessing that remote fails with old
git-annex, no problem. The only concerning thing I think would be if
checkpresent somehow reported all content as missing from the remote... But
if a misconfiguration of the gitconfig can do that, the special remote
implementation is arguably already buggy.

So, I think it's ok to set remote.name.annex-uuid to the sameas
uuid. There will need to be a new config key that indicates the uuid to
get the RemoteConfig from.

Old git-annex enableremote still needs to be prevented from initializing a
sameas remote, as it would set annex-uuid to the wrong uuid.
