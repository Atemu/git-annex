git-annex is not yet formally released. If you [[download]] it from git,
everything described on this web site should already work, and I hope work
well, with these exceptions:

* The SHA1 backend is incomplete.

I reserve the right to change its data formats before the first release,
though I already have enough drives using it that I'd probably have to
write a transition tool anyway!
