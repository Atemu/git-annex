# NAME

git-annex import - move and add files from outside git working copy

# SYNOPSIS

git annex import `[path ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

Moves files from somewhere outside the git working copy, and adds them to
the annex. Individual files to import can be specified.
If a directory is specified, the entire directory is imported.
  
        	git annex import /media/camera/DCIM/*
  
By default, importing two files with the same contents from two different
locations will result in both files being added to the repository.
(With all checksumming backends, including the default SHA256E,
only one copy of the data will be stored.)

# OPTIONS

* `--duplicate`

  Do not delete files from the import location.

  This could allow importing the same files repeatedly
  to different locations in a repository. More likely, it could be used to
  import the same files to a number of different branches or separate git
  repositories.

* `--deduplicate`

  Only import files whose content has not been seen before by git-annex.

  Duplicate files will be deleted from the import location.

* `--skip-duplicates`

  Only import files whose content has not been seen before by git-annex,
  but avoid deleting duplicate files.

* `--clean-duplicates`

  Does not import any files, but any files found in the import location
  that are duplicates of content in the annex are deleted.

* file matching options

  Many of the [[git-annex-matching-options]](1)
  can be used to specify files to import.

		git annex import /dir --include='*.png'

# CAVEATS

Note that using `--deduplicate` or `--clean-duplicates` with the WORM
backend does not look at file content, but filename and mtime.
