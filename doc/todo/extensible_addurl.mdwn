`git annex addurl` supports regular urls, as well as detecting videos that
quvi can download. We'd like to extend this to support extensible uri
handling. 

Use cases range from torrent download support, to pulling data
from scientific data repositories that use their own APIs.

The basic idea is to have external special remotes (or perhaps built-in
ones in some cases), which addurl can use to download an object, referred
to by some uri-like thing. The uri starts with "$downloader:"

	git annex addurl torrent:$foo
	git annex addurl CERN:$bar

Problem: This requires mapping from the name of the downloader, which is
probably the same as the git-annex-remote-$downloader program implementing
the special remote protocol, to the UUID of a remote. That's assuming we
want location tracking to be able to know that a file is both available
from CERN and from a torrent, for example.

It would also be nice to be able to easily configure a regexp that normal
urls, if they match, are made to use a particular downloader. So, for
torrents, this would make matching urls have torrent: prefixed to them.

	git config annex.downloader.torrent.regexp '(^magnet:|\.torrent$)'

It might also be useful to allow bypassing the complexity of the external
special remote interface, and let a downloader be specified simply by:

	git config annex.downloader.torrent.command 'aria2c %url $file'

In this case, the UUID used would be the UUID of the web special remote, I
suppose?
