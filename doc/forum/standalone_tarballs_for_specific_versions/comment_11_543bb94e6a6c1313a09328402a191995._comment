To answer @joeyh's question from a [related bug report](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/kite_net_OSX__47__current__47___distribution_is_8.20200618_but_8.20200720.1_expected/#comment-06e9d73bdaff08d38d991ddc2b946f96) (\"maybe I'm missing something about how problematic the build being slightly behind until the next release is for you\"): it's problematic for [[conda-forge|install/conda]] packaging, because I want conda to install the non-standalone release if possible and automatically fall back on the standalone release if dependencies of the standard release conflict with other packages; for this to work, I need need the standalone release that corresponds to the same version as the standard release.  I could package a standalone-only conda-forge release, marking it as an alpha to keep it from being preferred to the official release; but then there's no seamless fallback if the user wants the specific official version.
