CHECKURL-FAILURE actually supports an error message,
always has. The docs were just wrong.

CHECKPRESENT-FAILURE is not for an exceptional case,
but a usual case. CHECKPRESENT-UNKNOWN is for the exceptional case and
includes an error message.

CLAIMURL-FAILURE means the remote does not claim the url, so there is no
need for an error message since git-annex will use web as usual.

WHEREIS-FAILURE means the remote does not have information for whereis,
it's not an exceptional case. Especially since WHEREIS is not supposed to
use network access or anything.
