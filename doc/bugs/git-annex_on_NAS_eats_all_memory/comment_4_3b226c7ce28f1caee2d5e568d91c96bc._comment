You seem to have catted /proc/pid/cmdline, so the parameters are all
mashed together without the separating `\0` being visible. Not the best way
to examine a process. Use `ps`.

It may be that the --library-path parameter is too long and is being
truncated. That's what appears to be the case when it ends at
"/shimmed/git-annex-shell/git-annex-shell-c".

However, Linux's command-line length limits are much much longer than this
command line, so it shouldn't be truncated. And, I don't know why it would
only be truncated when the script is called by ssh.

I suggest that you edit `git-annex.linux/git-annex-shell`  and
`git-annex.linux/runshell` and `git-annex.linux/bin/git-annex-shell` ; make
the first line of each shell script be "#!/bin/sh -x".

Then you can try running it again via ssh and on the NAS, and paste the
debug output.
