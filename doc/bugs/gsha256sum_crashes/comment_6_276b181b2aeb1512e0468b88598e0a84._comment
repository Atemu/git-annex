I have updated the daily autobuild to use wget and coreutils (for gsha256sum) built using `brew install --build-bottle`. This should mean they are built portably without optimisations for the local CPU.

That seems to be all the software on the build host that was installed using homebrew. So I hope the included rsync, curl xargs, etc are ok without being rebuilt.

This all needs to be tested on a system affected by this problem..
