I agree that (1)-(4) were good properties.  (4) could be mitigated by using `git commit --amend` to merge the lock/unlock change with the previous commit.  But if the previous commit has been pushed to a shared repo, this could cause problems.  Something like [[todo/auto-lock_files_after_one_edit]] would restore (1)-(4), at the cost of requiring manual unlock to edit again as in v5.
