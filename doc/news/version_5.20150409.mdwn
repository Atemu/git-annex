git-annex 5.20150409 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * This fixes a bug in the assistant introduced by the literal pathspec
     changes in version 5.20150406.
   * --quiet now suppresses progress displays from eg, rsync.
     (Second time's the charm..)
   * fromkey, registerurl: When reading from stdin, allow the
     filename and url, respectively, to contain whitespace.
   * add: If annex.largefiles is set and does not match a file that's being
     added, the file will be checked into git rather than being added to the
     annex. Previously, git annex add skipped over such files; this new
     behavior is more useful in direct mode.
   * proxy: Made it work when run in a new repository before initial
     commit.
   * info: Display repository mode: bare when in a bare (non-direct mode)
     repo.
   * importfeed: Fix feed download when curl is used.
   * importfeed: Error out when passed a non-url.
   * webapp: When adding another local repository, and combining it
     with the current repository, the new repository's remote path
     was set to "." rather than the path to the current repository.
     This was a reversion caused by the relative path changes in 5.20150113.
   * contentlocationn: New plumbing command."""]]
