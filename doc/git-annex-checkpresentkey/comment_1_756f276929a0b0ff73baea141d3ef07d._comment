If a key has a URL by which it can be downloaded from an external special remote, and the remote supports checkurl but not checkpresent, checkpresentkey says the key isn't in the remote; but git annex whereis --key says there is.  Maybe it's as intended, checkpresentkey being a plumbing command, but just wanted to note.
