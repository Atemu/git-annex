Ah, thanks, I didn’t realize busybox --install created hardlinks by default. It worked with -s and git-annex is adding files successfully now. I only got this phone recently, I can’t say whether it has ever worked on Samsung Galaxy devices with Android 4.3. Perhaps it hasn’t.

The issue remains that Assistant claimed a file was added successfully while there was a problem with sha256sum.
