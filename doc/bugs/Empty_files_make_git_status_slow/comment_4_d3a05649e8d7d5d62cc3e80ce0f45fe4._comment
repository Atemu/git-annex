Verified to still be the case with current git-annex
and git 2.18.0.

I suppose one workaround would be to default annex.largefiles to your
setting. 

But, the user might want to use `git annex export`, which currently exports
only annexed file, not in-git files. Or there might be a workflow with
git-annex metadata, which likewise can only be added to annexed files. Such
a special case by default may be more trouble than it's worth.

I'm guessing that git uses 0 size in the index to indicate it doesn't know
the stat information for the file, or something like that. Perhaps git
could be changed to use 0 inode instead.
