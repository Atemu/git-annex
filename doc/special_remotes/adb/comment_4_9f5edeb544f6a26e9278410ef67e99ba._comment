It would probably be better to file a bug report about it than to
discuss the problem here. I guess something you could include in the bug
report is how many files are in the directory.

It may be that android's `find` command is either not breaking up the list
of files that it passes to the -exec command at all, or is confused about
how big an argument list it can build up. So this could also depend on your
version of Android, so be sure to include that in the bug report.
