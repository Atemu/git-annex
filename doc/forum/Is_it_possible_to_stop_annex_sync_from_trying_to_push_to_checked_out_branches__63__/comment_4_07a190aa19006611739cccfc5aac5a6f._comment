Thanks. Yes, I have it set to `refuse` globally in `~/.gitconfig`.  I definitely don't want to unset it since that could really screw up my working trees.  Your idea of disabling localization (`LANG=C` or similar, I guess?) and checking for \"refusing to update checked out branch\" sounds reasonable, but I would prefer a way to just stop it even *trying* to update anything other than `synced/$BRANCH`.
