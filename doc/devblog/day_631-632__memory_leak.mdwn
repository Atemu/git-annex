I've spent two days trying to track down a recently introduced memory leak,
or leaks. This was unusually hard because all the profiler could tell
me is the memory is "PINNED", but not what allocated it or anything else
about it. 

I probably should have bisected it, rather than staring at the code and
randomly reimplementing things I thought could be pinning memory. Oops.

And there is more memory that the profiler doesn't even show
being allocated, which got much bigger with a new toolchain, and I have not
gotten to the bottom of that yet.
