I've had a report of the assistant failing to commit when there are a lot
of files on OSX Yosemite.

<pre>
Committer crashed: git: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: resource exhausted (Argument list too long)
[2015-03-22 23:14:42 CET] Committer: warning Committer crashed: git: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: resource exhausted (Argument list too
long)
</pre>

Probably need to tune the command length limit for !linux. --[[Joey]]

> Investigation suggests this is the problem:

	inRepo (Git.LsFiles.notInRepo False $ map changeFile pending)

> If a lot of new files have been added, the `pending` list can be

> 
> It's not the actual commit that fails; that uses Git.Queue and xargs.
