git-annex does try to run git update-index, but it will fail if some other
use of git has the index locked, resulting in that message.

As for the assistant committing deletions, one way that could happen is if
the assistant observes a brief window where the pointer file has been deleted
and the file with the content is not yet in place. But then the assistant
should later notice that the file has come back, and make a new commit
adding it back. If the assistant did not make that later commit, something else
is going on.
