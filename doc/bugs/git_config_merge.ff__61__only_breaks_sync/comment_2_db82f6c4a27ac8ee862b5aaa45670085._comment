Honestly I feel like the (perceived) semantics of sync are broken by this behaviour. I would expect git-annex to do what it has to to make what I asked for happen.

I agree that in general it's a good thing not to needlessly override git settings but for the sync command I really don't see any way that not merging can be considered sensible behaviour. To me as a user it just feels like I changed a setting completely unrelated to git-annex-sync and suddenly sync broke.

Consider this: the git-annex-sync(1) man page never actually mentions that it will run git-merge. On the other hand git-pull(1) is very forthcoming with the fact that it's just a shorthand for `git fetch; git merge` so it's obvious to me that settings affecting merge will affect git-pull, not so for sync.

I've been unable to sync my git-annex repos for a couple of months now because of this issue so firmly believe this is a serious usabiliy issue.

At the very least we have a documentation issue here. Though I would still argue the behaviour is bonkers :)
