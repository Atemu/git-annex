Due to popular demand, git-annex can now be used with bare repositories.

So, for example, you can stash a file away in the origin:
`git annex move mybigfile --to origin`

Of course, for that to work, the bare repository has to be on a system with
[[git-annex-shell]] installed. If "origin" is on GitWeb, you still can't
use git-annex to store stuff there.

Known to work ok:

* `git annex move --to` and `--from`, when pointed at a bare repository.
* `git annex copy` ditto.
* `git annex drop` can check that a bare repository has a copy of data
  that is being dropped.
* `git annex get` can transfer data from a bare repository.
* Most other stuff (ie, init, describe, trust, etc.)

There are a few caveats to keep in mind when using bare repositories:

* A few subcommands, like `unused` cannot be run in a bare repository.
  Those subcommands will refuse to do anything.
