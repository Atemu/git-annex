`git annex export` normally exports all files in the specified tree,
which is generally what the user wants.
But, in some situations, the user may want to export a subset of files,
in a way that can be well expressed by a preferred content expression.

For example, they may want to export .mp3 files but not the .wav
files used to produce those.

Or, export podcasts, but not ones in a "old" directory that have already
been listened to.

It seems doable to make `git annex export` honor whatever
preferred content settings have been configured for the remote.
(And `git annex sync --content` too.)

Logs.Export already records the tree that the user chose to export
into the git-annex branch. Should excluded files be present in that
tree or not? A good reason to do that is that if the preferred content
settings change, the next export will pick up on the change, since
the exported tree differs from the tree to be exported.
So: Make export of a tree filter that tree through the preferred
content of the remote, and use the new tree as the tree that really
gets exported, recording it in the git-annex branch. But the remote
tracking branch will point to the tree that the user chose to export.

Problem: A preferred content expression include=subdir/foo or
exclude=subdir/bar matches relative to the top of the repository.
But `git annex export` may be exporting a sub-tree, and it has no way
of knowing where a provided sub-tree sha is rooted within the larger tree.
What it could do is when provided "master:subdir" know that it's operating
within subdir and prefix that to filenames when matching preferred content.
But that would be inconsistent behavior and could violate least surprise. 
It may be better to add a note that preferred content expressions include=
exclude= etc match relative to the top of the exported tree when exporting
a subtree.

Problem: Each `git-annex sync --content` re-filters the exported tree.
Unnecessary work. If there were a way to look up the original tree that
corresponds with the filtered exported tree, that could be avoided.

## different preferred content for export and import?

May be cases where this makes sense. For example, I might make my phone
prefer all content that has some metadata set, but want to import all files
from my phone (or all files except those in the music directory).

OTOH, that config would cause files imported from the phone to be removed
from it on the next export, unless the necessary metadata got set; git
annex sync --content would not work well.

Better example: Make the phone want all content that is in the laptop
group, so all files on my laptop export to the phone but not others that I
have archived. But want to import all files from the phone except for mp3s.

One way would be new preferred content terminals that match when importing
and exporting:

	(exporting and copies=laptop:1) or (importing and exclude=*.mp3)

This needs preferred content expressions for import to be able to
support things like copies= that need to know the key, as discussed above.

If the import preferred content expression is limited to not include those
terms, the above example can't be used at import time. Unless it can be
simplified before being checked for those terms:

	(false and copies=laptop:1) or (true and exclude=*.mp3)

	false or (true and exclude=*.mp3)

Or there could be separate expressions for import and export.
And this kind of makes sense; the normal preferred content expression
controls what is stored on a remote, so affects export, and the import
preferred content expression is only used to fine-tune which files get
imported from it.

Problem: Suppose a tree is exported to a special remote, and the tree includes some
mp3 files. And then an import is done, excluding mp3 files. That will
create a remote tracking branch that lacks the mp3 files; merging it will
delete them from master. That could be surprising! This is the inverse of
the "import after limited export" problem, but it seems it 
can't be solved in a similar way.

That problem might be a fatal blow to this idea of separate expressions
for import and export. But it's worse than that! -- 

Problem: Suppose a tree is exported to a special remote and the tree
includes mp3 files. Then the remote's preferred content is set to exclude
mp3 files. Then on import from the remote, a tree will be constructed that
lacks the mp3 files that were exported before; merging it will delete them
from master.

That could be avoided by making the import notice that the preferred
content expression has changed, and so throw away the old remote tracking
branch history and import a commit with no parent, avoiding the deletion.
But, if some other file got deleted from the special remote after the
export, the import would then not delete it.

Alternatively, when a preferred content expression doesn't match a file at
import, could check if the same file was present in the last export. (With
same or different content.) If so, assume the preferred content has changed
and that the user does not want to delete this file, so keep it in the
import anyway (using the content that was last exported to it). 
(The state does not currently differentiate between the last export
and the last import, so the file would keep being included in
imports until an export was made that removed it.)

OR, don't match preferred content expressions on import at all; download
everything, and let the user delete unwanted imports locally. Does avoid
all these complications.
