{- git-annex assistant webapp configurator for pairing
 -
 - Pairing works like this:
 -
 - * The user opens StartPairR, which prompts them for a secret.
 - * The user submits it. The pairing secret is stored for later.
 -   A PairReq is broadcast out.
 - * On another device, it's received, and that causes its webapp to 
 -   display an Alert.
 - * The user there clicks the button, which opens FinishPairR,
 -   which prompts them for the same secret.
 - * The secret is used to verify the PairReq. If it checks out,
 -   a PairAck is sent, and the other device adds the ssh key from the
 -   PairReq. An Alert is displayed noting that the pairing has been set up.
 - * The PairAck is received back at the device that started the process.
 -   It's verified using the stored secret. The ssh key from the PairAck
 -   is added. An Alert is displayed noting that the pairing has been set
 -   up. The pairing secret is removed to prevent anyone cracking the
 -   crypto.
