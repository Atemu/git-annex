@Jeremy, it's been a long time since anyone reported having the \"LSOpenURLsWithRole()\". It seemed to go away when the dmg was fixed to include all the necessary libraries. So my guess is you installed it wrong, somehow, and perhaps it's not finding those libraries that are part of the dmg.

You should be able to start the assistant by running it directly from the dmg.
