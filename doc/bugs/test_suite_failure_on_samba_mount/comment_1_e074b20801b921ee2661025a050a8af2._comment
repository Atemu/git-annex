\"unable to create temporary sha1 filename\" is a git error message. I don't actually see any git-annex failure here, just a git failure that seems to lead to a cascade of other failures. 

I'm not sure if the \"/media/freebox/.t/tmprepo3/.git: No such file or directory\" is because git clone has failed due to the other errors, or if git clone somehow failed to set up the .git directory.

It would probably be helpful to have a play around with git on this filesystem and see what breaks. Alternatively, you can use git-annex with `--debug` to see the git commands it's running that fail, and try them yourself and perhaps strace or gdb them or something to see where they go wrong.
