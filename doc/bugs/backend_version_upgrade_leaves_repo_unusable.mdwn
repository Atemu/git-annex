foo is a local repo, bar is a bare remote.

I upgraded foo's git-annex to 0.20110325 and upgraded a local repo backend
to version 2. I then ran `git annex copy . --to bar` and checked the
remote. This created WORM:SHA512--123123 files in annex/objects.
Understandable but unwanted. So I upgraded git-annex on bar's machine, as
well.

    % git annex copy . --to bar
    copy quux (checking bar) git-annex-shell: Repository version 1 is not supported. Upgrade this repository: git-annex upgrade (to bar)
    git-annex-shell: Repository version 1 is not supported. Upgrade this repository: git-annex upgrade
    rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
    rsync error: error in rsync protocol data stream (code 12) at io.c(601) [sender=3.0.7]
    
      rsync failed -- run git annex again to resume file transfer
    failed

Running `git annex upgrade` on bar's machine I get:

    % git annex upgrade
    upgrade  (v1 to v2) (moving content...) git-annex: Prelude.read: no parse

Again, bar is a bare repo.
Running the copy job again, I am still getting the same error as above (as expected). Partial contents of annex/objects on bar:

    [...]
    SHA512:123
    WORM:SHA512--234
    [...]
