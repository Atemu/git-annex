https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/migrated_files_not_showing_up_in_unused_list/

according to the link above it should be hardlinked to the new key for the new backend, but this isn't the case. this is on btrfs btw. 
this is a test repo with no remotes as another data point. 
also I migrated from SHA256E to SHA256. 

I tried git annex forget --force; git annex sync; git annex unused, still it isn't showing the objects as unused.
