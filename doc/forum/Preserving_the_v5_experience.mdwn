The v5 version had a few advantages over the v7 version (at least when no direct mode was involved); in particular:

1. Annexed and plain git files could be kept in parallel
2. Files that are under annex control are immediately recognized as such (in file managers by displaying a symlink icon)
3. Never is a file readable with its wrong content (an absent file reads as ENOTFOUND rather than "/annex/...")
4. Never do changes resulting from users' workflows (who checks out what where, who locks something) show up in the actual git history.

I'd like to configure my annex repositories to give those properties, but that may need some more options:

* Setting `* annex.largefiles=nothing` in `.gitattributes` restores 1 (and can still be customized)
* Customizing it or users locking files still leaves files in their v7locked state where they can be accidentally read or otherwise look like plain available files (2-4). Having a `annex.neverlock` option that plain-out rejects adding files in locked mode or locking them would keep history and file list clean. That should be a `git annex config` option.
* There could still be an `git annex adjust --locked` that gives users the option to have a locked adjust branch (or lock files in their own adjusted branch) without those changes propagating into every user's history.

When `neverlock` is active and `git add` is run on a largefile, it could reject adding the file, place the users in a `--lock` adjusted branch, or add the file in a locked state.
