it seems that `git-annex` sometimes does commits with empty commit messages. this makes rebasing git-annex branches much much harder than they need to, because rebase freaks out on those weird commits:

<pre>
anarcat@marcos:video$ git rebase --continue
Waiting for Emacs...
Aborting commit due to empty commit message.
Could not commit staged changes.
</pre>

This was trying to fix [[a broken merge|forum/canceling_wrong_repository_merge/]]... --[[anarcat]]
