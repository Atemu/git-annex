A rsync special remote needs ssh to run rsync --server,
you have it running git-annex-shell.

That can't work. It is possible to lock down generic rsync over
ssh to only operate in one directory, but git-annex-shell
is not the tool to do it.

If there's a bug here, it's whatever led you to expect this would work..

(But, if you make a gcrypt special remote, git-annex-shell can be used
to access it, and it'll be all encrypted and files stored with rsync,
and can be locked down.)
