so yeah, it doesn't really work well, and maybe that is to be expected because of symlinks, but it's much worse than that: the original git annex repo will actually be destroyed because git annex import will [[trash the .git metadata directory|bugs/git_annex_import_destroys_a_fellow_git_annex_repository]]. Recovering from that is... interesting, to say the least. :)
