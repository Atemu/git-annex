These instructions don't work for me, unfortunately.  This step:

git push origin master git-annex

results in:

To ssh://my.server.com/home/itz/git/annex.git
 ! [rejected]        git-annex -> git-annex (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://ahiker.mooo.com/home/itz/git/annex.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote
hint: counterpart. Check out this branch and integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g. 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Versions: git 1:1.9.1-1~bpo70+2 , git-annex 5.20141024~bpo70+1 (both packaged by Debian).

(And yes, I did do a pull on master first.  Maybe I need to do a pull on git-annex as well?  Since that's stepping into magic territory, I'm afraid to do so without clear instruction.)
