I highly recommend ensuring that:
1. Each remote can configure a number of maximum simultaneous transfers, where each type of remote comes with a sensible default number.
2. Transfers to multiple individual remotes happen in parallel regardless of their simultaneous transfers setting.

Judging from the fact that simultaneous transfers happen just fine when you hit the > icon in the webapp, I would assume that most of the underbelly for this is already present.
