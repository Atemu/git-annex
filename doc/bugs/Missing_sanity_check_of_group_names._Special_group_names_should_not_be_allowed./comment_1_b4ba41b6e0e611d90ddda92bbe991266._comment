Thanks for pointing out this ambiguity, which I don't remember having
ever considered.

The code for this does look for the name of a trust level first,
and only a group name if it's not a trust level. So, adding a group
with a colliding name will never change the behavior of such a command
or preferred content expression.

The only problem then would be that you couldn't match
on a group by that name. But if you run into that problem,
you can simply rename your group.

So I don't think that git-annex needs a sanity check, really.

(I have added a comment in the code to make clear that the order of
parsing this does matter.)
