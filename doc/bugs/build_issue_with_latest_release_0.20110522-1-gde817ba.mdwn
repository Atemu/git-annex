A recent checkout of git-annex fails to build for me (I've installed the new dependancies as well)

<pre>
[70 of 81] Compiling Command.DropUnused ( Command/DropUnused.hs, Command/DropUnused.o )
[71 of 81] Compiling Command.Status   ( Command/Status.hs, Command/Status.o )

Command/Status.hs:133:37: Not in scope: `swap'
make: *** [git-annex] Error 1
</pre>

it fails on OSX 10.6.x with ghc 6.12.3 and a corresponding haskell-platform install.
