S3 has memory leaks

Sending a file to S3 causes a slow memory increase toward the file size.

Copying the file back from S3 causes a slow memory increase toward the
file size.

The author of hS3 is aware of the problem, and working on it. I think I
have identified the root cause of the buffering; it's done by hS3 so it can
resend the data if S3 sends it a 307 redirect. --[[Joey]]

At least the send leak should be fixed by the patch in the s3-memory-leak
branch in git. That needs a patch to hS3, which I have sent to its author.
