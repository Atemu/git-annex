Nothing for remotes using a hash. However, if the remote is using something
other than a hash, or a hash combined with something else, it might not be
able to regenerate the same key. It may still be able to detect
corrupted content, eg using the hash part of the key.

> Can the protocol specify that the file passed to GENKEY may be a named pipe

I can't think of any situation where git-annex would GENKEY before
it has the full content of a file available.

> add DEBUG and INFO requests

For INFO I'd rather wait for a use case. None of the current backends ever
need to display any messages, except for in the case of an exceptional error,
eg a hardware faulure where hashing. And ERROR would be fine for that.

DEBUG sure.
