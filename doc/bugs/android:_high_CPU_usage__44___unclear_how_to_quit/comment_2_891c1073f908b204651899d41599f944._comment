If you shut down the daemon, it seems to me that the process that was still running would probably be `git annex transferkey` which runs in its own process to upload/download file contents. I normally see 0% to 1% cpu use from git-annex when it is running on my android tablet. It's possible that the 1% use is due to it waking up every second, which got fixed in 9dc2373977d583b4c4aa6cf0555dc97309f89991.
