I fear that preventing merging of branches fetched from the cache remote
in git-annex would be a game of whack-a-mole. There are just too many
ways the user could bypass such protections. Including, for example,
configuring git to fetch from cache to origin/ tracking branches.

I remember at some point discussing isolating repos from one-another so
that data from one repo can't leak across a boundary to another repo, while
still having it be a remote, and it was similarly just not tractable. Can't
seem to find the thread, but it's basically the same problem.

If you do accidentially merge the git-annex branch from a cache remote,
you can always make it dead and use git-annex forget --drop-dead.

If you really want to avoid any possibility of git fetching from the caching
remote, make it a directory special remote! But, there is not currently
any way to make annex.hardlink work for directory special remotes, so it
will be less efficient.
