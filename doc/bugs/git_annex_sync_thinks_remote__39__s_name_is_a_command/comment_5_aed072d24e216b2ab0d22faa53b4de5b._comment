Hi,

I have a similar problem,

    $ git annex sync --content
    commit  ok
    pull origin 
    root@192.168.253.53: error while loading shared libraries: root@192.168.253.53: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
    
    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
    failed

I have also verified the files paths, it seem ok, And effectively, it appear a SSH Caching feature that cause this error.

For resolve it, i have used the **@joey** solution.

I disabled the SSH Caching feature

    git config annex.sshcaching false

Here the result after disable caching feature

    $ git annex sync --content
    commit  (recording state in git...)
    ok
    pull origin 
    ok
    pull origin 
    ok
    push origin
