The app uses the version of git included in it, because using the system's installed version if there is one is likely to run into other version incompatabilities. 

You can either install git-annex using cabal and homebrew, as documented, or you could go in and delete
all the git programs out of the app, and then it'd use the system's git stuff instead.
