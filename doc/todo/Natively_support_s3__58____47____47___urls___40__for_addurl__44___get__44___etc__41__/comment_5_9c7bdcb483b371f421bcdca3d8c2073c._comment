yes, for `s3://` urls there is only a bucket name, not a domain.  Since bucket name is allowed to have `.`, some folks started to use their project domain name as a bucket name (e.g. `openneuro.org`, `images.cocodataset.org`).  Then if you are to access them directly via url, full domain name would be e.g. http://images.cocodataset.org.s3.amazonaws.com, which would start causing troubles if you try to access it via https
