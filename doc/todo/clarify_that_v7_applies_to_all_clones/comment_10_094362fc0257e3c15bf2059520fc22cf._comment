Unless it entered an adjusted unlocked branch, this upgrade cannot have
changed locked files to unlocked files itself. So if you were not using
unlocked files in this repo before, and didn't make any changes after the
upgrade that would add any, you don't need to worry about them.

The only risk if it was downgraded to v5 with an unlocked files
is that a command like `git commit -a` would commit the
large content to git. Easy enough to notice that with `git status` after
the downgrade too.

(But do checkout master if the currently checked out branch is
"adjusted/master(unlocked)")
