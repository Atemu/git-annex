This definitely seems strange to me. i've been using git-annex for a long time, and I have never known `move` was unsafe by default. so I think that `--safe` should definitely be made defautl.

but beyond that, I wouldn't use `--unsafe` as a new flag: we already have `--force` for `--drop` for example, shouldn't we reuse that here as well?
