Thanks, Joey for being open to suggestions!

I was holding my reply back for while to see if more feedbacks comes in. It seems everybody is ok with the current forum. I'm still open to setting up a test forum. Discourse, the forum I have in mind let you couple the forum with a mailing list quite easily.

Best,
Florian
