I first have to say, I have been following and using git annex for ages (5+ years at least), and is my trusted source for all my data. However, for the first time in all these years, I'm seeing a decision that I do not agree with or understand.

Specifically, using `git add .` to add a file to git annex as the default pattern just seems a fundamentally wrong design to me (at least for my usage pattern). I want to be able to use git normally, and have git-annex only get involved when I explicitly request it to, and not for all files. AFAIK, git-lfs does do it right. I understand [annex.largefiles: configuring mixed content repositories](http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/largefiles/) can be configured to get the behavior I want. However, the default behavior should add it to vanilla git, and any other desired behavior can be obtained by the user via annex attributes, or extra command line flags to `git annex add`

Knowing Joey, I assume there's a strong rationale as always, and would love to hear it, but I would still like to STRONGLY REQUEST changing the default behavior.
