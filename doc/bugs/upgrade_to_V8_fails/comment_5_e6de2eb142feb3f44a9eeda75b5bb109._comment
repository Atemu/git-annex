Thanks a lot!

The double symlinks exist, since I often have collections of files living in several subdirectories. This is useful for my scientific paper collection which is one big pile, but I also copy some git-annex symlink to several topical subdiretories. Since its just a symlink this does not take up space. The big advantage is to be able to get the contents of specific topics I'm working on, and dropping them if I don't need them.

I use the same structure for data files that I only use occasionally. (I know about tags, but this is much more convenient.)

As for the error, it's difficult to debug for me. Possibly its the one you found (symlink to non-existing content). Can I go back to the V7 state of the repository by checking out an older git version? If not, I might try on some harddrives that I haven't synced yet since the version 7->8 upgrade.
