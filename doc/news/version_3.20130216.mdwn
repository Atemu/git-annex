git-annex 3.20130216 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Now uses the Haskell uuid library, rather than needing a uuid program.
   * Now uses the Haskell Glob library, rather than pcre-light, avoiding
     the need to install libpcre. Currently done only for Cabal or when
     the Makefile is made to use -DWITH\_GLOB
   * Android port now available (command-line only).
   * New annex.crippledfilesystem setting, allows use of git-annex
     repositories on FAT and even worse filesystems; avoiding use of
     hard links and locked down permissions settings. (Support is incomplete.)
   * init: Detect when the repository is on a filesystem that does not
     support hard links, or symlinks, or unix permissions, and set
     annex.crippledfilesystem, as well as annex.direct.
   * add: Improved detection of files that are modified while being added.
   * Fix a bug in direct mode, introduced in the previous release, where
     if a file was dropped and then got back, it would be stored in indirect
     mode."""]]
