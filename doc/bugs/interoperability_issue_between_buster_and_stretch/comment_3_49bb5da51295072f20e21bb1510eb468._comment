This is a duplicate of
[[todo/Error_when_using_6.20180913_with_6.20170101-1+deb9u2]]
which was fixed in 6.20180926:

  * Fixes a reversion in the last release that broke interoperation with
    older versions of git-annex-shell.

I'm going to assume your version didn't include that fix yet, since you did not
specify the version and I'm offline and can't look up what version of git-annex
was in Debian at the time you filed the bug report.
(Please always include actual version numbers in bug reports.
It always saves me time.)
