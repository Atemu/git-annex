### Please describe the problem.

Two regular repositories created with the assistant, one on the computer and one on an USB stick cannot synchronise. Log reports problem with the index file:

     /media/usb/annex/.git/index: copyFile: does not exist (No such file or directory)

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Create a repository and then another on an usb stick (with `Add another repository`) and add a file to the first one, it doesn't synchronise.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex 5.20141125 from Debian Jessie

### Please provide any additional information below.

I was able to solve the problem by copying the .git/index file from the first repository to the second one.

Also note that the second repository is on a FAT32 usb stick
