By way of a feature request: Maybe the way to do this is to have an additional keyword like \"config\" or \"repo\" that allows you to use vicfg and/or git config to set alternative rules and even additional group names.

In git config:

    annex.groups.<groupname> = present and exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*

in vicfg:

    # (for passport)
    #trust A0637025-ED47-4F95-A887-346121F1B4A0 = semitrusted
    
    # (for passport)
    group A0637025-ED47-4F95-A887-346121F1B4A0 = transfer
    
    # (for passport)
    preferred-content A0637025-ED47-4F95-A887-346121F1B4A0 = repo
    
    # (for transfer)
    group-content transfer = present and exclude=*/archive/* and exclude=archive/*
