Somehow git-annex has again lost a complete rsync remote with encryption enabled...

Both *remoteserver* and *localserver* are rsync remotes with enabled encryption.
All commands are executed on the git repository on my laptop.
Target of origin is a gitolite repository without annex support (thus the two rsync remotes).

Is there a way in git-annex to verify that all files fullfill the numcopies, in my case
numcopies=2, and can be read from the remotes their are on?
I thought that *copy* would verify that, but seems not.
    
    % g a copy --to remoteserver tools
    copy tools/md5_sha1_utility.exe (gpg) (checking remoteserver...) ok
    copy tools/win32diskimager-RELEASE-0.2-r23-win32.zip (checking remoteserver...) ok
    
    % g a copy --to localserver tools
    copy tools/md5_sha1_utility.exe (gpg) (checking localserver...) ok
    copy tools/win32diskimager-RELEASE-0.2-r23-win32.zip (checking localserver...) ok
    
    % g a drop tools
