### Please describe the problem.
On Andorid adding a respository on box.net account to an exisiting repository does not work. The following error message is displayed:


Internal Server Error
WebDAV failed to write file: /etc/ssl/certs/: getDirectoryContents: does not exist (No such file or directory): user error

The directory does not exist, indeed.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Add a repository on a Box.net server to an existing repository from the webapp (encrypted and shared with other devices and friends). The error appears after clicking on "Add repository"
