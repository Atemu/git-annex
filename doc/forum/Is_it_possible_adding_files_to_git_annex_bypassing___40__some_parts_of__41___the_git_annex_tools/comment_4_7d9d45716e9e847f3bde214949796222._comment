Hey, thank you for those comments.

Tried your example joey and it seems to do exactly what I was thinking of. Now I have the roadmap I will adapt my tool to.

Just a few more small questions:

1.) How can I trigger the *(recording state in git...)* after throwing in files with *git -c annex.verify=false -c annex.alwayscommit=false annex setkey ...*?

2.) Can setkey be used on multiple repositories for the same file and then have the file exists in multiple copies after this without an *annex copy*? (Of course only one symlink generation and *git add*)

So thanks again for the fast replies.
