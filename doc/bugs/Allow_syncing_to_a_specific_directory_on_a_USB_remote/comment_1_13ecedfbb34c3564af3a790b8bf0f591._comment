I have a machine with multiple hard drives. One of these drives is strictly used for backups, ie /dev/sdc holds /home and /dev/sdd is a giant drive that i keep a backup of important items that I would like to have readily available in case of a drive failure.  Somewhere in \"add more repositories\" the assistant should be able to create a copy of the repository on the same computer. When I saw the add a removable drive feature i thought it might work but it will not let me select a specific directory. 

Current setup, I have the assistant managing a group of repos:

    /home/me/Videos.Annex
    /home/me/Photos.Annex
    /home/me/Documents.Annex


I access these files via /home/me/DIRECTORY. However in case my /home drive breaks I would like to know that git-annex was faithfully keeping a copy in /mnt/bigdrive as well as on me@someothermachine. I would like to use the assistant to manage: 

    /mnt/bigdrive/Annex.Backups/Videos.Annex
    /mnt/bigdrive/Annex.Backups/Photos.Annex
    /mnt/bigdrive/Annex.Backups/Documents.Annex
