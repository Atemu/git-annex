Can the `annex.addunlocked` be extended to have the same syntax as `annex.largefiles`?  Also, can there be separate settings affecting `git add` and `git annex add`, e.g. `annex.git-add.addunlocked` and `annex.git-annex-add.addunlocked`, with both defaulting to the value of `annex.addunlocked` if not set?

Basically, I want a reliable way to prevent inadvertently adding files as annexed unlocked files.
