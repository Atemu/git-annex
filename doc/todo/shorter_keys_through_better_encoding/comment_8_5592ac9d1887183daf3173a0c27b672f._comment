I don't need strategy nor safety.
Create a tunable for new repos to disable directory sha completely (and if not sustainable - even readonly bit safety) - and that is enough.
I will replay whole my history again onto new repo and make fs snapshotting more frequently.
I can even live without base64.
Changing defaults is undesirable - and that is understandable. 
But we would still prefer to have an option, even if to bear the whole grunt of consequences ourselves.
Sometimes I wonder if it worth to learn Haskell only to fork gitannex for specific needs, but the reason for this encompassing endeavor seems lame :(
