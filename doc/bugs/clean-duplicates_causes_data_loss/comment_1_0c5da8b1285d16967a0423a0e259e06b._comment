Command to exemplify the \"worst case\" (untrusted causing deletion):

    mkdir /tmp/ga-icd
    cd /tmp/ga-icd

    git init origin
    cd origin
    git commit -m create
    git annex init origin
    echo a > a
    echo b > b
    git annex add .
    git commit -m files

    mkdir /tmp/ga-icd/importme
    echo a > a
    echo b > b
    echo c > c

    cd /tmp/ga-icd
    git clone origin import
    git annex init import

So we now have origin (with content for 2 files), import which knows origin has content for both files and directory we want to clean up. The following causes 'b' to be lost (hope you have backups!).

    cd /tmp/ga-icd/origin
    git annex drop b --force
    cd /tmp/ga-icd/import
    git annex untrust origin
    git annex import --clean-duplicates /tmp/ga-icd/importme
