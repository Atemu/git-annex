You are right something weird is going on with the GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION variable even though I have no idea what....

This is the output I get after patching:

â€ºgit annex sync
(\"GIT_ANNEX_SSHOPTION\",Nothing)
commit  (recording state in git...)
ok
pull origin fatal: protocol error: bad line length character: (\"GI
git-annex.exe: unknown command 35.89.33.17

Usage: git-annex command [option ...]
