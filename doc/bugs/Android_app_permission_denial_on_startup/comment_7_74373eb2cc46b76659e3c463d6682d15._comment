As a side node, my device is rooted.  The web browser starts properly when I start it as follows: adb shell; su; /data/data/ga.androidterm/runshell; git annex webapp

However, with previous versions of git-annex for android, I had problems with git-annex when starting it this way; if I recall correctly, ``git annex get`` didn't work.  Will test again when I have time.
