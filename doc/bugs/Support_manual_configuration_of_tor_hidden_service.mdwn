### Please describe the problem.
I am running NixOS, so the automatic configuration of the tor hidden service does not work because system state is not mutable. Could you provide a way to configure the tor hidden service manually, perhaps printing out the configuration instead of installing it?

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
N/A

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
7.2, NixOS

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log


# End of transcript or log.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes, I love it.
