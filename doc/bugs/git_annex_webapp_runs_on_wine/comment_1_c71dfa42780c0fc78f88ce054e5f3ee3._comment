I've had one other user report having this problem. It seems that wine installs some sort of .desktop file claiming it is the One True program to use to open urls. Since git-annex uses the `xdg-open` command, and in some desktop environments that command trusts these .desktop files to be accurate and not nonsensical. So it goes ahead and opens MSIE or whatever.

Happily, git has a configuration setting that you can use to tell it exactly which web browser you want, bypassing all the xdg-open nonsense:

git config web.browser w3m

git-annex honors this configuration setting.

You may also want to investigate the .desktop file that wine has installed on your system, and file appropriate bugs with either your distribution or wine package distributor to get that fixed. It seems that it would affect any program using xdg-open, not only git-annex.
