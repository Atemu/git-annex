### Please describe the problem.
When switching between my 2 repositories I now see a "." repository, see screenshot: http://screencast.com/t/0wxugJ9P 
If I chose to switch to it, I get this error: http://screencast.com/t/5mndGNlhh8oN

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Not sure if this is a real bug, maybe I screwed up?

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
Version: 5.20150929-g7010007 
Build flags: Assistant Webapp Webapp-secure Pairing Testsuite S3 WebDAV FsEvents XMPP DNS Feeds Quvi TDFA TorrentParser Database
MAC OSX 10.10.5

### Please provide any additional information below.

[[!format sh """
# If you can, paste a complete transcript of the problem occurring here.
# If the problem is with the git-annex assistant, paste in .git/annex/daemon.log
there is nothing relevant to this error in there unfortunately.

# End of transcript or log.
"""]]

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
