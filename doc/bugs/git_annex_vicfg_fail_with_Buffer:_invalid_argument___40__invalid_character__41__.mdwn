### Please describe the problem.
On one repos, I cannot run vicfg because git annex complain that

    git-annex: /home/moi/Bibliothèque calibre/.git/annex/config.tmp: commitBuffer: invalid argument (invalid character) failed
    git-annex: vicfg: 1 failed

Note that the assistant and the webapp seem to be working as it should, giving me the possibility to make most of the configuration I want.

The problem does exit on all the clone of the repos.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I don't know if the "è" in the directory name is linked to this. It seem also that the description of one of the repository has been incorrect (something like "toubib: ~/Biblioth⯁⯁⯁que calibre/" where the three ⯁ replace one incorrectly encoded char that was, since then, changed.
