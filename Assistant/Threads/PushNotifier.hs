{- We only pull from one remote out of the set listed in the push
 - notification, as an optimisation.
 -
 - Note that it might be possible (though very unlikely) for the push
 - notification to take a while to be sent, and multiple pushes happen
 - before it is sent, so it includes multiple remotes that were pushed
 - to at different times. 
 -
 - It could then be the case that the remote we choose had the earlier
 - push sent to it, but then failed to get the later push, and so is not
 - fully up-to-date. If that happens, the pushRetryThread will come along
 - and retry the push, and we'll get another notification once it succeeds,
 - and pull again. -}
