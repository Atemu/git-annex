One of the constraints on naming these is that the name needs to not be one
that is likely to get in the way of something the user is doing with
other branches, eg conflicting with another branch they have for
something unrelated to git-annex.

Another constraint is that the name of the branch (either the whole thing
or sometimes just the part after the slash) often appears in the
user's prompt and so it would be good if it were reasonably short and also
reasonably human readable and clear about what thing is checked out.

Those constraints are what led to this name choice. I am well aware there
are reasons people won't typically use () in branch names, which along with
the "adjusted/", helps make a naming conflict unlikely. And it avoids needing
to also put "git-annex" in the branch name to avoid conflicts, so keeps it
short, and the parens imply a relationship to master rather clearly.

I decided that needing to properly quote a shell parameter in the (somewhat
uncommon) case of manually checking the branch out was a reasonable
tradeoff.

It does seem like a bug in bash completion that it doesn't tab complete
this correctly. I notice that tab completing a similar filename does escape
the parens,  so it may be that the bug can be fixed in the git completion
file somehow.
