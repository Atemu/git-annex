What steps will reproduce the problem?

Fresh install on a 12.40 xubuntu with

    cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

I launched the git-annex webapp (the assistant) and the system proposed to create a git-annex repository: I choose ~/annex/ and clicked on "Make repositiry" but I got:

    Internal Server Error

    user error (git ["--git-dir=/home/m/annex/.git","--work-tree=/home/m/annex","commit-tree","4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904"] exited 128)

    git-annex version 3.20130102
 
What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

git-annex version 3.20130102 on Xubuntu 12.04, installed with cabal (got no errors).

Please provide any additional information below.

I do not know if there is any log, or any info about the reason of the failure. Something useful could be that  ~/annex/ now contains an empty git repository, so "something" happened despite the error.
