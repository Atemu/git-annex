### Please describe the problem.
I'm not sure if you'll consider this a bug, or if I'm just doing something wrong, but I'm having trouble compiling git-annex on OmniOS (a derivative of OpenSolaris). I've got GHC 7.6.3 built and installed (bootstrapped using the Solaris binaries for GHC 7.0.3). I used it to build haskell-platform (although I had to disable the OpenGL-related packages to do so), and now I'm trying to use cabal to build git-annex and its dependencies. I've started with a minimal build; this will end up as an archive remote so it should be sufficient. The instructions <http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/cabal/> say to run

    cabal install git-annex --bindir=$HOME/bin -f"-assistant -webapp -webdav -pairing -xmpp -dns"

This builds a bunch of stuff but then fails to compile the network-info package. As I understand it, the git-annex package only needs network-info if it's compiled with pairing supoort (I'm looking at <https://github.com/joeyh/git-annex/blob/master/git-annex.cabal>), and this command is telling it to disable pairing.

Is there some other dependency that needs network-info? Is there a way to find out?

Thanks
