That's the use case I'd guessed, but it seems things would have to line up
exactly for it to work. Ie, I think git-annex requires all the chunks to be
the same size, and may fail in unexpected ways if they are not.

You do not need to worry about any internal caching when modifying the
git-annex branch, because updates to the git-annex branch are always being
merged from remotes, so any such caching has to detect changes and update
itself.
