If youtube-dl supports the web site, `git annex addurl` will automatically
use it to download the video.

Looks like youtube-dl does support twitter, so it should just work.

If it didn't though, I'd punt it over to youtube-dl.

(If you also wanted to archive the twitter
page itself, you could use `git annex addurl --raw` to archive the html.
Although there's a good chance the html alone is not enough, and so you
might want to use other tools to archive javascript and other assets;
this is beyond the scope of git-annex, although of course you can `git
annex add` whatever files you end up downloading.)
