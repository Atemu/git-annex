I am struggling for so long time, everytime getting different errors :( :(

I digged up my backup and started from scratch. Still not working.

On the (linux) server (directory contains already files):

     cd bin
     git init
     git annex init server
     git annex direct
     git annex add .

Then, on the Windows client:

     $ git clone ssh://me@server/srv/data/bin bin
     Cloning into 'bin'...
     warning: remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout.

What's going on here?

EDIT: Of course, I would not ask if everything would work as expected. But the client repository in windows is always empty, no matter what I do (issueing git annex init, git add remote, git annex sync, ...) does not seem to help me ...
