> I have files that match annex.largefiles and therefore should be added to git but not to annex

That's backwards, if they match, they will be added to the annex.

It's not at all clear to me what the bug is supposed to be in what you
showed, or how I'd reproduce whatever the problem was.

I realize you filed this 4 years ago, and it slipped through the cracks
until now, but please followup if possible.
