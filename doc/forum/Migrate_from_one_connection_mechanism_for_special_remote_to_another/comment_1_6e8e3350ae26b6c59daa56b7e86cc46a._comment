Yes, there is an intermediate encryption key.

What may work is to use `git annex enableremote` on the original remote
with `externaltype=rclone`, which will make it use the other program.

Whether this will work depends on implementation details of both special
remotes. If they use the same names/urls/whatever to access the data stored
in them, it should work.
