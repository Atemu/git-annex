### Please describe the problem.

I have a large git-annex repository created using the assistant. It has thousands of files in it and is about 50GB in size.
Yesterday I added a number of new files, and I also created a new "removable drive" repository for it to sync to.

During these operations I could see a large amount of data being added to the git-annex log files.
I left my computer on overnight to finish the sync.

Today I went to check the log files but there was no useful information in them.

Looking at the source I suspect I had a single log file > 1 Megabyte in size, which caused the rotation to occur repeatedly until it rolled off the end.
However, I would have preferred if this large logfile had been kept for more than a couple of hours.

See file contents below

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

See above

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Debian Wheezy, git-annex version: 5.20140210~bpo70+2 from wheezy-backports

### Please provide any additional information below.

When I look at the log files now, I see the following:
-rw-r--r--    1 pgl users     443 Mar  5 21:48 daemon.log

Looking at some of these log files.
