`git-annex import master --from phone` imports the same files over and
over from my phone. Not all files, just a few of them. The affected
files all seem to have multiple copies in the imported tree, with different
ContentIdentifiers for each. Seems the import code is getting confused and
unncessarly importing in that case. --[[Joey]]

Seems that the ContentIdentifier database can actually only store one cid
for a given key at a time, not multiples needed by this. This needs a
change to the db schema to fix, unfortunately.
