# NAME

git-annex transferkeys - transfers keys (deprecated)

# SYNOPSIS

git annex transferkeys

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command is used to transfer data, by the assistant
in git-annex version 8.20201127 and older. It is still included only
to prevent breakage during upgrades.

It is a long-running process, which is fed instructions about the keys
to transfer using an internal stdio protocol, which is
intentionally not documented (as it may change at any time).
