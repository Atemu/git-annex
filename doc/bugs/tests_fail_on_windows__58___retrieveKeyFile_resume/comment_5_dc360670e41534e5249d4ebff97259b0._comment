I tried to reproduce this, but here the same part of the 
test suite fails at an earlier point:

	  Remote Tests
	    testremote type git
	      init:
	  Detected a filesystem without fifo support.
	
	  Disabling ssh connection caching.
	
	  Detected a crippled filesystem.
	(scanning for unlocked files...)
	FAIL
	        Exception: MoveFileEx "C:\\Users\\IEUser\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ranD3A1" Just ".git\\annex\\objects\\37a\\645\\SHA256E-s1048576--bc48211bf79f8e756afe5cb3c44ac0b291da541d27647d3ebec17f73aa2a04c1.this-is-a-test-key\\SHA256E-s1048576--bc48211bf79f8e756afe5cb3c44ac0b291da541d27647d3ebec17f73aa2a04c1.this-is-a-test-key": does not exist (The system cannot find the path specified.)

This failure is really weird. It's Command.TestRemote.randKey failing
to move the temp file it just created into the annex object directory.
I added some debugging just before it moves the file, to see which of
source or destination didn't exist. Result is: Both do exist!

	doesFileExist "C:\\Users\\IEUser\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ranDD65"
	True
	doesDirectoryExist ".git\\annex\\objects\\bf8\\db3\\SHA256E-s1048576--e5c9f51441e7f2669ee7fd518c12c65f1e71fc07416abb4ddee5abcd0333f068.this-is-a-test-key"
	True
	MoveFileEx "C:\\Users\\IEUser\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ranDD65" Just ".git\\annex\\objects\\bf8\\db3\\SHA256E-s1048576--e5c9f51441e7f2669ee7fd518c12c65f1e71fc07416abb4ddee5abcd0333f068.this-is-a-test-key\\SHA256E-s1048576--e5c9f51441e7f2669ee7fd518c12c65f1e71fc07416abb4ddee5abcd0333f068.this-is-a-test-key": does not exist (The system cannot find the path specified.)

WTF

Anyway, I could chase these kind of things for a year and the windows port
would be no better than it's ever been. The point is I currently have no way to
reproduce or debug the original problem except for an autobuilder with a 1 day
turnaround time that's building the master branch.
