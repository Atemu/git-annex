Ok, I think if you upgrade to the current build for Android, you'll find that the problem goes away. I put in a fix several days ago that makes it use much shorter controlpaths.

The question remains why it ever used a path of \"/data/data/ga.androidterm/tmp/fozz@git-annex-markdown.lang.speechmarks.com-fozz_phone.2Dannex.IdWwlXHtSsjVUMcq\". This is 110 bytes; the code checks for a path of longer than 99 bytes. It should have disabled ssh connection caching when it was unable to construct a short enough path.
