It's quite possible that I have started the assistant (on the armhf machine) or the webapp (on the amd64 machine) in one of the subfolders, so yes it looks like that specific bug hit me.

Having looked at the logs, I'm pretty sure that the removal of the original directory was caused by removing the suddenly occuring \"mirror\" folders in a subdirectory.

Reverting proves to be difficult. I created a full copy of the git-annex repo and switched to indirect mode. There are around 500 commits that need to be reverted and about 6 of them are merges which I haven't been able to revert. I have only reverted the non-merge commits and after going back to direct mode there are now around 200 broken symlinks. I'm now assuming that those 200 are the ones that are lost and I need to restore from a backup. Can I rely on that? It's extremely difficult for me to do a full check.

How should I proceed to get this repo (after further repairs) again in sync with the second repo and have the second repo adopt the \"repaired\" state?
