git annex unused supports an --from option to select a specific remote to find unused data in. When you use that on a repository which is not linked to from the current repository by a git remote, git annex fails:

    $ git annex unused --from somerepository
    git-annex: there is no available git remote named somerepository
    $ git annex unused --from repowithremote
    unused repowithremote (checking for unused data...) 
    [...]

As git annex at least for newly-deleted files knows when those are stored in the given repository, git annex should at least find those.
