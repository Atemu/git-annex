thanks for pointing that out, I was wondering about that reading through the documentation.  We're going to give it a quick try and see how it goes.  We've got a very small team (less than five) and we require additional authentication to access the annex. I think it also works out that our company policy is a key rotation upon a departure, I'd be asked to re-create the annex. long-term we may look for other options if it seems too cumbersome but hopefully our turn over rate isn't that high.
