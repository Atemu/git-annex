This would complicate the data structures git-annex needs for an export remote.

Notably, git-annex relies on location tracking information in the git-annex
branch, which tracks whether or not a remote contains an object. With
multiple subdirectories in the same remote, one could contain an object and
another one not. There's no way to record that without some kind of unique
identifier for each tree in the remote.

So I think this is better handled by initializing one remote per export
directory, and using something like S3's fileprefix= option. Of the remotes
supporting exporttree so far, only S3 has such a thing; it would make sense
to add it to webdav, and perhaps rsync and adb. (Seems that for directory
it's easier to just make a new directory.) 

Can I ask what type of special remote you were wanting this feature for?
