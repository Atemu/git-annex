Switching to amazonka would have the benefit of supporting SSL traffic for S3, which is a feature I would enjoy (see git-annex forum thread [No SSL traffic for S3?](http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/No_SSL_traffic_for_S3__63__/)). I have no experience with the amazonka library though, so I can't comment on it.
