git-annex-remote-googledrive compares partial checksums after every transmitted chunk and before resuming a transfer, so it would not be affected by both problems you describe. However, you're probably right that some other remote might not behave that way.

My current workaround is to move the file to a tmp directory specific to the remote (and UUID) and when uploading, prefer files inside this directory. Downsides are that it can use slightly more disc space and that git-annex-remote-googledrive has to handle cleanup itself. But I think it's good enough. And the problem probably does not justify changes as big as apparently needed. Thanks for your thoughts on this!
