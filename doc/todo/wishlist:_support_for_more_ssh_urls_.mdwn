git-annex does not seem to support all kinds of urls that git does.

Specifically, if I have ~/bar set up on host foo:

    [remote "foo"]
    ## this one is not recognized as ssh url at all
    #	url = foo:bar
    ## this one makes git-annex try to access '/~/bar' literally
    #	url = ssh://foo/~/bar
    ## this one works
    	url = ssh://foo/home/tv/bar

> scp-style is now supported.

> `~` expansions (for the user's home, or other users)

> Update: Now `~` expansions are supported. [[done]]
