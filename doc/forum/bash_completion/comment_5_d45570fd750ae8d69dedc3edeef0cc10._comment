I've recently added built-in bash completion to git-annex, which is output
by the `--bash-completion-script` option. It knows about all sub-commands,
and all options, and will automatically always be up-to-date with the
argument parser!

Currently, it only works for completing "git-annex", not "git annex".
Supporting the latter would probably require some hacks to git's own bash
completion code, or possibly a smart way to hook into it.. Help with that
would be appreciated.
