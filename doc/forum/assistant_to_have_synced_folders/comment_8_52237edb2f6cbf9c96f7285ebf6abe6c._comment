Thank you for recording the screencast. Yes, you did all of the steps correctly, that should have worked. Could you please post the output of:

   * `git annex version`
   * `.git/config` from each of the repos created in the screencast
   * `.git/annex/daemon.log` from each of the repos created in the screencast

So we can get some more insight into what the issue might be on your machine. Thank you for your patience and detail.
