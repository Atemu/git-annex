I see the same results (\"`touch: cannot touch 'Zp': File exists`\") on these Debian systems:

    Linux pilot 3.0.3+ #1 SMP Mon Aug 29 15:21:18 EDT 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    Linux neurosis 3.0.0-1-amd64 #1 SMP Sun Jul 24 02:24:44 UTC 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    Linux bucket 2.6.39-2-amd64 #1 SMP Tue Jul 5 02:51:22 UTC 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    Linux psychosis 2.6.37-trunk-amd64 #1 SMP Thu Jan 6 14:13:28 UTC 2011 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    Linux bacon 2.6.32-5-amd64 #1 SMP Thu Aug 12 13:01:50 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux

It does NOT happen on this Ubuntu system:

    Linux esensor 3.0.0-12-generic #20-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 7 14:56:25 UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

So really it seems like only the Ubuntu kernel is the outlier here?  Maybe it has something to do with charsets or something; I think FAT is a mess in that regard and even long versus short filenames can behave differently.
