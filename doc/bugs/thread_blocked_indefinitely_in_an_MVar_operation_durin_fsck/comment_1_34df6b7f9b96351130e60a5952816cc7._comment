Seems your guess is right:

	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/b4/b>sudo chown root.root -R .git/annex/fsck/4625a6de-d8f5-4036-83a5-6e202ad346da/
	joey@darkstar:~/tmp/b4/b>git annex fsck --incremental-schedule 182d
	
	sqlite worker thread crashed: SQLite3 returned ErrorCan'tOpen while attempting to perform prepare "SELECT null from fscked limit 1": unable to open database file
	git-annex: thread blocked indefinitely in an MVar operation

So, fix the owner/permissions (or delete .git/annex/fsck) and you should be good to go.

Cleaned up the error message about the MVar, which is something of a red herring.

BTW, I double-checked, and core.sharedRepository is honored to set the mode
of the fsck database file, so can be used to share a repo amoung multiple users.
