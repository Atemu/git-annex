Is there a sensible way (could be a helper script) to safely (checks for git links to be used etc) to downgrade version from 8 to 5?

Rationale: On the original host (smaug) of the monstrous http://datasets.datalad.org (on falkor) I have managed to invoke our cron update script while using a newer annex and I had no `annex.autoupgraderepository` set, so annex upgraded a number of clones (originally version 5) locally to version 8.  As I am still by default use older annex, I would like to downgrade those clones on smaug back to 5.
