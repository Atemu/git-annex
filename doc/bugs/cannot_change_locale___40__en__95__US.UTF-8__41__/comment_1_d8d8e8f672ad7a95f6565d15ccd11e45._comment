This suggests that your system has misconfigured locales. Perhaps it has
the locale set to en_US.UTF-8 but does not have that locale configured.

Doesn't seem likely to be a bug in git-annex.

The same message is reported in
<http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/view_fails_with___34__invalid_character__34__/>.
Arch linux was also being used there. Surely the Arch wiki has something
about fixing your locale setting? :)
