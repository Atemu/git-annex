Hmm, it used to be that `git add .` would smudge all dotfiles without that
line, but now annex.largefiles has to be configured for it to smudge
anything.

So, this could be dealt with in annex.largefiles. Both "anything" and
"include=*" currently match dotfiles. It's kind of weird really that "*"
matches dotfiles; it does not in the shell. If "*" did not match dotfiles
(and "anything" is just an alias for "include=*"), it would be fairly safe
to remove the ".* !filter" line by default. (If annex.largefiles has a
content-based setting, and a dotfile is large enough or the right mime type
or whatever, it's reasonable to default to smudging it.)

Then, you could set annex.largfiles to match the dotfiles you want,
eg "include=* or include=.mydotfile". You could put the config in
.gitattributes if you want to configure it globally.

This change to annex.largefiles would also let `git-annex add`
stop skipping dotfiles by default; instead annex.largefiles would not match
dotfiles unless the user explicitly configured it to, and so the dotfiles
would be added as small files, directly to git.

I like this because it unifies the behaviors of the two ways of adding,
and it reduces the complexity, rather than adding more.

Removing the ".* !filter" line would need to be done as part of the v8
upgrade, or a later upgrade.
