git-annex 4.20130911 on Debian Wheezy.

Using `git annex initremote type=gcrypt` as described [here](http://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/fully_encrypted_git_repositories_with_gcrypt/) creates the repository and pushes the `git-annex` branch to it.  It doesn't push `master` (or more generally: the currently checked out branch), as I have verified using `git remote show`.

Manually pushing the branch makes `git annex sync` sync both branches with the gcrypt remote.

I think that it should push the current branch upon creation of the special remote, since for at least me, the whole reason for wanting `git-remote-gcrypt` is that metadata as well as data can be stored encrypted on an SSH server.

Thanks for considering this.
