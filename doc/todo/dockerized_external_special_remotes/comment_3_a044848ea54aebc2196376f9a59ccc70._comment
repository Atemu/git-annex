I think this could be a good idea, although I would not want to be forced
to use docker as the only way to install an external special remote either.

It seems that the minimum needed is a way to add a shell script to
PATH with the name of the external special remote program, so git-annex can
run it as usual. Or git-annex could invoke `docker run` itself, but I like
having a shell script because it means git-annex doesn't need to know about
docker and other containerization technologies.

OTOH, I can see it would be nice if `git annex enableremote` could somehow
get everything set up to use docker, and `git annex init` could fully set
up autoenable=true special remotes.

A balance could be for `git annex enableremote` to set up the shell script,
perhaps in `.git/annex/externals/`. Store a few values like which docker
image to use in the remote config, and generate the shell script from that.
Then when a user needs to pass extra parameters to docker, or if they want
to use rkt etc, they can just edit the shell script.
