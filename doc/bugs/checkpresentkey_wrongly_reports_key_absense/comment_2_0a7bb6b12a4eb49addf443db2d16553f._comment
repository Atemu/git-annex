So I guess the problem description is:

checkpresentkey with the uuid of a remote verifies the key is on the
remote, return 1. But, with no uuid, it's supposed to check all remotes,
and instead it seems to fail and return 0 without checking the remote
whose uuid the earlier run of it showed does contain the key.

And I think I see why it would do that. When no remote is given, it reads
the location log, and checks each remote that the location log says
contains the key. So, if the location log is out of date and a remote does
contain the key, it will return 0 w/o checking it.

It would probably make sense for it to actually try all accessible remotes,
on the off chance one of them has the key. That's what the documentation
says it does, although I don't think it ever has.

The original use case for this was
[[todo/checkpresentkey_without_explicit_remote]], and it does seem like
that use case intended to check all remotes, not only ones the location log
has it.
