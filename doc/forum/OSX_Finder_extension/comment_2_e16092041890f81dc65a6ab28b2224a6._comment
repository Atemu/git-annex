I just released an app, still in beta that provides Finder integration for git-annex. It relies on Core Data so it actually requires macOS 10.12 or later. If there is enough need/requests it could probably be updated to support OS-X 10.10 by switching from Core Data to sqllite directly.

The app is called [git-annex-turtle](https://github.com/andrewringler/git-annex-turtle) and available on github.
