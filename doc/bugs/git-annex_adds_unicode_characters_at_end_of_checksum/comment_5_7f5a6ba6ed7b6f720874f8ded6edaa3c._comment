The easy workaround to bugs like this migrate the file to the
SHA256 backend rather than SHA256E.

It may be obvious to us that a file ending in "(feat. xy).mp3"
has an extension of ".mp3" and not of ". xy).mp3", but this is not very
obvious to git-annex, which would like to treat a file ending in ".tar.gz"
as having that compound extension.

The only rule I can think of that would help git-annex understand this is
to not allow punctuation (other than "." in file extensions). Which it
actually already filters out of extensions, which is why the extension it
comes up with is ".xy.mp3". But it could notice the space and closing paren
in the filename and assume those are not part of an extension. It might
bite some file with an extension like .foo_", I can't recall seeing many
such extensions. Ok, made this change.

It remains a bug in the glacier special remote if unicode characters
prevent uploading to it. We can't limit file
extensions to ascii, it's perfectly reasonable to use your native language
characters in a file extension. Leaving bug open since my change does
nothing about whatever upload bug glacier-cli has. Is the python program
failing?
