well, whatever it was, the download from jimmy's git builder works - I got the 20130107 build from his site (since I had problems with your latest osx build) and it didn't show that weird message anymore and let me sync just fine. It might be something with my repo - but the ...07 version seems to be able to handle it just fine.
