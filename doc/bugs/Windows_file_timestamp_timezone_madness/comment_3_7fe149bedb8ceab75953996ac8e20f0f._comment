I have implemented this on the loststamp git branch. It seems to work!

However, it has a big problem:

    If the timezone changes while the assistant (or a long-running command)
    runs, it won't notice, since it only checks the inode cache once, and
    so will use the old delta for all new inode caches it generates for new
    files it's added. Which will result in them seeming changed the next time
    it runs.

So, it would be really nice to be able to check the actual timezone instead.
But I suppose I can make the assistant poll the inode cache file, or check
it when adding a new file, or something like that. Bleagh.
