This issue with sqlite keeps following me!
I randomly get errors while trying to lock files:
```sqlite worker thread crashed: SQLite3 returned ErrorIO while attempting to perform prepare \"SELECT null from content limit 1\": disk I/O error```

Should I worry about the state of my hard drive?
And I don't know if it is intended, but when this happens, the process doesn't stop with a failure code, it just freezes.
