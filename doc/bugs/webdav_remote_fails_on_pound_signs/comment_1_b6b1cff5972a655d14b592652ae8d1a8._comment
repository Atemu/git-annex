I guess that "#" and "?" in a webdav path is just not possible, since
the path becomes part of the url that is used. It might even be legal for a
webdav server to cut those off the url and store data to the basename,
which could overwrite another file that shared that basename.

I don't like escaping those somehow, because the user should expect to see
the same filenames in the export that they have in their tree. So exporting
should fail. And removal should can succeed without doing anything, to
let it recover, which is ok since the file content is certianly not located
at an url containing either of those characters.

I think that S3 might have the same problem, have not tried it yet.
