A few problems with using git-annex this way..

git init fails in sdcard because it tries to chmod something. It works in
the termux home directory. Note that only the git bundled with git-annex
has this problem; the termux one works (probably it's patched like I did in
the android git-annex port). Hacking the standalone build to not run the
bundled git should work. This could be done only when uname -o = Android.
(Update: Fixed)

git annex init fails with a getUserEntryForID exception. 
[[!commit 526243d6f5db6e16c32ed7f835da590b877f78b8]] probably fixed this,
but not tested yet. (Update: Fixed)

The webapp is able to open an url (after I upgraded termux) via xdg-open
(alias for termux-open), but when in /sdcard/t2 it opened an url that
chrome was not able to access, apparently a permissions problem. The
webapp.html does not add any security on android, since it's not a
multiuser unix system, and so it should open the url to the webapp
directly. (Done)

Accessing the sdcard may need termux-setup-storage to be run once, 
depending on the version of android. That sets up $HOME/storage.
The webapp ought to default to making a repository somewhere in there.
(Done)

webbapp won't start on boot, but could be made to using https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:Boot

Apparently termux-exec sets a `LD_PRELOAD` that is not compatible, so
the wrapper script would need to unset it. (Done now)
