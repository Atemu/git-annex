It seems you must have annex.jobs set to something, since concurrency
is enabled without any -J option, so the easy fix is just to unset that.

It kind of looks like your build of git-annex may have been made without
ssh connection caching support, which would happen if its configure program
detected at build time that ssh doesn't support it.

That would be unusual if so, all the builds of git-annex that I'm aware of
are made with ssh that does support it.

There are a couple of even less likely scenarios, like
`GIT_ANNEX_SSH_SOCKET_DIR` being set to a directory you can't write to.

I've changed the code to always say explicitly why ssh caching can't be
enabled. I also let annex.sshcaching override the build-time detection.

I guess that's enough to close this, unless it turns out its
reasons for not enabling it are not one of those I mentioned above, but
something entirely bogus.
