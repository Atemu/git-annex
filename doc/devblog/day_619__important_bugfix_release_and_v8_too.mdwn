A [[nasty_bug|bugs/gcrypt_special_remote_not_working]]
that made git-annex store content on gcrypt and git-lfs
without encrypting it led to a bugfix-only release,
7.20200226.

Since v8 was already close to release -- I was thinking probably Friday --
and the autobuilders are already building that version, it made sense to
move up the v8 release as well, so that's also been released today.

That bug was happened because of an oversight when I was doing the big
remote config parsing change. I tested that a lot, but I didn't think
to test that gcrypt actually stored content encrypted! I need to do
something about [[todo/network_test_suite]], so this kind of breakage
in special remotes can be caught.
