## symlinks

Apparently new versions of Windows have something very like symlinks.
(Or really, 3 or so things not entirely unlike symlinks and all different.)
Stackoverflow has some details.

Make git use them, as it (apparently) does not yet.

(What **does** git do on Windows when it clones a repo with symlinks?)

## POSIX

Lots of ifdefs and pain to deal with POSIX calls in the code base.

Or I could try to use Cywin.
