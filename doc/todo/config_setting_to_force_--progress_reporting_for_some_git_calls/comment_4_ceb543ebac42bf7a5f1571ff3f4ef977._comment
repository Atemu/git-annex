Occurs to me that any git-annex command could result in an automatic
init, and since v7 is default, will enter an adjusted branch when on a
crippled filesystem.

I don't think it makes sense to add --progress to every single
git-annex command.

I suppose, if your code always runs git-annex init after clone, then it
would be good enough to have git-annex init be the only thing that
supports --progress. If something else needs it (maybe the view commands),
we can treat that separately.
