git-annex 3.20130114 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Now handles the case where a file that's being transferred to a remote
     is modified in place, which direct mode allows. When this
     happens, the transfer now fails, rather than allow possibly corrupt
     data into the remote.
   * fsck: Better checking of file content in direct mode.
   * drop: Suggest using git annex move when numcopies prevents dropping a file.
   * webapp: Repo switcher filters out repos that do not exist any more
     (or are on a drive that's not mounted).
   * webapp: Use IP address, rather than localhost, since some systems may
     have configuration problems or other issues that prevent web browsers
     from connecting to the right localhost IP for the webapp.
   * webapp: Adjust longpoll code to work with recent versions of
     shakespeare-js.
   * assistant: Support new gvfs dbus names used in Gnome 3.6.
   * In direct mode, files with the same key are no longer hardlinked, as
     that would cause a surprising behavior if modifying one, where the other
     would also change.
   * webapp: Avoid illegal characters in hostname when creating S3 or
     Glacier remote.
   * assistant: Avoid committer crashing if a file is deleted at the wrong
     instant."""]]
