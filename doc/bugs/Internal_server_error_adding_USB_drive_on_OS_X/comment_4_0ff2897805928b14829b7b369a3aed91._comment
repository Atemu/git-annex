Can you do this:

* `rmdir /Volumes/G-DRIVE\ slim/annex/`

* Stop any git-annex assistant you have running. 

* At the console, run \"git annex webapp\", and reproduce the bug again. When it fails you should see some error message at the console where you started it.

(If you're using the git-annex.app built for OSX, you should instead run the `git-annex-webapp` script included in the app.)
