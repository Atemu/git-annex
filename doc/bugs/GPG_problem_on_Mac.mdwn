### Please describe the problem.
Adding a box.com repository fails with an Internal server error and the message "user error (gpg ["--quiet","--trust-model","always","--batch","--passphrase-fd","48","--symmetric","--force-mdc"] exited 2)"

Looking at the logfile it seems like git-annex is looking for gpg (gpg-agent) in /usr/local/MacGPG2/bin/. On my system it is in /usr/local/bin (installed using homebrew). I do not have the directory /usr/local/MacGPG2/.

Not sure if what the git-annex philosophy is: detect the location of such external programs or ship them together with git-annex.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?
Add a box.com repository (I assume every repository type that uses gpg will fail in the same way) on a Mac.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?
git-annex version 4.20130626-g2dd6f84
Mac OS 10.8.4
