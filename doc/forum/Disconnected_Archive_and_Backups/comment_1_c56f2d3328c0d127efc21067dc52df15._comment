It looks like there is a path the content could go in this case:

    laptop -> USB -> desktop -> NAS

You don't mention how you are syncing, but assuming that you're doing
so in a way that actually transfers the content to each node of that
path (e.g., `git annex sync --content` with appropriately configured
preferred content), then I'd say the answer is \"yes\".
