Update: You are right. It has nothing to do with the connections. I created a new repository without any sync. Same here:

    [2014-07-15 13:53:33 Pacific Daylight Time] main: starting assistant version 5.20140715-g622a376
    [2014-07-15 13:53:33 Pacific Daylight Time] Cronner: You should enable consistency checking to protect your data. 
    (scanning...) [2014-07-15 13:53:38 Pacific Daylight Time] Watcher: Performing startup scan
    (started...) 
    
    git-annex: <stdin>: hGetLine: invalid argument (Bad file descriptor)
    failed
    git-annex: assistant: 1 failed 

It always takes exactly 10 minutes until it dies (you see is started 13:53:33 and it died at 14:03:33 (=modification of daemon.log).
So this is reproduceable ...
