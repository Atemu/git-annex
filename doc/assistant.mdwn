The git-annex assistant makes git-annex easy to use by providing a
automatic management and syncing of your files, and a friendly web frontend
for configuration.

The git-annex assistant is being
[crowd funded on
Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joeyh/git-annex-assistant-like-dropbox-but-with-your-own/).
