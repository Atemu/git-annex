### Please describe the problem.

I just started git-annex, and I can hear the fan of my CPU. That doesn't happen unless the CPU is maxed, and indeed:

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

I am not sure. I just started the webapp, and it seems to be scanning two huge repositories (160GB and 800GB) with lots of files. The larger one is also in the process of being sync'd to the backup drive.

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

My usual bastard build from hell:

### Please provide any additional information below.

Note that I had to close the chromium tab that was displaying the actual webapp UI, because that was taking another 50% of a CPU (I have a dual core).

Note that things calmed down since git-annex started transfering larger files - the webapp only takes 75% of the CPU now. ;) And chromium is negligible. But there clearly seems to be a degenerate case where a lot of small files get transfered that seem to freakout the web UI. -- [[anarcat]]
