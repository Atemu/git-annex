I'm doubtful about this:

* It's not super likely that a debug log will have enough information in it
  to replicate a one-off problem. At best they generally provide some clues
  that need to be confirmed with experiments, so the problem needs to be
  reproduced before I can fix it.
* This risks accumulating a bunch of debug logs if the user is doing things
  that fail. Things can fail for a wide array or reasons that do not need
  to be debugged, eg git-annex get fails all the time for valid reasons
  such as a host not being accessible or drive not being mounted.
* A debug log might contain some sensitive information, git-annex should
  certianly not be sending them around without the user's eyes on them.
* If the user noticed git-annex is accumulating a bunch of debug logs,
  and does feel they are sensitive information, they may lose trust in
  git-annex.
