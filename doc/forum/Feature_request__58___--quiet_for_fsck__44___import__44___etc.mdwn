My main use for git-annex is to manage a photo/video archive of my extended family.

I regularly use `git annex import --clean-duplicates` to clean up old copies before going through the effort of manually putting data into the global directory structure. I only care about seeing how much data was removed, i.e. `git annex import --clean-duplicates foo | grep -v 'not duplicate; skipping'`. It would be a lot nicer to suppress this natively with `--quiet`. Ideally, in this case, only files which are being deleted (i.e. destructive actions), errors, and final stats (how many files were not deleted and how many were deleted) would be printed.

Along similar lines, I don't care about everything which goes right in an `fsck`; I care about anything going wrong. A `--quiet` should print errors and final stats, nothing more.


Best,
Richard
