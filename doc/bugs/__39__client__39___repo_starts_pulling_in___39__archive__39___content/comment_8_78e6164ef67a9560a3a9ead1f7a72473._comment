I've not seen this kind of strange behavior happen again so far.

But I have got another example of a file which I added to git-annex via the assistant not having its symlink added to git.  Again, the content of the file is in git-annex and was even correctly transferred to a couple of remotes, but the symlink is still unstaged.

I tried restarting the assistant to see if that would fix it but that didn't change anything.

I imagine the symlink will be fixed during a daily scan, tomorrow maybe?  Is it problematic for the symlink not to be checked into git for a day?  Is this worth a bug report or is this really harmless behavior?
