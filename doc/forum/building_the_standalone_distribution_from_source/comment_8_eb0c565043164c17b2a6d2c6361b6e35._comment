This was the tarball conda used:

`https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/git-annex-8.20200810-nodep_h1234567_0.tar.bz2`

I noticed you updated the (/install/conda)[https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/conda/] with possible package conflict tips.

The only dependency that was installed when I conda-installed git-annex was this:

`python_abi conda-forge/linux-64::python_abi-3.8-1_cp38`

Which struck me as odd, because I'm running python 3.8.5, not 3.8.1.
Maybe they just have perfectly compatible ABIs, or maybe it's related to the problem you mentioned.
I don't know.

If there's any other test you want me to run, no problem.
