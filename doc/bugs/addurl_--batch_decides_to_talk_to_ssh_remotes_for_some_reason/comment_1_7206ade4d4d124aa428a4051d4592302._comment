I seem to remember you filing a bug about the same thing with whereis,
although I can't find it just now. Let's not file duplicate bugs when
different git-annex commands exhibit the same bevavior, please?

As I said before, when you set up a new git remote, you need to run some
git-annex command so that it can query the UUID of the remote. Or, set
remote.name.annex-ignore to make git-annex not use the remote.

Why does addurl need to set up the remote objects including getting their
UUIDs? Because remotes can claim urls.

(--batch mode can't prevent stuff from prompting for passwords.)
