The current Linux standalone for ARM, used on armv5tel with Debian stretch, does not work:

    $ cd git-annex.linux/
    $ ./runshell 
    $ git annex
    error: git-annex died of signal 4
    $ git-annex
    Illegal instruction


I downloaded the arm tarball, unpacked and did as above. Same if do as above as root or use the alternative way of modifying the PATH, as suggested in the installation instructions. The CPU is Feroceon 88FR131 rev 1 (v5l).

Is there a way of getting a working pre-built git-annex on such a system?

Thanks in advance!
