What version of git-annex was used to get the latest transcript above?

The sequence of commands you gave works fine for me, no error.

(Based on the filename in the error message, it seems likely that `replaceFile` 
is what's failing (called by `toDirectGen`), but that always creates the misctemp
directory if it doesn't exist. Also, the example given doesn't actually
trigger any code path that calls `replaceFile`. This makes me doubt that
a current version of git-annex is being used..)
