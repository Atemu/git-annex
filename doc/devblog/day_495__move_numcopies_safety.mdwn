New version released today with adb special remote, http connection
caching, improved progress displays, annex.retry, and other changes.

I've been rethinking `git annex move` in the context of numcopies
checking. Thanks to a user posting
[[forum/git-annex_move_does_not_appear_to_respect_numcopies]].
Of course, move is known not to do that, but it's useful to get a
perspective that this is susprising behavior and not wanted by that user,
and poorly documented besides.

So, I added `git annex move --safe` which does honor numcopies, so 
it only does a copy when there are not enough copies to move.

I'm leaning toward making that the default behavior, and
needing `git annex move --unsafe` to get the current behavior of moving
without a net. Of course, lots of us probably use move and like the current
behavior, and such a change can break workflows and scripts.
There might be a transition period where move warns when run without --safe
or --unsafe. Feedback welcomed on the bug report 
[[bugs/move_violates_numcopies]].
