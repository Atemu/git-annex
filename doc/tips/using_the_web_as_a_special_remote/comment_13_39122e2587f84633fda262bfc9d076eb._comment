If I have a big repo of YouTube stuff I might have some videos that I want to download with different options. Maybe I want higher quality for some videos, and don't care for others. It seems like youtube-dl-options can only be specified for an entire annex, though. I'd like to be able to do it *per file*.

The main motivation for this is YouTube videos where I only want the audio. Is there a good way to do this? Best I can think of is having a separate annex for audio and video.
