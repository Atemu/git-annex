I don't understand what you're saying about it being the last file to be copied. This can't be stopping the copy from processing files after the one it fails on, and the order of the file in the list of files it's processing cannot be significant, unless you know something I don't know.

What I meant to ask you is whether there is one, particular, specific file on your system that it refuses to copy, or whether it refuses to copy all files, or what.

Anyway, you are going to need to send me a strace, I'm utterly stuck on this.
