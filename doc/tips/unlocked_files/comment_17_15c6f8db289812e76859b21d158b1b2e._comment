Lukey - I tried git config annex.thin true and then git annex fix

Doing it on Windows NTFS drive did not create hard-links. I've followed the instructions. Could not get it to work. Always got copies of files instead of hardlinks.

git-annex (6.20160412) Changelog
  * annex.thin and annex.hardlink are now supported on Windows.

Based on Joey change log - hard links should work on NTFS. According to my obesrvation and a report from colin.brosseau above (titles \"NTFS Make it clear that it'll not work with annex.thin\") it does not work.

Can anyone confirm if git annex can creates NTFS hardlinks? I can file a bug report if needed.

Thanks!
