Also, while browsing the archive for another problem (can not add files because shasum256 is missing and I get a \"dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libintl.8.dylib\" for it's execution when I add the path for /Applications/git-annex.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/sha256sum) I [saw](http://git-annex.branchable.com/install/OSX/old_comments/#comment-94b0f0ba446ca2f1ebd6af44c7afd3be) that it should fall back on haskell code - which it doesn't, so maybe its an old version?
