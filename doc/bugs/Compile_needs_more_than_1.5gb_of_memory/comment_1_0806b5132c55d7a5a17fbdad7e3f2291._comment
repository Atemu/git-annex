You don't need a webapp on your linode, probably, so disable it:

cabal install git-annex -f-WebApp

The template haskell in the webapp about doubles the amount of memory needed to compile it.

----

Alternatively, since git-annex compiles down to a self-contained binary, you can build it on another machine of the same architecture, and just copy the binary over. Or there are all kinds of pre-compiled binaries available for Linux distributions that you can use on your linode.
