Thinking about this more, I think minimally git-annex could support a

    remote.<name>.gpg-options

or

    remote.<name>.gpg-keyring

for options to be passed to gpg.  I'm not sure how automatically setting it to $ANNEX_ROOT/.gnupg/.. would work.


I need to read the encryption code to fully understand it, but I also wonder if there is not also a way to just bypass gpg entirely and store the remote-encryption keys locally in plain text.
