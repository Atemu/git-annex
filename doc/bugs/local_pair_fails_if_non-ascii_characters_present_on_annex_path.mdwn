### Please describe the problem.

When the annex directory has a non-ascii character (like a tilde) on its path, local pairing fails and a couple of instances of the following message appear on the log

"illegal control characters in pairing message; ignoring"

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

* make a new annex repo named on /home/someone/VÃ­deos/blah/ (notice the i with a tilde) on two computers
* try to pair them
