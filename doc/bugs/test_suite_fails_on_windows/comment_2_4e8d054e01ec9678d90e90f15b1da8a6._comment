Tracked it back to runSqliteInfo. Both that and runSqlite use NUL
somewhere.

So the bug is in persistent-sqlite, or one of its dependencies.

Aha! silently-1.2.5, used by persistent in runMigrationSilent,
and it's already been fixed in a point release. I've bumped the dependency,
hopefully that will fix this.
