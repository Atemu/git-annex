I do see XMPP connecting after I enable logging (could the XMPP status be shown in the webapp directly?)

It shows long, long lists of PresenceMessages:

    [2013-04-23 14:55:56 EDT] XMPPClient: connected JID \"...\"
    [2013-04-23 14:55:56 EDT] XMPPClient: received: [PresenceMessage (Presence {presenceType = PresenceAvailable, presenceTo = Just (JID ...

Still no files gets transferred from Box.com to the second machine.  I see:

    [2013-04-23 14:53:41 EDT] main: Syncing with box.com

but no:

    XMPPClient: Syncing

anywhere in the log.

It might not make sense to change it, but it would be useful to still see it (if disabled), especially when there are a few different Box.com directories that are shared with different repositories.

Thanks again for any hints.
