The problem is that "foo.numbers" may appear to have an extension to you,
but "foo.doesnothaveanextension" appears to me to not have an extension.

(And I doubt I'd consider ".numbers" to be an extension either because it's
much longer than any usual extension and looks like like an english word.
"I.like.numbers" does not have an extension IMHO.)

So, git-annex has to somehow guess, and it does this by assuming that all
common filename extensions are less than 4 letters (not including the dot).

The annex.maxextensionlength setting was recently added which lets you tune
this.
