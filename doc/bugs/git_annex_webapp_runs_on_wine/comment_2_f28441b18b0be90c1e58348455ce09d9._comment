Thanks! It looks like it is a xdg issue, I can reproduce it by running xdg-open manually.

Faulty file is:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
~$ grep -ri htmlfile .local/share/applications/
.local/share/applications/wine-extension-htm.desktop
~$ rm .local/share/applications/wine-extension-*
~$ locate .desktop | parallel grep -ri htmlfile {}
\"\"\"]]

Then it tried to open with /usr/bin/emacsclient! In Gnome setting Firefox is listed as default browser, but xdg-settings thinks that it is Epiphany, what a mess..

Anyways, this fixes it:
[[!format sh \"\"\"
~$ xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop
\"\"\"]]
"""]]
