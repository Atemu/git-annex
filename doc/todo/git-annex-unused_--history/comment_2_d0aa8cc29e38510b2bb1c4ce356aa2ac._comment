Another name for a `git-annex unused` switch could be `--unreachable`. I suppose `git-annex gc` would drop unreachable files without a separate `git-annex dropunused` invocation? That would work for me as well.

Personally I don't have the use case of `git-annex unused` only looking at the history of some refs and treating other refs normally.
