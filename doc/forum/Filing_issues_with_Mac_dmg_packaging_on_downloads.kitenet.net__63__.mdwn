Where should questions re: the packaging of the Mac dmg on kitenet.net be directed?  Or, bugs filed?


E.g. the CFBundleVersion and CFBundleShortVersionString are never bumped from "0.0.1" which makes it difficult to retrieve and deploy via Autopkg/Munki.


Or, the data in git-annex.dmg.info for the current Mac release(s) (as of 2019-06-23) does not match any version reported in News on git-annex.brancheable.com
(currently distributionVersion = "7.20190508", but  distributionReleasedate = 2019-06-15) when installed git annex version reports 7.20190508.

Thank you
