I got further along in the build process, but cabal couldn't install the \"arm-linux-androideabi-4.8\" versions of `magic` and `terminal-size`. The magic library couldn't be installed because there wasn't an appropriate C library available. The terminal-size library failed with the following compilation error.

```
