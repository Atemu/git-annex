If the journal contains a newer version of a log file than the git-annex
branch, and annex.alwayscommit=false so the branch is not getting updated,
the value from the journal can be ignored when reading that log file.

In CmdLine.Seek, there is some code that precached location logs as an
optimisation. That streams info from the git-annex branch into the cache.
But it never checks for a journal file.

One fix would be to just check the journal file too, but that would
probably slow down the optimisation and would not speed up anything. So I
think that the caching needs to note that it's got cached a value from the
git-annex branch, but that the journal file needs to be checked for before
using that cached data.

Also in Cmdline.Seek, there is a LsTreeRecursive over the branch to handle
`--all`, and I think again that would mean it doesn't notice location
logs that are only in the journal. 
Before that optimisation, it was using Logs.Location.loggedKeys,
which does look at the journal.

(This is also a blocker for [[todo/hiding_a_repository]].)
