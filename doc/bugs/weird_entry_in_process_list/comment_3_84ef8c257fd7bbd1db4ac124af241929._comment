I made it "more intuitive", to the extent reasonably possible.

I don't see why the standalone build is a must. Builds of current versions of
git-annex are available from many distributions.

That C hack would work, but I'm not at all convinced that it's worth adding
such a potentially fragile hack for such a minor inconvenience.
