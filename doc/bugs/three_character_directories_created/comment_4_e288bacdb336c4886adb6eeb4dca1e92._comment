Just wanted to let future searchers know that I solved this problem by finding the most recent commit of the master that was not merged with the git-annex branch and hard resetting to that.  I hard reset the git-annex branch to its most recent separate commit and now things seem to working again.  By hard reset I mean the command \"git reset --hard <commit>\".
