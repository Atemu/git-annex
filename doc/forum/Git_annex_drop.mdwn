Hi,
I am trying to use git annex to store some of the files on my laptop on an external drive. However, after running `git annex sync --content` on both repositories and _then_ trying to run `git annex drop <file>` doesn't free up any space on the local laptop repository. Can anyone point me in a direction to solve this?
