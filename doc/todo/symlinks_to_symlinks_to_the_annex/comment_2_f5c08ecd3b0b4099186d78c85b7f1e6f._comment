Supporting this would require that git-annex stat every
file that non-git-annex symlinks point to, which seems
like it could have a performance impact. 

Also, git-annex is often processing information from git in a pipe,
which can include the link target. In such cases it can very efficiently
see if the link target is an annex object, but to support symlinks to
symlinks it would have to do an additonal round trip through git, which
would be much more innefficient than statting a symlink.

And then there's the question of symlinks which point outside the git
repository, or to another git-annex repository, or symlink loops. 
Now we have potentially security sensitive filename parsing.

It seems like a really big can of worms to open, I am not eager to do this.
You'd have to have some *extemely* compelling use cases. So far, my
response to the use cases provided is:
"Doctor, Doctorâ€¦ It Hurts When I Do This!"
