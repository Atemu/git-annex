Interesting that you say .gitignore doesn't work with assistant because.. it definitely does.

    $ git init /tmp/annex-test
    $ cd /tmp/annex-test
    $ git annex init
    $ echo \"file.test\" > .gitignore
    $ git annex assistant
    $ echo \"test1\" > file.test
    $ echo \"test2\" > file2.test

yields this log file:
    
    (scanning...) [2013-04-08 19:17:03 BST] Watcher: Performing startup scan
    (started...) 
    [2013-04-08 19:17:10 BST] Committer: Adding file2.test

    (Recording state in git...)
    [2013-04-08 19:17:11 BST] Committer: Committing changes to git

git annex find:

    file2.test

On the previous files, the log shows all failed files being added to the annex find after the assistant was restarted (daemon.log.1) so I would imagine 'git annex add' would have worked fine too.

Right now, I'm just running
    while true; do git annex add; sleep 1; done
in the annex directory, which gives me (expensive) watch-like behaviour, with fairly clear output for me to confirm everything has been added.
