Maybe I'm being stupid here--I just started playing around with git-annex. But what's the best way to backup the directory tree and anything else (e.g. encryption keys)? 

For example, if I set up an S3 remote, and then lose my computer, how can I recover from the remote alone? It seems like I can't, unless I also take a snapshot of...what else?...independently. Is that correct? What's the best way to provide this kind of redundancy (against destruction of the local filesystem)?
