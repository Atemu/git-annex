When you asked me if 'git annex add' worked, I wasn't in the position to test it as I didn't have any files in this failed state. All reported occurrences had been added by the assistant's startup scan on its second running...

I've managed to reproduce the issue again and can confirm 'git annex add'ing the file that failed to checksum through the assistant works successfully. The only difference on this occurrence is that I downloaded the files from a local webserver, sharing the files from my disk as it was taking several gigabytes of download to occur. All other files were added successfully.

daemon.log

    [2013-04-08 22:41:13 BST] Committer: Adding blender_l.eos_04.zip
    add blender_lowpoly_videos_04.zip (checksum...) failed

git annex add

    $ git annex add blender_lowpoly_videos_04.zip
    add blender_lowpoly_videos_04.zip (checksum...) ok

In case it matters at all, the workaround I am using below has not demonstrated the issue yet:

    while true; do git annex add; sleep 1; done

Still very interesting that .gitignore is not supposed to work. After running through the test case on my machine:
Restarting the assistant doesn't add file.test
'git annex add' doesn't add file.test
'git annex add file.test' doesn't add file.test

Looks like it works as one would expect from here. Perhaps I'm in some backwards dimension where what should work, doesn't, and what shouldn't work, does! :) Would certainly explain a lot..

Thanks for your help. As you can probably tell, I really want to use git-annex!
