I have the same use case as Asheesh but I want to be able to see which filenames point to the same objects and then decide which of the duplicates to drop myself.  I think

    git annex drop --by-contents

would be the wrong approach because how does git-annex know which ones to drop?  There's too much potential for error.

Instead it would be great to have something like

    git annex finddups

While it's easy enough to knock up a bit of shell or Perl to achieve this, that relies on knowledge of the annex symlink structure, so I think really it belongs inside git-annex.

If this command gave output similar to the excellent `fastdup` utility:

    Scanning for files... 672 files in 10.439 seconds
    Comparing 2 sets of files...

    2 files (70.71 MB/ea)
            /home/adam/media/flat/tour/flat-tour.3gp
            /home/adam/videos/tour.3gp

    Found 1 duplicate of 1 file (70.71 MB wasted)
    Scanned 672 files (1.96 GB) in 11.415 seconds

then you could do stuff like

    git annex finddups | grep /home/adam/media/flat | xargs rm
