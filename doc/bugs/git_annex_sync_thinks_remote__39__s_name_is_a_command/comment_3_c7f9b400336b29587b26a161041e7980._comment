From the debug output, it's apparently `git fetch origin` (and also the `git
push origin`) that is, somehow, resuting in the error message.

But, I'll bet it doesn't happen if you run `git fetch origin` by hand, does
it?

My best guess is that this is somehow related to the ssh connection
caching code. To make ssh connection caching work, git-annex sets
`GIT_SSH=git-annex`. This would result in `git fetch` running `git annex i3`
as we see here, but with some environment variables set that would make
git-annex know that it's supposed to be handling a ssh caching scenario.

Perhaps you have a really old version of git-annex, that doesn't know about
that ssh caching environment, installed someplace, in addition to the more
recent version that's in you path. If the old version somehow gets run by
git, it would explain this behavior.

To check this theory, first try disabling ssh caching temporarily, and see if
that avoids the problem:

	git config annex.sshcaching false
	git annex sync
	git config annex.sshcaching true

If that did avoid the problem, take a look at
`~/.config/git-annex/program`. It probably points to the location of an old
version of git-annex. Likely one installed from the standalone tarball.
Removing that file would then solve your problem.
