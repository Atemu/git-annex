Is this command also for renaming or moving files, like `git mv`?

If not, I think this should be explained more clearly in the documentation.

If not, how would I move/rename files then? As I understand, annexed files are just symlinks. So if I would move the file to another directory (e.g. via `git mv` or just `mv`), the symlink might break.
