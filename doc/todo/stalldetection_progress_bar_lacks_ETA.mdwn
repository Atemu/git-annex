Unsure why, but when annex.stalldetection is set, the progress info it
communicates results in a progress display w/o ETA sometimes.
In particular, it seems to happen downloading from ssh, when the key does
not have a size. Normally, the size is learned during download and used in
the progress bar, but somehow this does not happen. --[[Joey]]
