I would like to revive this request for lower-case file extensions in the SHA256E backend. At some point, I migrated all my photos to use lower-case filenames.  However, the images stored on the SD card of my camera still use upper-case filenames including the extension. I would love to be able to use git annex import --clean-duplicates to remove already imported images from the SD card. However, this no longer works due to my files being directly added with lower-case extensions.
