The command uses `git fsck` to get a list of git objects that are missing
from the repository. It then tries to get those objects from remotes. So,
skipping the fsck is not really possible.

Also in some cases, it may need to fsck again after the initial pass.

You must have an exceptionally large git repo (and/or slow computer) for git
fsck to take more than several minutes.

I wonder if passing --connectivity-only to git fsck speeds it up
significantly for you? Actually corrupted blobs are probably much rarer
than blobs that are just missing, so it might be that git annex repair
could optionally use that to run fsck faster.
