# NAME

git-annex contentlocation - looks up content for a key

# SYNOPSIS

git annex contentlocation `[key ...]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command looks up filename used to store the content 
of a key. The filename is output to stdout. If the key's content is not
present in the local repository, nothing is output, and it exits nonzero.

Note that in direct mode, the file will typically be in the git work
tree, and while its content should correspond to the key, the file
could become modified at any time after git-annex checks it.
