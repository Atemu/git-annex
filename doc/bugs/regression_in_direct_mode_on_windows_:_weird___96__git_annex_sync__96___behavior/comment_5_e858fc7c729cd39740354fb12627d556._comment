All Windows and Android builds have been updated with the bug fixed.

Test suite fixed to test `git annex sync` on Windows.. although the test suite is still failing for unknown reasons in the autobuilder environment and so does not stop the build. I have added a recommendation to the Windows install page that users run `git annex test` themselves to make sure they have a good build that works on their Windows system.
