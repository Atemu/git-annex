    `findref` still displays file names, so OK, I can pipe the output with `lookupkey` to have the corresponding list of keys

Actually, that's not even true: `lookupkey` doesn't seem to work on a bare repo. So I don't see how I can get the list of keys that are going to be moved or copied when a `git annex move ...` or `git annex copy ...` is run from a bare repo.
