The recent switch to using the Glob library seems to be responsible for this problem. It seems that
with Glob, \"*\" matches \"foo\", but not \"directory/foo\", so the \"*\" in preferred content for backup repositories matches only files in the top directory!

Writing test cases and fixing this now.
