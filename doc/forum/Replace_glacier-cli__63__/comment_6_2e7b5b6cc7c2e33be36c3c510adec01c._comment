I've never used git-annex, so I'm not particularly enthusiastic about developing for it. If someone could describe what glacier actions are needed I could maybe code something up.
In any case, wouldn't we want to wait until a version of amazonka with functioning glacier support is released? Unless you'd want to add my git fork of the repo as a dependency...
