I just upgraded to 6.20160114-g297a744. `git annex version` shows me `S3(multipartupload)`, and trying to set `storageclass=STANDARD_IA` still leaves the storageclass as `Standard`. Would it show `S3(multipartupload,storageclasses)` if it had `STANDARD_IA` support from `aws-0.13`? I see that `aws-0.13.0` was added to Debian unstable on 2016/01/11 -- was that too close to make the 2016/01/14 release?
