@arseny-n the misctemp directory does not normally contain anything, or
only temp files in use by the currently running git-annex process for a
short amount of time. The only way I know of that it can get files piled up
in it is when you kill the git-annex process while it's using such a file.

It's always safe to delete the files in misctemp as long as git-annex is
not running. Also, the names of the files should give a pretty good clue
about what git-annex was using the file for. For example "jlog" files are
used for staging the journal.
