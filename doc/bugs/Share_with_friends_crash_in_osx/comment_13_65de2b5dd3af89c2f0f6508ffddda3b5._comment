Well that's good and unexpected news!

I did make some changes on the OSX autobuilder recently. For one thing, I updated and rebuilt all the homebrew stuff, and remembered to pass --build-bottle when doing so. Which I think I had always done before.. Homebrew also removed some dependencies on gnutls in wget, and perhaps they also made other changes -- I'd not be surprised if a change to homebrew made --build-bottle start disabling some optimisations.

In any case, I suppose I can close this bug now..
