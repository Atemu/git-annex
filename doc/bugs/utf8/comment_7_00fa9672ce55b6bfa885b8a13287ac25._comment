The only version of git-annex that matters is the one installed on the Android device. Which is fine.

I reiterate my request for the actual thing that got obfuscated as \"/data/data/ga.androidterm/tmp/fozz@...somethingthatlookslikeahash\". Once I have that peice of information I should be able to fix this bug in short order. I understand exactly what's going on, except I don't know what the actual length of the filename that is causing the problem is.
