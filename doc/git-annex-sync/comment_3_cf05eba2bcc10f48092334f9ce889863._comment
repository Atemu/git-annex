Maybe, have a config option for the number of retries or the maximum time to keep trying?  An important property of git-annex-sync is that, even though it does merging, it does not normally fail.  It'd be good to keep that guarantee even in the face of concurrent access to the repo.  Alternately, you could push to a new branch synced/uuid/branchname, and then when git-annex-sync is later done at the target repo locally, merge from each of the synced/*/branchname .
