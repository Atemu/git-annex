# NAME

git-annex checkpresentkey - check if key is present in remote

# SYNOPSIS

git annex checkpresentkey `key` `[remote]`

# DESCRIPTION

This plumbing-level command verifies if the specified key's content
is present in the specified remote.

When no remote is specified, it verifies if the key's content is present
in any accessible remotes.

Exits 0 if the content is verified present in the remote, or 1 if it is
verified to not be present in the remote. If there is a problem, 
the special exit code 100 is used, and an error message is output to stderr.

# OPTIONS

* `--batch`

  Enables batch mode. In this mode, the `key` is not specified at the
  command line, but the `remote` may still be. Lines containing keys are
  read from stdin, and a line is output with "1" if the key is verified to
  be present, and "0" otherwise.
