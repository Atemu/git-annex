>Falling back to hardcoded app location;         cannot find expected files in /data/app-lib
>u0_a33@mako:/sdcard/git-annex.home $     git annex webapp
>CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE: git-annex     invalid R_ARM_COPY relocation against     DT_SYMBOLIC shared library libc.so (built.    with -Bsymbolic?)
>1|u0_a33@mako:/sdcard/git-annex.home $
