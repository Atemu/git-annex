[[/profiling]] has a history of `+RTS -p` profiles in the same repo.
Comparing against the 10 month old one there, current git-annex find
runs in same time, and actually allocates slightly less memory, 583357880
bytes down from 608475328. That's memory churn, not max memory usage,
so doesn't rule out a memory leak. But if there is one, it's memory that
was allocated before, so it would need to be a laziness bug I think.
And the profiles are not showing another such leak.

My feeling is, what's left now is all due to a change to haskell runtime's
memory management, or a library. So not worth keeping this open for since I
can't do anything about it except for keep an eye on it.
