News for git-annex 3.20110702:

   The URL backend has been removed. Instead the new web remote can be used.

git-annex 3.20110702 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Now the web can be used as a special remote.
     This feature replaces the old URL backend.
   * addurl: New command to download an url and store it in the annex.
   * Sped back up fsck, copy --from, and other commands that often
     have to read a lot of information from the git-annex branch. Such
     commands are now faster than they were before introduction of the
     git-annex branch.
   * Always ensure git-annex branch exists.
   * Modify location log parser to allow future expansion.
   * --force will cause add, etc, to operate on ignored files.
   * Avoid mangling encoding when storing the description of repository
     and other content.
   * cabal can now be used to build git-annex. This is substantially
     slower than using make, does not build or install documentation,
     does not run the test suite, and is not particularly recommended,
     but could be useful to some."""]]
