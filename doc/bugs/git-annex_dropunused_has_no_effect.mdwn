Hi Joey,

I have a repository with many thousands of unused files.  It's hard to know exactly how many because it takes up to 5 seconds to print the name of every single one, so I'm largely guessing based on my knowledge of what I've recently deleted.

When I run `git annex dropunused FOO`, it doesn't matter what `FOO` is -- a number, a range, the word "foo" -- the `dropunused` command returns to the prompt instantly in all cases.

What can I do to drop all these unused files eating up i-nodes?  Is there a debug flag I can turn on?

Thanks,
  John
