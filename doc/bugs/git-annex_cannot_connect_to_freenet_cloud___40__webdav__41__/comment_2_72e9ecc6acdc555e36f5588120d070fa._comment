The first failure is git-annex sending MKCOL (make directory basically).
The server fails with "Unauthorized". You say it also made the directory.
That's got to be a bug in the server, no? It can't sanely have an authorization
problem and also go on and do the unathorized action.

The second failure is git-annex sending PUT. This is the most basic
operation for webdav server to support AFAIK,
and it fails with "NotImplemented".

It's also kind of telling that the webdav server
has a message baked into it about not working with the OSX Finder.
Overall, this seems a very bad webdav server.

If you were able to upload files using a different webdav client,
I guess that client must have used a command other than PUT, or
done something else different with the protocol. If you can track down
details of how the client manage to talk to this strange server, we could
see about supporting it.
